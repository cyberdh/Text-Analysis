    "You will need to have set up a [Karst account](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bezu#account) first. Once you have your Karst account simply go to [rstudio.iu.edu](https://rstudio.iu.edu/auth-sign-in) and login using your IU username and passphrase.  Next, set the working directory by pointing to the location on Karst where you have stored the files. Below, we have chosen to save the folder \"Text-Analysis\" as a \"Project\" in R Studio on the Karst super-computer here at Indiana University. It contains the R scripts, texts, notebooks, and results. If you have forked and cloned the Github repository (see [textPrep.Rmd](textPrep.Rmd) for directions on how), simply point to where you have saved the folder. If you save it to your personal Karst folder, it will most likely look very similar to the example below. Karst is a unix server and so the home directory is represented by a ~ and, thus, the path will look like this \"~/Text-Analysis/\" (with the quotes). Alternatively, if you are on a PC, you will need to use an absolute path such as \"C:/Users/XXX\" (with the quotes again).\n",

This will set your working directory in the console pane, but make sure to copy the path into the source pane above to keep the directory constant if you close this script and reopen later. Make sure you click on the blue cube with a \"R\" in the center to set your working directory to your Text-Analysis project path.\n",

During this limited period I have had very limited experience with UITS, but the experience that I have had has been highly satisfying. I have contacted UITS staff on two occasions (had problems with projecting video material in class; a minor technical matter with posting on Canvas); both times staffers were nice and very helpful."

To begin a function which will iterate over all of the elements in the specified object, we need to give it a name - score.sentiment sounds good. First, we set the name of our function equal to function(). Then, we fill the parenthesis with our arguments. Here, we want an argument for the comments (our data we gathered), our positive words, and our negative words. \n",

    "\n",
    "Hint: You may notice some odd expressions in the first few lines of the scores function: they are called regular expressions (or, regex). Regular expressions allow the user to match on certain patterns throughout the entire text. In this case, we are matching on punctuation, control characters (or invisible, non-printing characters), and digits, in the effort to strip out unnecessary characters that do not provide sentiment valence. Check out [this CRAN page](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/regex.html) for more information about using regex in R."

During this limited period I have had very limited experience with UITS, but the experience that I have had has been highly satisfying. I have contacted UITS staff on two occasions (had problems with projecting video material in class; a minor technical matter with posting on Canvas); both times staffers were nice and very helpful.\n",

When I was working on an assignment due at midnight that night, the computer unexpectedly went into sleep mode and would not come out of it. It was 9:00 p.m. and I called UITS for help. They tried telling me a couple of things that I could do, all of which I tried with no success. That was understandable. However, they then told me there was nothing they could do to help me. I was very dissatisfied with the lack of care or information that I was given about how to further solve the problem.</td><td>Undergrad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td></tr>\n",

DUO has some problem-areas - it is recommended that DUO two-step authentication not be applied to all applications requiring IU login (for instance, applications that allow someone to report a stolen or lost ID should be able to bypass DUO authentication, as phones are often stolen at the same time as IDs, which means that individuals can't readily report their cards stolen).                                            </td><td>Undergrad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td></tr>\n",

When I was working on an assignment due at midnight that night, the computer unexpectedly went into sleep mode and would not come out of it. It was 9:00 p.m. and I called UITS for help. They tried telling me a couple of things that I could do, all of which I tried with no success. That was understandable. However, they then told me there was nothing they could do to help me. I was very dissatisfied with the lack of care or information that I was given about how to further solve the problem. & Undergrad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\\\\n",

DUO has some problem-areas - it is recommended that DUO two-step authentication not be applied to all applications requiring IU login (for instance, applications that allow someone to report a stolen or lost ID should be able to bypass DUO authentication, as phones are often stolen at the same time as IDs, which means that individuals can't readily report their cards stolen).                                             & Undergrad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\\\\n",

When I was working on an assignment due at midnight that night, the computer unexpectedly went into sleep mode and would not come out of it. It was 9:00 p.m. and I called UITS for help. They tried telling me a couple of things that I could do, all of which I tried with no success. That was understandable. However, they then told me there was nothing they could do to help me. I was very dissatisfied with the lack of care or information that I was given about how to further solve the problem. | Undergrad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | \n",

DUO has some problem-areas - it is recommended that DUO two-step authentication not be applied to all applications requiring IU login (for instance, applications that allow someone to report a stolen or lost ID should be able to bypass DUO authentication, as phones are often stolen at the same time as IDs, which means that individuals can't readily report their cards stolen).                                             | Undergrad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | \n",

       "1 A couple weeks ago, I had a problem with a desktop computer located in Willkie center building. When I was working on an assignment due at midnight that night, the computer unexpectedly went into sleep mode and would not come out of it. It was 9:00 p.m. and I called UITS for help. They tried telling me a couple of things that I could do, all of which I tried with no success. That was understandable. However, they then told me there was nothing they could do to help me. I was very dissatisfied with the lack of care or information that I was given about how to further solve the problem.\n",

DUO has some problem-areas - it is recommended that DUO two-step authentication not be applied to all applications requiring IU login (for instance, applications that allow someone to report a stolen or lost ID should be able to bypass DUO authentication, as phones are often stolen at the same time as IDs, which means that individuals can't readily report their cards stolen).                                            \n",

    "Now we plot the data. We have to do a separate plot for each set of survey data since we want to view them separately based on Faculty, Staff, Graduate, and Undergraduate. Since all the plots do basically the same thing we will walk you through the plotting.\n",
    "1. To begin, we need to adjust the width and height of the graph output or we end up getting a square shaped steamgraph which is hard to read.\n",
    "2. Then we set an option that will only show us the first three places after the decimal point for any calculations.\n",
    "3. Then we say we want the graphs to be plotted 2 x 2, so two graphs per row and per column.\n",
    "4. Next we say we want a histogram of the score column, what color we want the histogram to be, what the limits of the y axis should be as well as the x axis, what the main title of the graph should say, what we want to label the x axis and y axis, that the x ticks should be sequential from one number to another (-17,17), and that we want to see the totals for each level of sentiment.\n",
    "5. Now we set parameters for the x axis. We determine the style of the x ticks, where the ticks should be in relation to the bars, that the labels go from -16 to 17 and count by 1, and that the labels should by vertical, not horizontal.\n",
    "6. Next we say we want to see the mean score and have it represented by a \"purple\" line at the mean location in the graph.\n",
    "7. Next we say we want to mark the \"zero\" line and have it represented by a \"black\" line in the graph.\n",
    "8. Now we calculate the mean and save it as a variable.\n",
    "9. Next we calcualte the standard deviation and save it as a variable.\n",
    "10. Now we determine how we want the mean and standard deviation labeled\n",
    "11. Lastly, we create legend that shows what the bar and line colors indicate as well as the actual calculations for the mean and standard deviation.\n",
