Next, set the working directory by pointing to the location on Karst where you have stored the files. Below, we have chosen to save the folder \"Text-Analysis\" as a \"Project\" in R Studio on the Karst super-computer here at Indiana University. It contains the R scripts, texts, notebooks, and results. If you have forked and cloned the Github repository (see [textPrep.Rmd](textPrep.Rmd) for directions on how), simply point to where you have saved the folder. If you save it to your personal Karst folder, it will most likely look very similar to the example below. Karst is a unix server and so the home directory is represented by a ~ and, thus, the path will look like this \"~/Text-Analysis/\" (with the quotes). Alternatively, if you are on a PC, you will need to use an absolute path such as \"C:/Users/XXX\" (with the quotes again).\n",

Regular expressions allow the user to match on certain patterns throughout the entire text. In this case, we are matching on punctuation, control characters (or invisible, non-printing characters), and digits, in the effort to strip out unnecessary characters that do not provide sentiment valence.
