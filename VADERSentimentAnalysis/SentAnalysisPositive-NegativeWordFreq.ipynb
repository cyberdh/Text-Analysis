    "\n",
    "Python's extensibility comes in large part from packages. Packages are groups of functions, data, and algorithms that allow users to easily carry out processes without recreating the wheel. Some packages are included in the basic installation of Python, others created by Python users are available for download.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your terminal, packages can be installed by simply typing `pip install nameofpackage --user`. However, since you are using ReD and our Python environment, you will not need to install any of the packages below to use this notebook. Anytime you need to make use of a package, however, you need to import it so that Python knows to look in these packages for any functions or commands you use. Below is a brief description of the packages we are using in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pandas:** An open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.\n",
    "- **re:** Provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl.\n",
    "- **json:** Used to parse and manipulate data in JSON format.\n",
    "- **glob:** Finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned in arbitrary order.\n",
    "- **nltk:** Platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. Here we bring in the VADER sentiment analysis tool which is now a part of the nltk package.\n",
    "- **matplotlib:** A Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.\n",
    "- **numpy:** The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.\n",
    "- **collections:** Implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Python's general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple."

    "First we need to decide if we want to read in one file or a whole directory of files. If you want to read in a whole directory then set `source` equal to `\"*\"` as this is what is called a regular expression that means 'all'. So we are reading in 'all' the files in a directory. If you wish to read in a single file then set `source` equal to the name of the desired file in quotes, but leaving the '.json' or '.csv' off at the end. So a single file should look like this: `source = \"myFileName\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we assign the file type our data comes in to a variable. At the moment the only options are '.csv' or '.json' as these are the most popular forms that twitter data comes in. We assign the file type to the `fileType` variable. It should look like this: `fileType = \".json\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next three variables we assign column header names to. The `negColHead` variable is the column header for our list of negative words in our '.csv' file. The `posColHead` variable is the column header for our list of positive words in the positive words '.csv' file. Finally, the `tweetColHead` variable is the column header for the resulting dataframe our tweets are stored in further down in the code. If your tweets or positive and negative lexicons have different column headers, then make these adjustments here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next four variables are lists where you will add terms that may need to be added or removed from your positive and negative word list. This is because sentiment is often dependent on the topic. When discussing racial relations the word 'supremacy' is generally not a positive term, while a collection of recipes the word is fine. The `remNegWords` variable is where you will add words to remove from the negative list and `negAdds` is where you put words you want to add to the negative list. Always make sure your words are in quotes and separated by a comma. Thus, the `remPosWords` and `posAdds` do the same thing, but for the positive word list.\n",
