That would be consistent			with the other artifacts recovered.					RIKER			Your head is not an artifact.					DATA			In relative terms, perhaps not.			Nevertheless, it seems clear that			my life is to end in the late			nineteenth century.					RIKER			Not if we can help it.					DATA				(curious)			There is nothing anyone can do			to prevent it, sir.					(MORE)       STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow" - 4/06/92 - ACT ONE       6A.8    CONTINUED: (2)					DATA (cont'd)			At some future date, I will be			transported back to nineteenth			century Earth... where I will die.			It has occurred.

Triolic waves			wouldn't harm them. Also might			mean they're shape shifters of			some kind...        STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow" - 4/06/92 - ACT ONE        7.8    CONTINUED: (3)					RIKER			So they could have appeared as			Humans on Earth...					GEORDI				(nods)			I don't think it's anyone we've			run into before... nothing we			found matches up with any known			lifeform...	He switches programs...					GEORDI			What does match up... is a			cellular fossil that might have			just come along for the ride...					PICARD			Cellular fossil... ?9    ANGLE (OPTICAL)	He calls up a blow-up of a one cell fossil...					GEORDI			A microscopic ciliated			lifeform... not that different			from a thousand other single cell			lifeforms that you'd find on any			planet surface... except this			particular one is			L-B-one-zero-four-four-five...			and L-B-one-zero-four-four-five			is only known to exist on one			planet... Devidia Two in the			Marrab sector...					PICARD			Number One, lay in a course...					RIKER			Aye, sir...	He EXITS... there's a moment when Picard exchanges a	glance with Data, like there's something he might like	to say, but then he follows Riker out... on Data's	expression...        STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow" - 4/06/92 - ACT ONE        8.10   EXT.

TEN FORWARD (OPTICAL)	Data and Geordi sit at the bar... a beat in silence...	Geordi is obviously shaken by the events, is	depressed...					GEORDI			So?	Data cocks his head.					DATA			I have no reference point by which			your question can be answered.					GEORDI			So... do you feel like talking			about it?					DATA			Are you referring to the			foreknowledge of my death?					GEORDI			Yeah.					DATA			I have no particular desire to			discuss the matter.				(beat)			Do you feel like talking about			it?					GEORDI			Yeah.					DATA			Why?					GEORDI			Data... it's gotta bother you			a little...					DATA			On the contrary, I find it			rather... comforting.        STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow" - 4/06/92 - ACT ONE        9.11   CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(surprised)			Comforting...					DATA			I have often wondered about my			own mortality as I have seen			others age around me... Until now,			it has been theoretically possible			that I would live an unlimited			period of time. And although			some might find this attractive,			to me it only reinforces the fact			that I am... artificial.					GEORDI			I never realized... how tough all			this must be for you...					DATA			"Tough"?					GEORDI			Knowing that you would outlive			all your friends.					DATA				(blind to sentiment)			I expected to make new friends.					GEORDI			True.					DATA			And then outlive them as well.	A poignant beat. Geordi nods, beginning to understand.					GEORDI			Now that you know you might not...					DATA			... it provides a sense of			completion to my future. In a			way, I am not so different from			anyone else. I can now look			forward to death.					GEORDI			I never thought of it that way.					DATA			One might even conclude that it			brings me one step closer to being			Human.

Geordi looks	down at his drink, shakes his head and grins...					GUINAN (o.c.)			Looked like quite an intense			discussion.	He looks up12   ANGLE	to see GUINAN arriving...					GEORDI			Yeah... talking about life, death,			the future...					GUINAN			Somebody getting married?					GEORDI			Naw. Somebody's gonna die.					GUINAN			Die?					GEORDI			They found Data's head a mile			below San Francisco... been down			there for five centuries...	A solemn expression passes across her face... she's	disconcerted by the announcement...					GUINAN			That's why the Enterprise was sent			back to Earth... I didn't			realize...     STAR TREK: "Time's Arrow" - REV. 4/20/92 - ACT ONE     11.12   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Yeah, something, isn't it?	She looks at him with a unusually concerned	expression... she knew this was coming... she's been	waiting for it...					GEORDI				(continuing)			He seems fine about it... better			than I am...				(stands)			I better get to engineering...	She acknowledges... and he EXITS... and stay on her	for a long beat... and push into her as she says to	herself...					GUINAN			Full circle.	And we may not know what it means yet... but the way	she says it... with fatalist tones... we realize she	has knowledge about this that she has not shared with	Geordi...12A  INT. CORRIDOR	Riker is at a turbolift as Troi arrives... an	acknowledgment and then...					TROI			I heard about Data.					RIKER			Yeah.					TROI			It's having an unusually traumatic			effect on everyone.					RIKER			Yeah.					TROI			If you don't want to talk about			it, it's okay.					RIKER			I'm fine.

Why should I be			angry?					TROI			Maybe it reminds us all of our			own mortality.					RIKER			I just don't want to believe it.					TROI				(beat)			Have you ever heard Data define			friendship?					RIKER			No...					TROI			How did he put it... something			like...				(Data impression)			"As I experience certain sensory			input patterns my mental pathways			become accustomed to them. The			inputs eventually are anticipated			and even 'missed' when absent."	She even cocks her head.					RIKER				(smiles)			You do that very well.

No, go right			ahead.					DATA			I am perceiving an apparent change			in the way that others act toward			me. For example, people abruptly			end their conversations when I			appear... as you did when the			turbolift doors opened.

A	slightly chubby, local BUSINESSMAN.	The Gambler and the American Indian appear to be the	big winners, with considerable piles of currency and	silver dollars in front of each.	They are at the end of a hand.

The American	Indian silently collects the money in the pot, as the	Gambler laughs.					GAMBLER			A poker face carved in marble.	The Seaman puts a meaty hand on the Indian's downturned	cards, intending to turn them over.					SEAMAN			What'd ya have?	The Indian immediately lays his own hand on the cards	-- stopping the Seaman from revealing them.
