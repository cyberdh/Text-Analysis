His flight			team will perform a demonstration			near Saturn that will be			transmitted to the graduation			ceremonies.2    INT. BRIDGE	PICARD, TROI and RIKER are at their seats; WORF is	at tactical, DATA at ops.					WORF			Captain, Starfleet Academy is			requesting an update on our			estimated arrival.					PICARD			Mister Data?					DATA				(off console)			We should arrive at Earth in ten			hours, sixteen minutes, sir.					PICARD				(to Worf)			Please inform the Academy and send			my regards to Superintendant			Brand.					WORF			Aye, sir.	Worf works his console and sends the message.       STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - 1/22/92 - TEASER       2.2    CONTINUED:					TROI				(to Picard)			Do you know Admiral Brand?					PICARD			We've met a few times. She's			a... formidable woman.					RIKER				(ruefully)			If she's anything like my			superintendent...				(off Picard's look)			When I was at the Academy, we			had a Vulcan superintendent who			memorized the personnel file of			every single cadet. He knew			everything. It was like having			your parents there with you. All			the time.					PICARD			My superintendent was a Betazoid			-- a full telepath. When he			called you into his office, he			didn't have to ask what you'd			done.					RIKER				(very curious)			You got called into the			superintendent's office? That			sounds like a story I'd like to			hear.	Picard is not about to tell; he self-consciously	straightens his uniform. They're interrupted by a	beeping from Worf's console.					WORF			Captain, we are being hailed by			the Academy again. It is Admiral			Brand.					PICARD			On-screen.	There's a short beat as Picard waits for the screen	to activate.       STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - 1/22/92 - TEASER       3.2    CONTINUED: (2)					WORF			Sir, she is requesting a private			channel.	Picard and Riker exchange a puzzled look. He gets up	and heads for the ready room.					PICARD			In my ready room.3    INT. READY ROOM (CONTINUOUS)	as the doors open and Picard enters. He sits down and	activates his monitor.					PICARD			Admiral Brand... what can I do			for you?4    ON THE MONITOR (OPTICAL)	is ADMIRAL ANDREA BRAND, a mature, elegant woman with	a commanding voice.					BRAND			Hello, Captain.	She pauses for a beat... there's clearly something	wrong.					BRAND			I know you're a close friend of			the Crusher family.					PICARD			Yes... ?					BRAND			I wanted to inform you			personally... There's been an			accident.	Off Picard's reaction.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                 STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE       4.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            5    EXT.

BEVERLY'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	Beverly and Picard are seated across from each other.	Beverly is trying to stay calm; she is quiet and	subdued, but there's an edge in her voice. She's	concentrating on the medical angle for now... trying	not to let her emotions show through.					PICARD			... he had second degree burns on			his chest and a multiple fracture			of his right arm. But he's going			to be fine.					BEVERLY			Have they completed the			regeneration series?					PICARD			I'm... not certain.					BEVERLY			Wesley's allergic to metorapan			treatments... they'll have to use			a bicaridine substitute.					PICARD			Beverly...	She picks up a PADD and begins quickly entering some	information.					BEVERLY			I should send his complete records			to the Academy infirmary... They			probably have them already, but			it never hurts to be sure. I'll			also send them some information			on a new rybotherapy I've been			working on.	Picard moves to her and his voice becomes softer, more	intimate.       STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE       5.6    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Beverly...				(she looks up at him)			He's fine.	Beverly holds up a hand and takes a step away from him	for a beat... looks back at him and tries to keep a	very firm grip on her emotions, but there are tears	just beneath the surface.					BEVERLY			I know he's fine... I know he's			fine. Let's talk about something			else.				(ignoring her own				 advice)			How did it happen?					PICARD			Apparently, Wesley's squadron was			practicing on the Academy flight			range near Saturn... they were			in close formation when there			was a collision... all five ships			were destroyed.				(beat)			Four of the cadets managed to			transport out... one did not.					BEVERLY			Do you know who it was?					PICARD			His name was Joshua Albert.					BEVERLY			Wesley talked about him... They			were friends...	A beat; she knows it could have just as easily been	Wesley.					BEVERLY			Wesley was so excited about making			the flight team... it made me a			little nervous, but I was proud			of him...				(difficult)			... even though I knew there was			always the chance that...			something might...       STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE       6.6    CONTINUED: (2)	Picard moves to her as Beverly's emotions rise to the	surface once again.					PICARD				(firmly)			Beverly. Wesley is alive and			well.	Beverly looks at Picard... she manages to nod and	smile at him a little through the tears in her eyes.					PICARD			Admiral Brand will be holding a			full briefing after we arrive.			I'll let you know as soon as we're			in orbit.	Beverly takes his hand for a beat and squeezes it	tightly.					BEVERLY			Thank you.	Picard EXITS.

STARFLEET ACADEMY (MATTE)	Est. shot of the Starfleet Academy campus. A large,	sprawling campus in the San Francisco Bay Area.9    INT. ACADEMY HEARING ROOM	This is one of the oldest buildings in the Academy, and	a powerful sense of tradition pervades it. The room	is probably used for both hearings and lectures. There	are several tables, on the right wall is a large	viewscreen, and several rows of benches form a gallery.	There's a small group of people sitting in the gallery:	N.D. PARENTS of the flight team, including LIEUTENANT	COMMANDER ALBERT, the father of the dead cadet. Picard	and Beverly are here as well. The atmosphere is somber	and subdued. Brand is standing in front of the small	table; she's trying to keep this low-key and informal.	She is holding a PADD which she consults periodically.					BRAND				(refers to PADD)			There was very little left to			salvage from the wreckage. We			did recover one of the ships' data			recorders, but it was badly			damaged. We're attempting to			restore the information, but it's			going to take some time.				(beat)			Standard procedure calls for an			immediate investigation by two			command-level officers. Captain			Satelk and I will begin taking			depositions from Nova Squadron			at fifteen-hundred hours today.				(she turns to Albert				 in the audience)			Commander Albert... I'm sure that			everyone in this room joins me			in conveying my deepest sympathies			to you on the tragic loss of your			son.	Albert wants to know why his son is dead... he pushes	Brand.      STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE      7A.9    CONTINUED:					ALBERT			Was there any indication of a			problem before the crash? What			exactly were they doing out there?			Did they file a flight plan?	Brand stops him. Her attitude is sympathetic... she	understands this is a very difficult time for him.					BRAND				(gently)			Commander... I'm sorry... right			now, we don't have those answers.			But I assure you we will			investigate this matter			thoroughly.	Albert pulls himself back and nods... he knows she's	right.       STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE       8.9    CONTINUED: (2)					BRAND				(continuing, to all)			There will be a memorial service			for Cadet Albert this evening in			the west garden.				(beat)			It has been suggested that we			should cancel the graduation			ceremonies in light of what's			happened.				(she indicates Albert)			Commander Albert and I have			discussed this and we've agreed			that commencement should go			forward as planned. The cadets			should know that even after a			tragedy like this, there are still			duties to perform... and that life			continues. Thank you all for			coming.10   ANOTHER ANGLE	as the meeting breaks up. Picard moves to Brand and	they shake hands.					BRAND			It's good to see you again,			Captain. I wish it were under			better circumstances.					PICARD			It's an unhappy way to begin			commencement. If you require any			assistance, Admiral, the			Enterprise is at your disposal.					BRAND			I'm sure we can handle the			investigation... but thank you			for the offer.11   ANOTHER ANGLE	as Beverly approaches Lt. Commander Albert. He is	quiet and shaken.					BEVERLY			Commander Albert?					ALBERT			Yes?       STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE       9.11   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			Hello, I'm Beverly Crusher. I			just wanted to say... I'm sorry			about your son.					ALBERT			You're Wesley's mother...					BEVERLY			Yes.					ALBERT				(beat; his voice begins				 to break)			Josh once told me that Wesley was			the only reason he made it through			astrophysics.	There's a long, difficult silence.					BEVERLY			If there's anything I can do...	Albert nods his head. It's an awkward moment. What	can anybody do?									CUT TO:12   INT. WESLEY'S DORMITORY ROOM	In contrast to quarters on the Enterprise, the Academy	dorm room looks older and more lived-in. It's sparsely	furnished with a desk, a couple of chairs, and a single	bed. Everything is neat and ship-shape.	Wesley is sitting on the edge of his bed. His arm is	in a 24th-century therapeutic device. He's practicing	flexing his arm... it's difficult to fully bend his arm	and he winces in pain. The effort tires him and he	takes off the device. He massages the arm with his	other hand; it's still not a hundred percent.	The door chimes. He gets up, straightens his uniform,	and takes a deep breath. He moves to the door and	opens it. It's Beverly and Picard.					BEVERLY			Wes.					WESLEY			Hi.      STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE      10.12   CONTINUED:	Wesley is stiff and distant. Beverly reaches out and	hugs him tightly. Finally, she releases him, and all	three move into the room. Wesley and Picard shake	hands.					PICARD			How are you feeling, Wesley?					WESLEY			Not too bad... the arm's still			a little sore.					BEVERLY				(gently)			We were so sorry to hear about			Joshua.	Wesley just nods and says nothing. There's a brief,	awkward silence. Beverly tries to draw him out.					PICARD			Would you like to talk about			it... ?					WESLEY			No. I don't think so. Thank you.	Another long beat.					WESLEY			I know you're trying to help,			sir... but it seems like I			haven't talked about anything			else for the past two days. I			don't want to go over it all			again.					PICARD			I understand. But I want you to			know I'm available if you should			change your mind.	A beat as Beverly decides to change tacks.					BEVERLY			All your friends on the Enterprise			wanted you to know they're			thinking about you... Commander			Riker, Data, Robin Lefler...			everybody.      STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE      11.12   CONTINUED: (2)					WESLEY			That's nice.	He doesn't go any further and there is an awkward	silence. After a beat, the door CHIMES.					WESLEY			Come in.	The doors open and Cadet 1st Class NICHOLAS LOCARNO	enters. He's well-built, charismatic, a born leader.	(Production note: cadet rank are signified by vertical	bars in place of the rank pips normally worn by	Starfleet officers.) As Locarno walks in, he sees	Picard and immediately comes to attention.					LOCARNO			Captain, sir.					PICARD			At ease, Cadet.	Wesley makes the introductions... but Locarno's	entrance has definitely put him on edge.					WESLEY			This is my squadron leader,			Nicholas Locarno... This is			Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the			Enterprise... my mother, Doctor			Beverly Crusher.					LOCARNO			Hello, Doctor... Captain Picard.					PICARD				(shakes his hand)			Mister Locarno.					LOCARNO			I came by to see if Wes had healed			up all right...					BEVERLY			How are you doing, Nicholas?	Locarno's feelings are sincere... he's been deeply	affected by the cadet's death.      STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE      12.12   CONTINUED: (3)					LOCARNO			I'm OK.				(beat)			I... just never lost anyone under			my command before.					PICARD				(sympathetically)			I'm afraid it doesn't get any			easier.	Wesley is starting to get a little edgey... he wants	Picard & Beverly out of there.					WESLEY			Excuse me, Mom, Captain... but			Nick and I have some things to			talk about.					BEVERLY			Of course.	Beverly gives him another hug.					BEVERLY			If you need anything at all...					WESLEY			I know.					PICARD			We'll see you at the inquiry.				(to Locarno)			Good to meet you, Mister Locarno.					LOCARNO			You too, sir.	Beverly and Picard EXIT.	Once they're gone, Locarno turns to Wesley, a more	serious look on his face.					LOCARNO			The inquiry is scheduled for			fifteen-hundred hours. Are you			ready?	Wesley sits down. He suddenly looks physically and	mentally exhausted.      STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - 1/22/92 - ACT ONE      12A.12   CONTINUED: (4)					WESLEY				(unsure)			I think so.	Locarno immediately picks up on Wesley's discomfort.	Locorno doesn't want any wavering from Wesley and so	he immediately moves to shore him up.					LOCARNO				(strongly)			Don't worry about it, Wes.			Everything's going to be all right			-- as long as we stick together.	Wesley nods, but he is clearly troubled. Off Wesley's	expression.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                              STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - REV. 1/24/92 - ACT TWO    13.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:13   EXT. ACADEMY GROUNDS - DAY	The grounds of the Academy are similar to any large	university: Neatly manicured lawn and hedges, one or	two statues or busts of alumni, possibly a fountain,	etc. SEVERAL CADETS can be seen moving to and from	class or talking in small groups... there is a somber	atmosphere here as the recent tragedy is still on	everyone's mind. In the distance, the Federation flag	can be seen at half-mast on a flagpole. Picard is	walking slowly across the grounds, lost in thought...14   NEW ANGLE	As Picard comes to a quiet contemplative spot with a	view of the rest of the grounds. There is a large TREE	here with a couple of nearby benches. Sitting at the	foot of that tree (not on a bench) is a young MALE	CADET reading a book. It's a picture-perfect image	that is almost pastoral.	Picard stops and looks at the young boy for a long beat	as if seeing a page from his youth suddenly brought to	life.	Suddenly, a man wearing well-worn coveralls and boots	appears -- this is Boothby. He's an older man with	a rumpled appearance and an irascible disposition...	he holds a sharp-edged gardening tool in his hand...	a grin comes to Picard's face as he watches at a	distance. The old man moves calmly to the tree... the	cadet looks up, reacts as Boothby frowns, looks at --14A  SCHOOL BOOKS	lying in a nearby flowerbed, crushing some plants...15   BOOTHBY	eyes of fire shoot at...15A  THE CADET	who grows pale... and he promptly grabs his books and	takes off...    STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - REV. 1/24/92 - ACT TWO    14.15B  WIDER	as Boothby shakes his head with disdain and kneels down	and begins to repair the damaged plants... Picard	quietly moves over to the tree...					PICARD			Boothby?	Boothby looks up, irritated... raises an eyebrow as he	sees Picard.					PICARD				(prompting)			Jean-Luc Picard... class of			twenty-seven.					BOOTHBY			I know that. What happened to			your hair?	Picard smiles...					PICARD			How are you?					BOOTHBY			I'm pretty damned cranky, thank			you. I've already replanted this			bed four times this week.	Picard kneels beside him to help...					PICARD			Let me give you a hand...					BOOTHBY				(reacts)			You?					PICARD			I've acquired an interest over			the years.					BOOTHBY			Well, careful you don't plant 'em			too deep... the leaves...					PICARD			-- will rot...	Boothby reacts to Picard's knowledge... meanwhile --    STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - REV. 1/24/92 - ACT TWO    15.15C  ANGLE - A CADET	is walking along the path. He suddenly freezes in	his tracks and reacts as he sees a Starfleet captain	on his knees with the gardener...					PICARD			Something wrong, Cadet?					CADET			Nossir, Captain.	And hurries away.15D  RESUME PICARD AND BOOTHBY	Boothby -- who knew Picard when he was just a cadet --	is faintly amused by the lofty status he's now	achieved.					BOOTHBY			Captain Picard... of the			Enterprise, no less... giving the			commencement address...	He chuckles...					PICARD			You sound... surprised...	Boothby rises, brushes off his hands...					BOOTHBY			Surprised? Uh uh. Nothing you			ever did surprised me, son.			Nothing. Except that time you			caught that Ligonian with a			reverse body lift and pinned			him in the first fourteen seconds			of the match... didn't think you			had it in you...					PICARD				(grins at the memory)			Was all in the legs... from all			the running I used to do...	Boothby starts to walk... Picard follows him... and	uncharacteristically struggles with saying what he	wants to say to the old man... this is like finding the	words to say "I love you" to your father... Picard	seems quite young during it...   STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - REV. 1/24/92 - ACT TWO   15A.15D  CONTINUED:					PICARD			Boothby...					BOOTHBY			Hmmm?					PICARD			I don't know that I've ever really			told you... how much...

They are getting ready to go into the inquiry and	Locarno, as squadron leader, is checking over the other	three as they stand at loose attention. Locarno is	a coach here, not a martinet... he's building them up,	getting them ready for some tough times ahead.   STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - REV. 1/28/92 - ACT TWO   16A.17A  CONTINUED:	He brushes off some lint from Hajar's uniform.	Locarno stays in front of Sito, who seems a little	tense.					LOCARNO				(to Sito)			Nervous?					SITO			No.				(beat)			Yes.	Locarno smiles... he's confident, poised... it's easy	to see why people follow him.					LOCARNO			That's okay... so am I.				(to everyone)			But we're going to be all right.			We have some tough times ahead...			but we've always come through for			each other.	They all exchange a few looks... this is a tightly knit	group of people. Locarno takes a beat.					LOCARNO				(quiet)			Whatever happens... I want you			all to know... that leading this			team has been the high point of			my years at the Academy. No one			could have asked for a better			team... or better friends.	A special moment as they silently acknowledge the bonds	that tie them to each other.					LOCARNO			Let's go.	They all file out of the room.    STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - REV. 1/27/92 - ACT TWO    17.18   INT. ACADEMY HEARING ROOM (OPTICAL)	The room has been set up for an informal court of	inquiry.	The flags of the Federation and Starfleet have been	displayed behind the judges' table. Admiral Brand is	seated at the head table facing the rest of the room	along with CAPTAIN SATELK, a male Vulcan officer. An	antique ship's bell sits on the table in front of them.	Seated at a table facing these officers are the members	of the cadet flight team: Cadet First Class SITO, a	female Bajoran; Cadet Second Class JEAN HAJAR, a female	Human; and Wesley. SPECTATORS are seated behind the	cadets, including Picard, Beverly, and the other	parents seen earlier. Lt. Cmdr. Albert is here also.	Locarno is standing near the large monitor, giving	testimony. The monitor shows a schematic DISPLAY of	SATURN, its MOONS, and the five small SHIPS of the Nova	Squadron. The ships are moving slowly toward one of	the moons. Locarno is pointing to the display as he	speaks... his attitude is honest and straightforward...	a completely believable cadet.					LOCARNO			... at this point we accelerated			and executed a starboard turn of			twenty-seven degrees. We came out			of the turn on course for Titan.					BRAND			And you were still in the lead			position?					LOCARNO			Yes, sir.					BRAND			Continue.					LOCARNO			As we entered Titan's			gravitational sphere, I gave the			signal to tighten up and move into			a diamond slot formation.19   ON MONITOR (OPTICAL)	The monitor ZOOMS close on the graphic symbols for the	ships as they change formation... four ships move into	position as four "points" of a diamond, while one ship	slides into the middle "slot" position. Each ship is	clearly labeled by pilot: Locarno in the lead, Hajar	in the slot, Wesley and Albert on either wing, and Sito	in the rear.       STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - REV. 1/27/92 - ACT TWO    18.20   RESUME SCENE					LOCARNO			Remaining in the diamond			formation, we executed a low			apogee turn around Titan... then			began a z plus twenty-five degree			climb in preparation for a Yeager			loop.20A  ANGLE ON PICARD & BEVERLY	As they watch the proceedings. Picard is paying very	close attention to the testimony and the computer	simulation. Beverly is also watching carefully, but	she can't help but glance at Wesley every now and then.21   ON MONITOR (OPTICAL)	The ships on the monitor begin to turn in an intricate	looping maneuver.					LOCARNO				(o.c.)			Approximately nine seconds later,			Cadet Albert's ship collided with			Cadet Hajar's.	On the monitor, Albert's ship hits Hajar's and all the	ships MERGE TOGETHER before WINKING OUT.22   RESUME SCENE					LOCARNO			We had less than two seconds to			activate our emergency			transporters and beam to the evac			station on Mimas. Everyone made			it... except Josh.	Locarno is genuinely affected by the loss of his team	mate and it shows.					BRAND			Thank you, Mister Locarno.	Locarno sits down at the table. Wesley and the other	cadets look a little tense.					BRAND			Cadet Hajar...	Hajar stands at attention.    STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - REV. 1/24/92 - ACT TWO    19.22   CONTINUED:					BRAND			As Team Navigator, you filed a			flight plan with the Academy Range			Officer before the exercise,			correct?					HAJAR			Yes, sir.					BRAND			Did Nova Squadron deviate from			that flight plan after you entered			the Saturn range?					HAJAR			No, sir.	Brand picks up a PADD and examines it for a moment.					BRAND			How do you explain the fact that			the low apogee turn around Titan			was at least two thousand			kilometers closer to the moon than			indicated in your plan?					HAJAR			We were still within flight safety			parameters, sir.	A frown creases Brand's forehead at the evasion.					BRAND				(curt)			That wasn't my question, Cadet.	Hajar pauses before answering. She doesn't lose her	composure... looks Brand right in the eye when she	answers. Whatever she's feeling she tries to keep	inside.					HAJAR			We had discussed changing the			approach after I filed the flight			plan. The final decision was made			en route to Saturn. I didn't			consider it significant enough			to mention here.				(beat)			I apologize for the confusion,			sir.

This is	still an informal hearing and not a court.					SATELK			Did you see Mister Albert's ship			break formation before it collided			with your ship?					HAJAR			No, sir. My first indication of			trouble was when my proximity			alarm went off.					SATELK			Did any of you see the collision			take place?					LOCARNO			No, sir...	The others shake their heads, no.22A  ON PICARD	He frowns at this litany of denial. Something here	isn't making sense.22B  BACK TO SCENE	Satelk turns his gaze to Sito. Sito returns the gaze,	but we sense that inside she's uncomfortable.    STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - REV. 1/30/92 - ACT TWO 21-21A.       22B  CONTINUED:					SATELK			Ms. Sito, you were in the tail			position; therefore, you should			have been able to see any sign			of trouble from Cadet Albert...			and yet you saw nothing?	Slight hesitation from Sito.					SITO			That is correct, sir.					SATELK			Did your attention falter?	Sito is in a tough position... she doesn't have an	answer to the question and is forced to manufacture one	on the spot.					SITO			No, sir. I was... flying on			sensor readings at the time...			I did not have visual contact with			Cadet Albert's ship when he broke			formation.	Keeping his expression carefully neutral, Satelk shuts	off the monitor. Brand leans to confer with him.    STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - REV. 1/30/92 - ACT TWO    22.23thru	OMITTED2425   ON PICARD & BEVERLY	Beverly turns to Picard with concern.					BEVERLY				(sotto)			What's wrong?					PICARD				(sotto)			It's unusual to fly on sensors			alone in that type of maneuver.			A pilot relies on the visual cues			from the other ships to maintain			formation.	Brand taps the bell and brings the room to order before	Picard can speculate further.26   NEW ANGLE	As Brand looks at Sito.					BRAND			If you were flying on sensors			alone, perhaps you could tell us			the orientation of his ship just			before the collision.					SITO			I... don't know, sir.					BRAND				(voice hardens)			You were flying in a ship			traveling eighty thousand k.p.h.,			with Cadet Albert's ship less than			ten meters away... and you don't			know what his orientation was?					SITO			I... don't remember, sir.	Brand is about to really go after Sito when Locarno	stands again.					LOCARNO			Sir, if I may?	Brand considers them both, then nods after a beat.    STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - REV. 1/27/92 - ACT TWO    23.26   CONTINUED:					LOCARNO			Admiral...	Locarno is struggling... he seems very uncomfortable	with what he's about to say.					LOCARNO			Josh was a good pilot... but			lately he'd been having...			difficulties. He would get			nervous during close flybys and			pull away in the final seconds...			his formation flying was a little			erratic.					BRAND				(sharp)			And you didn't report any of this?	Locarno faces her squarely... he is the leader taking	responsibility and he is totally believable.					LOCARNO			No sir, I didn't. We'd flown			together a long time... I thought			he could handle it if I gave			him a chance. I was wrong.					BRAND			Then you're saying that the			accident was Cadet Albert's fault?					LOCARNO				(beat, then very				 reluctant)			I think Josh got frightened and			tried to pull out of the turn			prematurely... and then crashed			into Cadet Hajar.				(beat; tries to explain)			Josh was our friend... we didn't			want him to be remembered as			someone who panicked.26A  ON WESLEY	He's shocked by what Locarno's just said -- but keeps	it inside. The other two cadets trade nervous glances,	but try not to let their anxiety show.   STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - REV. 1/24/92 - ACT TWO   23A.26B  ON ALBERT	Lt. Cmdr. Albert is shaken by Locarno's statement...	it's a hard thing to hear about your own son.26C  ON PICARD	Picard is disturbed... not quite sure what to make of	this new piece of information.    STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - REV. 1/27/92 - ACT TWO    24.26D  NEW ANGLE					BRAND			Please be seated.	Locarno sits and ignores the looks from Wesley and the	other cadets. Brand confers briefly with Satelk for a	moment. Brand looks directly at the members of the	Nova Squadron for a long beat. There is an edge of	anger in her voice.					BRAND			I am... disturbed by what I've			heard here today. By your own			admission, you allowed your			teammate to fly when you knew he			was having difficulties			maintaining formation. That			demonstrates a serious lack of			judgment.				(beat)			I am also disturbed by the fact			that you did not come forward with			this information immediately.				(picks up PADD)			We should have the first data			from Mister Crusher's flight			recorder tonight. We will			reconvene at thirteen hundred			hours tomorrow.	She taps the bell and everyone stands up as the inquiry	is recessed.26E  ON THE FLIGHT TEAM	They stand up and Wesley turns to face Locarno.	Locarno is cool... he smiles confidently.					LOCARNO			Everything's fine. Trust me.	Locarno EXITS along with the crowd. Hajar and Sito	follow him and Wesley is left feeling a swirl of	conflicting emotions.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT TWO                               STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - 1/22/92 - ACT THREE     25.                           ACT THREE                            	FADE IN:27   EXT.

We all agreed not to			lie to them.					LOCARNO			I didn't lie. Everything I said			was true.					WESLEY			The accident was not Josh's fault.	Locarno's tone becomes more personal.

None of them, even Wesley, is ready to	leave the Academy. Sito and Hajar are now firmly with	Locarno although Wesley is still struggling.

I've let everybody			down... my friends, Mom, you.					PICARD			You should feel bad... and you			will pay for what you did.			Admiral Brand has decided that,			in addition to a formal reprimand,			your academic credits for the past			year will be cancelled and you will			not advance with your class.	Wesley is a little taken back by this punishment...	but he doesn't complain.					WESLEY			I understand.	Picard considers him for a beat.					PICARD			It won't be easy... staying here			on campus with everyone knowing			what you did... I think you have			some rough times ahead.					WESLEY			Yes, sir.				(beat, heartfelt)			Captain... thank you.        STAR TREK: "The First Duty" - REV. 1/24/92 - ACT FIVE      54A.68   CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD				(echoing Boothby's				 words)			You knew what you had to do...			I just made sure you listened			to yourself.				(beat)			Good-bye, Cadet.	They shake hands.					WESLEY			Good-bye, Captain.	They leave in opposite directions.69   OMITTED									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
