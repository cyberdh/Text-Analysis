Captain's Log, Stardate 46271.5.
The Enterprise has entered orbit
of Deinonychus Seven. But our
scheduled rendezvous with the
supply ship Biko has been delayed
for another forty-eight hours.
In the meantime, many members of
the crew are taking advantage of
the delay to pursue their own
projects... myself included.
Computer -- stop playback.
Change the clarinet to an oboe.
Continue recording.
Pause program.
Come.
Captain -- we'd like permission
to take the Engineering computer
off-line for a couple of hours.
We've been working on a new
interface that'll allow Data to
act as an emergency back-up in
case of a ship-wide systems
failure.
In theory, my neural network
should be able to sustain key
systems until primary control is
restored.
It sounds like an intriguing
experiment. I'll be very
interested to see the results.
Permission granted.
It's possible we may even be able
to run secondary systems through
Data. Weapons control... sensor
arrays...
Yes. I get the idea, Mister La
Forge. Thank you. Please
proceed.
Computer -- record again from the
first measure.
Computer -- pause program.
Come.
Jean-Luc, I need to talk with you
about "Something for Breakfast."
The play.
Ah... yes... a very intriguing
drama. But I really don't have
the time it would take to learn
a part. And anyway, I'm not much
of an actor...
That's no problem. You wouldn't
be playing one of the leads.
Oh.
It's a very small part. Only two
lines in the whole play.
Really.
You play the butler.
Let me read the play again...
and I'll let you know.
You'll be wonderful, Jean-Luc.
Rehearsal's at one thirty this
afternoon.
Computer -- continue recording.
Enter.
Captain, I am sorry to interrupt,
but I wanted to consult you
regarding the duty roster.
Proceed.
I was hoping we could take
advantage of the Biko's delay by
staging shipwide security drills.
I have planned a tentative
schedule...
Very impressive, Mister Worf.
But we'll be taking on new
personnel at Starbase One-Eighteen
in a few weeks. Surely the drills
can wait until then.
In that case, I will use the time
to perform maintenance checks on
the forward phaser array.
Mister Worf... is there some
reason you're trying to give
yourself more work?
No sir. I simply wished to use
the extra time to...
... Enjoy yourself. You have some
free time. Use it.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Computer, once more from the top.
What did he say?
The Captain saw fit to release
me from my duties.
You mean, you can go?
I can go.
Saddle up, Father!
Where are we?
Deadwood, South Dakota...
nineteenth century Earth.
The Ancient West.
What is our function here?
You're the Sheriff... and I'm your
deputy.
We are in charge of law
enforcement?
Right.
You wrote this Holodeck program
yourself?
Well... Mister Barclay helped a
little.
I must talk with Mister Barclay...
Geordi... I have noticed that you
have not shaved in several days.
Are you attempting to grow another
beard?
As a matter of fact, I am...
What do you think?
As is the case with many natural
growth processes, it is difficult
to envision the end product based
on an intermediate stage.
You're right -- give it a few more
days.
Okay... I'll need to access your
auxiliary inputs...
One moment.
I have to admit, Data... I never
get used to seeing you like
this...
I do not understand. You are
constantly working on similar
electronic systems, yet their
appearances do not disturb you.
Yeah, well... you're not just
another electronic system.
Thank you, Geordi. Nor are you
just another biological organism.
That should do it. Are you ready?
Yes.
I am establishing computer
link-up...
Interface complete.
Alright... let's see what you can
do...
If I ever find the varmint who
drew this... he'll be sorry he
ever put pen to paper.
I'm ten times uglier than that,
ain't I?
Shut up.
You laugh so much, it's a wonder
flies don't live in your mouth...
You are a very funny man, Senor
Eli...
That's the bad guy. His name's
Eli Hollander -- they call him
"The Butcher of Bozeman." He's
killed twenty-three men.
He's the meanest, toughest
gunslinger in the West. You have
to watch him... He's fast...
So I am here to apprehend him?
If you can.
You are under arrest.
Is that so --
You will come with me.
No, no, no...
Computer -- freeze program.
What is wrong?
That was too easy. It's gotta
be harder to beat the bad guys.
Otherwise, it's no fun.
Oh.
Computer -- increase program
difficulty to Level Four. Go back
to where my father and I first
walked into the saloon.
Come on, Father...
If I ever find the varmint who
drew this... he'll be sorry he
ever put pen to paper.
I'm ten times uglier than that,
ain't I?
Shut up.
You laugh so much, it's a wonder
flies don't take up residence in
your mouth...
You are a very funny man, Senor
Eli...
Where are they going?
They don't want to get hit by the
bullets.
You are under arrest --
He's getting ready to draw.
Well... looks like Sheriff Worf
is here to arrest me. Don't sound
like a very bright idea... does
it?
You have been accused of
committing a homicide.
If you mean murder, then I guess
I'm guilty.
I've killed twenty-three men,
Sheriff... one more ain't gonna
make that much of a difference.
'Course... shootin someone as ugly
as you... could hardly be
considered a crime.
Were you just born that way...
or did your momma marry an
armadillo?
I am beginning to see the appeal
of this program...
Sheriff, look out!
Don't twitch a whisker, Sheriff...
'Less you want a shave.
Okay, boys... time to saddle up.
But first... get their money and
jewelry.
You are a murderer... and a thief.
A man's gotta make a livin.
I suggest you find a new line of
work.
I asked Counselor Troi to join
us. She loves Western stories.
You'll regret this, stranger.
I am now attempting to access the
long range sensor array...
Forward sensor array coming
online... we're getting a clear
scan...
I will perform a routine
maintenance check on the starboard
inertial damping system...
Dampers on-line... maintanence
check in progress... Data, I think
we're on to something here...
Let's see what you can do with
secondary systems. Try
gravitational control...
Initiating gravitational --
Data, what's wrong?
There appears to be an energy
fluctuation in my neural net.
I am disconnecting my interface
to the computer.
Interface deactivated.
You alright?
I have experienced a brief power
surge in my positronic
subprocessor.
But I am fine.
Maybe the interface coding is less
stable than we thought...
Looks like we've got a few hours
of systems analysis before we can
try this again.
Let's check the interface
programming...
What are his rights in this
century? Will there be a trial...
or shall I execute him?
We're supposed to hold him until
the U.S. Marshal comes. Then
he'll take him to Rapid City for
a trial.
Frankly, I don't think I'll be
around that long. Not after my
old man hears about this.
To what "old man" do you refer?
My pa. When he comes to break
me outta this tin can... the
gravedigger'll be working
overtime...
Your pa's no match for Sheriff
Worf.
If your father comes, we will be
ready for him.
He's right.
You're no match for the
Hollanders.
I am sure the three of us can
handle any problems.
Hold on. I was just passing
through town... saw a little
trouble... thought I'd lend a
hand...
But I'm not one of your deputies,
Sheriff.
Counselor... I would appreciate
your support in this matter.
Durango...
I'm called Durango.
Oh... well... Counselor Durango...
perhaps you would consider
becoming a temporary deputy?
For a price....
Five hundred dollars.
Alexander -- we require large
amounts of currency.
Yes sir. I'll go to the bank and
make a withdrawal.
Deanna... how do you know so much
about this period in Earth's
history?
My father used to read me stories
about the Ancient West when I was
a little girl.
I must admit... I've always wanted
to play the part of the
"Mysterious Stranger."
You are just so brave... facing
down that evil man like you did.
Thank you. Ms... ?
Annie, you big galoot.
You best not forget that
tonight...
I'm gonna cook you up a beef
steak... and gooseberry cobbler
for dessert.
Sounds delicious.
I bought special candles for the
table setting... pure beeswax.
I will not have time this evening.
I have a prisoner.
I'll watch him for you, Sheriff.
You two go have a good time.
That is very considerate of you.
But I would be negligent in my
duties if I did not stay.
I am sorry... Ms. Annie.
It's another woman, ain't it?
That floosie down at Miss
Langford's House of Pleasure...
Who... where?
You sure got a way with women,
Sheriff.
Computer -- activate Picard
Mozart trio, Program One.
Play back tracks one, two and
three. Tempo allegro.
Computer -- stop playback!
Computer -- identify musical
composition.
Picard Mozart trio, Program
One.
Let's read through Act Two. From
the beginning...
"Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature
An endothermic quadraped, carnivorous... "
Hold it... Wil, what are you
reading?
My lines. Why?
That's not the right dialogue...
Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses
Contribute to your hunting skill and... "
Wait a second... I recognize
this... It's Data's poetry.
The play's gone. I just keep
getting more poetry...
Well.. the PADDs are functioning
normally...
It seems to be a problem with the
information retrieval net. For
some reason, when you tried to
bring up your play, the computer
accessed Data's literary files.
Geordi, perhaps this problem is
related to our interface
experiment.
We'd better run a Level Two
diagnostic on the computer. See
if the problem has spread to any
other systems...
And I will perform a
self-diagnostic.
Good idea.
You'll let me know if you find
the play?
Yeah... Don't worry, it's in here
somewhere.
We got him...
Where's my boy?
I'm not supposed to be kidnapped
now...
Computer -- freeze program!
Hey!
Computer -- freeze program!
You want us to kill him, Senor
Frank?
No...
He's more valuable to us alive.
Feline supplement, one hundred
twenty-seven.
Spot, I have formulated a new
mixture of foods specifically
tailored to your highly selective
tastes.
Puzzling. I find it extremely
difficult to predict what you will
find acceptable.
Perhaps hunger will compel you
to try it again.
Spot, you are disrupting my
ability to work.
You lil' varmint.
The most important thing about
the quick draw is, you've got to
hold your arm loose... like
this...
Now... you try it.
Hell to blazes... I better warn
my pa. We got a regular sharp
shooter here!
Silence.
Worf... Alexander has been gone
for over half an hour. Shouldn't
he be back by now?
Yes... I will go find him.
Watch the prisoner.
So, Mister Hollander... I
understand you've lived a life
of violent crime.
Would you like to discuss your
feelings about it?
What'll it be?
I am looking for my deputy.
Perhaps you have seen him.
Nope.
What'll you have?
Klingon Firewine.
This ain't Kansas City. We don't
got none of that fancy European
stuff here.
Maybe I should bring you a sherry.
That is what they serve over at
Miss Langford's, ain't it?
Howdy, Sheriff.
Commander ... what are you doing
here?
The name is Frank Hollander.
Oh... I see...
What are you smiling at?
Nothing. Nothing at all...
"Mister Hollander."
What is it you want?
My boy.
That is not possible. Your son
is to stand trial for murder.
Well then... maybe we can work
it out. Is there something
you want... in exchange for
my boy?
You have nothing I want.
What about... your deputy?
What about him?
Where is he?
I do not negotiate with criminals.
Your son will stand trial.
Not so fast...
Commander... what are you doing?
I ain't in the mood for games,
Sheriff.
Data... ?
Computer -- freeze program.
Your move, Sheriff.
I wouldn't walk out that door,
Sheriff...
Worf, what's going on?
The Holodeck safeguards are not
functioning. Alexander is in
danger.
My God -- you've been shot.
Computer -- end program.
Troi to Captain Picard.
Troi to Security.
There is a new character in the
program -- Hollander's father.
He looks like Commander Data...
Data?
But it is not Data... I cannot
explain.
I believe he has taken Alexander.
Now ain't that a shame... the poor
Sheriff's been injured...
What's wrong... was my pa a little
too rough on you?
Data... ?
What?
Why would the computer create
Holodeck characters that look like
Data?
Where have they taken my son?
Where is he?
Temper, temper, Sheriff. Pa
wouldn't be too pleased if I came
back all bruised...
Worf, wait...
We've got to remember... the
Holodeck safeguards may be off,
but this is still a program...
If we can get to the end of this
story... the way it was designed
to play out... the program should
automatically terminate.
You are right...
I will begin by speaking to the
people of this town. Perhaps
someone witnessed Alexander's
abduction.
We think our interface experiment
may have caused one of the
computer's core subroutines to
be altered.
When the interface malfunction
occurred, subroutine C-forty-seven
was replaced by elements of my
personal programming.
What does C-forty-seven control?
Library computer access...
replicator selection...
recreational programming... No
critical systems.
That would explain why your music
composition program began playing
"The Slavonic Dances." I have
been analyzing the collected works
of Anton Dvorak.
The same with Doctor Crusher's
play... and with the food
replicators...
The replicators on Decks Four
through Nine have started
producing nothing but cat food.
Cat food?
I have been formulating
nutritional supplements for Spot.
When can you have the problem
corrected?
We are currently attempting to
isolate the corrupted circuit
pathways.
I reckon the process should take
less then two hours.
What did you say?
I said the process would take less
than two hours.
No -- you said "I reckon... "
According to my memory log, I did
not use those words.
Ya'll must be mistaken.
There, Data, You did it again.
Did whut?
Mister LaForge -- perhaps you
should take Mister Data to
Engineering. See if you can find
the problem.
Aye sir.
Can I help you with somethin?
I spoke to several witnesses.
One saw Alexander being abducted
as he was leaving the bank... by
Hollander's men.
We will begin a systematic search
of the town...
Worf... we've got another
problem. I saw Eli shuffling his
cards. He was doing it the way
Data does when he plays poker...
He doesn't just look like Data...
he has Data's abilities. And
his father probably does, as
well...
Howdy, Sheriff.
I came to see my boy.
Remove your weapon.
Take a good look at that gun,
Sheriff... you might see it again
real soon.
Eli?
Pa!
How have they been treating you,
son?
Real bad, Pa. They ain't fed me
since I got here... and the
Sheriff's been roughin me up
somethin fierce.
Don't you worry. The Sheriff will
pay for this.
Who's the stranger?
Don't know... she ain't said her
name. But she's in cahoots with
the Sheriff... and she's mighty
mean with a Winchester.
Sit tight, boy. I'll have you
home in time for supper.
I'll give you one more opportunity
to avoid an ugly situation,
Sheriff. Release my boy.
I have... reconsidered your offer.
I will release your son... in
exchange for my deputy.
I thought you might have a change
of heart...
Meet me in two hours. You be
in front of the saloon... I'll
be in front of the livery station.
Agreed.
Strangers ain't invited.
In every Western I've ever read,
the villains break their word.
We can't trust him.
But we have made an honorable
agreement.
They're not concerned with honor,
Worf. This is the Ancient West.
There's a gunfighter out there
who can shoot with the speed and
accuracy of an android...
And in two hours, he's going to
try to kill you.
Howdy, Commander.
Mister LaForge... what have you
found?
Well... we figure parts of my
memory structure...
... have been replaced with
information from the computer's
recreational data-base.
Specifically, files relating to
the nineteenth century American
West.
That explains the accent...
That's right, partner.
Is this another result of the
interface experiment?
I'm afraid so. But we've
initiated a progressive memory
purge to restore Data's programming
to its original state.
He should be back to normal in
a few hours.
What about the computer's
recreational data-base?
We've started a memory purge
there, as well. It'll take
another hour... maybe two.
You just sit tight, Commander.
We'll have it fixed up in time
for supper.
Good.
I will be positioned here, at the
Eastern end of the street...
Frank Hollander says he will
approach from this end...
Once he gets to this point, he
will be within range.
Understood.
What about Alexander?
There is a rain barrel in front
of the saloon. It should be
enough to stop the bullets.
You wouldn't believe what I went
through to talk Old Man Newsome
out of his telegraph machine...
Excellent.
Lord knows why I keep riskin my
life for you, Sheriff...
Thank you, Ms. Annie. I am...
in your debt.
How long will the field last?
It is highly unstable. No more
than fifteen seconds.
Let's hope that's enough.
Eli -- down!
Alexander!
Senor Frank!
Don't even think about it.
Go ahead and shoot me.
Do not show your face in this
town again.
Father!
Are you alright?
Yes.
Computer -- end program.
I don't understand this. The
story should be over... what's
left?
Sheriff... Sheriff!
You're as handy with a
shootin'-iron as you are with a
lady's heart!
Computer -- end program!
Captain's Log, Stardate 46278.3.
Both Commander Data and the ship's
computer have been restored to
normal operation. Our rendezvous
with the supply ship Biko has
proceeded as planned.
Father...
After what happened... I guess
you'll never want to go back to
the Ancient West...
The town of Deadwood may face
danger again, Alexander. If they
do... they'll need a Sheriff...
and a deputy.
