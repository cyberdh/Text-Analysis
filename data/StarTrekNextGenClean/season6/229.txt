Captain's Log, Stardate 46071.6.
We have been called to the aid
of a transport ship, which has
been attacked near Rekag-Seronia.
Hostilities between the two factions
on that planet have intensified
recently, threatening an important
Federation shipping route.
Captain, sensors have located the
transport ship. Two Rekag battle
cruisers are flanking it.
Red alert. Shields up.
Phasers on line. Photon torpedoes
armed and ready.
Is the transport still under
attack?
The cruisers' weapons are powered
up... but...
Sir, the Rekag ships are turning
and heading out of sensor range.
They don't want to take on the
Enterprise...
We are within visual range of the
transport, Sir.
On screen.
Sensors indicate damage to the
Dorian's sub space emitters.
Audio communication only.
Open a channel, Mister Worf.
Aye, sir.
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the Federation starship
Enterprise.
Captain Talmadge of the Dorian.
Glad you're here... we took some
shield damage from the Rekag
ships... but we couldn't have held
out if they attacked again.
Do you have injuries? Can we
assist you in any way?
No injuries... but I'd like
permission to transport a couple
of guests to your ship.
Of course...
We're conveying a mediator to
Seronia. I think he's the reason
the Rekags fired on us...
...travelling... negotiations...
Captain, I'm losing you. Go ahead
and beam your passengers on
board...
Counselor, will you see to our
guests' needs and then escort them
to my Ready Room.
Yes, Captain.
I'm Counselor Deanna Troi.
Ambassador Ves Alkar...
... and my mother, Sev Maylor.
Counselor, it's imperative that
I speak with your Captain...
You think he's attracted to you...
but he isn't. You offer him
nothing...
She hasn't been well. Could she
be taken to quarters?
Of course.
Chief...
I'll take you to meet Captain
Picard...
Go with him...
Don't pursue him. I won't have
it... I'll stop you...
I am grateful for the
Federation's offer to escort me,
but if I arrive at Rekag-Seronia
on the Enterprise, the armed
Flagship of Starfleet, my mission
as a Peace negotiator will be
compromised. There must be a
Federation transport ship in the
area that could take me there.
With all due respect, Admiral
-- to put the Ambassador on
another unarmed transport will
only invite a second assault.
I believe the attack on us was
an isolated incident, nothing
more...
Ambassador Alkar... the
Rekag-Seronia dispute has
threatened Federation ships for
many months. We are grateful that
you are willing to undertake this
mission... and you have our full
support.
Thank you, sir.
However, we also recognize that
safety is an issue -- not just
yours, but the crew that escorts
you. To send you on an unarmed
transport puts everyone at risk.
I think it's best if you proceed to
Rekag-Seronia aboard the
Enterprise.
Then I have no choice.
Once you get to Rekag-Seronia,
you may conduct your negotiations
as you see fit. Until then --
you'll be in good hands with
Captain Picard.
... I understand.
Good luck, and a successful
journey.
Picard to Riker.
Yes, sir?
Set a course for Seronia.
That is all for today. There will
be another class tomorrow at
oh-seven-hundred hours.
The skills are demanding...
You're very disciplined.
I believe in a strong connection
between body and mind.
You obviously share that
conviction.
Yes... Only sometimes I have a
problem getting my body to conform
to my mind's wishes...
I would imagine that your
self-discipline helps you in your
work...
I don't know about that... I think
maybe my biggest asset is
patience.
I let everybody else talk until
they're exhausted... then when
I start, they're too tired to
argue.
You're going to need all your
patience at Seronia... I can't
imagine how you'll get the two
sides talking to each other...
Neither can I. I won't know that
until I get there. I tend to feel
my way through a situation...
Deck nine. If I were empathic,
like you... I'd have a real
advantage.
I thought Lumerians were
empathic...
Only with each other, not other
species. So... I don't have any
idea what you might be feeling
just now...
Curiosity...
What I sense from you is very
unusual. Serenity... calmness...
tranquility... you seem to embody
the very qualities you hope to
draw out in others.
Tell me, Counselor... have you
ever been involved in diplomatic
negotiations?
Several times... with Captain
Picard. There've been instances
when having an empath along has
been helpful.
I'm sure.
I could use some of that help.
Would you come with me when we
reach Seronia?
If the Captain authorizes it, of
course I will.
I hope to see you again.
You're late.
Mother, I told you I would be gone
for over an hour...
You're late because of her.
Have you mated with him yet?
What --?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Mother, come in, please --
I can always tell. The ones with
a certain look in their eye...
I'd better go...
I'll tell you this... if you do,
you will regret it for the rest
of your life...
Come on, Mother... you need to
lie down...
I'll see you later...
Come in.
Hi. It's that time again...
The dreaded crew evaluation
reports.
Does it have to be today?
It won't get any easier tomorrow.
It might...
What is it?
I've just had a very -- disturbing
encounter with Alkar's mother.
Wil, she frightens me.
The feelings I sense from her
are -- malevolent. They're out of
proportion -- evil.
I understand she's been ill...
and she's very old -- probably
senile.
Listen... we might all end up like
that some day.
You're right. Okay, let's get
through these evaluations. When
they're done I'm going to reward
myself with two pieces of fudge.
First, molecular biology.
Lieutenant Jeffrey Fratis...
She's just a bitter old woman...
don't give her the power to worry
you.
You're right. Okay, let's get
through these evaluations. When
they're done I'm going to reward
myself with a chocolate brownie.
Next, Physical Sciences.
Lieutenant Jeffrey Fratis...
Worf to Commander Riker...
Go ahead.
Can you report to Ambassador
Alkar's quarters? There's an
emergency.
Forty cc's inoprovaline.
I'm sorry, Ambassador.
She was ill... I should never have
brought her along...
Alkar...
She was ninety-three... she'd
lived a long life... I should be
grateful for that.
Counselor... there's a funeral
meditation... part of our
rituals... as an empath you're
the only person on board who could
perform it with me...
I'd be glad to help...
Captain...
I wanted to express my
condolences. This must be a
difficult time for you.
My mother and I were very close.
It will be hard to adjust to life
without her.
Do you want to consider postponing
your visit to Bironi? I'm sure
everyone would understand...
I'm no less committed to my task
than I was before my mother died,
Captain.
I was only thinking of your best
interests...
They will be served if I can bring
the Bironi and the Rekags
together. For a lasting peace.
Worf to Captain Picard.
Go ahead, Mister Worf.
Sensors have picked up a Bironi
warship... in a parallel course
just inside sensor range.
Yellow alert, Mister Worf.
Aye, sir.
You communicate distrust... you
announce your warlike intentions.
It's not the way to enter into
peace negotiations.
I must take the necessary
precautions. One ship you were
on has already been attacked.
And I think you'd agree that a
dead man cannot be a particularly
effective negotiator.
Hello.
Alkar... come in.
The meditation... is one of our
most sacred ceremonies.
Hold the stone... like this...
Rohm gah... sevi rohm... rohm
gah...
Say after me... an end to grief...
An end to grief...
An end to pain...
An end to pain...
Strength comes from love...
Strength comes from love...
And courage from wisdom.
And courage from wisdom.
... Thank you.
Computer... today's appointment
calendar.
Oh-nine-hundred hours: counseling
session with Ensign Janeway.
Ten Hundred hours: counseling
session with --
Cancel them. Cancel everything
until after lunch.
Acknowledged.
You wanted to see me, Doctor?
Yes... I'm sorry to bother you,
Captain... but I'm a little
concerned.
I haven't been able to determine
the cause of death.
She was elderly... and Alkar said
she had been ill...
I found no evidence of disease.
But I did find abnormally high
levels of neuro-transmitter
residue in her cerebral cortex.
What are you suggesting -- ?
I don't know. I'd like to do an
autopsy... but I've already spoken
to Alkar. He tells me that
Lumerian custom forbids it.
Could you talk to him?
Do you have any reason to suspect
her death poses some kind of
threat to the Enterprise?
... Well, no.
Then I can't see any alternative
but to comply with his wishes.
He tells me that Lumerian custom
forbids autopsy except in cases
where contagious disease might
be involved.
Could you talk to him?
We're in the middle of a delicate
situation. I'd prefer not to go
to him with this unless you feel
it's absolutely necessary.
I might be able to find other ways
to investigate. I'll try those
first.
Deanna?
Hello...
Please, come in.
I thought you might like some
company. Unless you're busy...
Nothing that can't wait. Would
you like something to drink?
No.
I'd like you to talk to me.
About... ?
About you. I don't know anything
about you. And... I'd like to.
There's not much to know. I live
a simple life...
What kind of woman do you find
attractive?
Do you find me attractive?
Extremely.
And... when you're attracted to
someone... what do you usually
do... ?
That depends... on a lot of
things...
Is it really so complicated?
It can be.
Perhaps you overthink things...
Deanna...
I'm here...
I'm sorry. If I've led you to
believe...
You are very beautiful... but our
relationship can't be -- like
that.
Deck four.
Wil...
We were going to finish the crew
evaluation reports...
Of course, come in.
Sir!
As you were.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
I was just leaving.
If there's anything else I
need... I know where to find you.
Yes, ma'am.
Are you bothered by his being
here?
Of course not.
Good. Because it's really none
of your business.
I know that...
We were still with Lieutenant
Fratis in molecular biology...
Why do I think you're upset?
I don't know. Could we just go
over these evaluations?
Wil, remember who you're talking
to... you are bothered, I can
tell...
Look, Deanna, I'm sorry I
intruded. When you're ready to
work, why don't you let me know?
I will.
Captain's Log, Stardate 46073.6.
We have arrived without incident
at Seronia, where two members of
Ambassador Alkar's delegation have
been waiting. They have joined
us to report on the situation in
the capital city.
Things have deteriorated
steadily. Rekag sympathizers in
outlying districts have attacked
several towns.
I was under the impression there
was a cease fire agreement.
It was broken before it went into
effect. A Rekag shuttle strayed
into Seronian space and was
destroyed by fighter craft.
Naturally the Rekags retaliated...
there's been fighting ever since.
If they will just sit down with
me...
The Rekags have refused to come
to Seronian territory for talks.
And the Seronians won't go to
Rekag. In the meantime -- they
fight.
Ambassador... the situation sounds
volatile. Perhaps a cooling off
period --
These people need an end to the
fighting now -- to delay a week,
or even a few days, could cost
thousands of lives.
Then I recommend asking both sides
if they will agree to meet at the
coastal city of Darthen.
Why Darthen?
It has been neutral throughout the
conflict. Both Seronians and Rekag
loyalists live there. It might be
acceptable as a compromise.
Contact the leaders. If they will
meet in Darthen, I will join them
there tomorrow.
No. I will not go with armed
guards. I must be a man of peace
before I can ask others for peace.
Very well.
Please send a message to the Rekag
and Seronian leaders. I will join
them tomorrow.
... I know it must be my
imagination... but it seems as
though Lieutenant Pinder just --
doesn't want me in his section.
Why do you think that?
He's so critical... I can't ever
do anything to please him... and
I try, Counselor, I try to make
sure there's nothing he could find
fault with...
Give me an example of what you
mean.
Well, yesterday I was running
routine diagnostics on the sensor
pallets. They checked out...
but Lieutenant Pinder questioned
me because I'd allowed a point
oh-two-three variance. That's
well within specifications.
He goes out of his way to
criticize me.
Do you know of any reason why he
might do that?
No... that's why I'm here.
Maybe he's tired of hearing you
complain.
Pardon me... ?
I'm certainly tired of it. How
do you think it feels to sit and
listen to someone whine about
themselves all the time?
I... didn't know I was --
This isn't Starfleet Academy.
You aren't going to be coddled.
If you can't take it here, you
might think about a transport
ship. There's a lot less pressure
there.
I love being on the Enterprise...
I don't want to be anywhere
else...
But if you aren't up to it... you
don't deserve to be here. Isn't
that right?
I... guess so...
Then you'd better get hold of
yourself. Or be prepared for a
transfer.
I will, Counselor... thank you.
Glad I could help.
Here we go... Bio-filter log
on Sev Maylor...
Geordi, could this log have been
damaged in any way... ?
I doubt it. Why do you ask?
There's a discrepancy between the
log... and the tricorder readings
I took just three days later.
The tricorder shows massive
physiological deterioration
compared to her condition when
she beamed aboard. It's hard to
believe so much damage could have
occurred in such a short time.
Well... I could run a diagnostic
of the bio-filter system. And
your tricorder.
Thanks. But the best way to get
the information I need would be
to do an autopsy.
Ambassador, we've received word
from the Seronian and the Rekag
leaders. Both sides have agreed
to meet with you in Darthen
tomorrow.
Counselor Troi has altered her
appearance...
She certainly has...
Am I interrupting?
Hello, Counselor...
You want him... I can tell. But
you have nothing to give him...
Deanna, could we talk in
private...
And you're envious of him... you
pretend to support him, but
secretly you want him to fail...
That's not so...
Please, you must return to your
quarters.
I won't -- I want to be here, with
you --
Excuse me, Ambassador. The
Counselor and I are needed on the
Bridge.
Of course, Commander.
I don't know what you thought you
were doing in there, but you were
way out of line...
All right, Deanna... just what
the hell is going on?
Imzadi... do you still care about
me?
Of course I care about you. I'm
worried about you...
What is all this?
Don't you think I'm attractive?
This just isn't... you.
But it is.
You want me, don't you?
Deanna...
I need you...
Hey -- what is this?
Please...
Come in...
Deanna... I'm leaving for the
surface.
You said you'd take me with you...
I know... but that's not possible
now --
You told me I'd be helpful... you
needed me...
And I still do. You've done so
much for me...
Then take me -- don't leave me
here...
Tell me... is Liva going with you?
She's been on Seronia for weeks...
she knows the people, the
situation --
She wants to take you away from
me...
Deanna... you are my anchor. I
need you more than you can
possibly realize. Do you
understand that? I need you,
here... making it possible for
me to do my work.
I won't let her have you... I'll
stop her...
I will go with you... don't leave
me... please... Alkar... take me
with you... don't do this...
You wouldn't have recognized her.
Her dress... her hair... everything
about her was...
I'm closer to Deanna than anyone
I've ever known...
But last night she was someone
I'd never seen before.
Do you know of anything that might
have caused her to act like that?
No. I've thought and thought about
it. I don't have an answer.
Computer... location for Counselor
Troi.
Deck six, corridor B.
Ambassador, we've just gotten word
that the Rekags and Seronians are
in disagreement about the seating
arrangement at the conference
table.
I'm not surprised.
The good news, however, is that
the cease fire seems to be
holding.
And that is by far more
important... thank you, Captain.
Chief --
Will you take me with you?
Deanna, I've already told you--
Deanna... ?
I won't let her have you --
Security to Transporter Room Two.
No... let go...
It's just a superficial wound.
What's happened to Deanna... ?
I don't know... every system in
her body has elevated readings...
Take her to Sickbay.
Captain... perhaps we should delay
transporting to the surface.
No... I think you must proceed
with your mission.
Very well.
Chief, transport them to the
surface.
Captain... I want you in Sickbay,
too.
We'll have to sedate her. Give
her twenty cc's of melorazine.
Yes, Doctor.
How's it feeling?
A little stiff, but otherwise
fine.
That'll disappear in a day or two.
Doctor Crusher --
I think you should see these
readings, Doctor. Her
neuro-transmitter levels are
three hundred percent above
normal...
If you remember, I found
abnormally high levels of
neuro-transmitter residue in
Alkar's mother.
Could Deanna have picked up some
kind of disease from her?
I'm not sure.
I need to do an autopsy.
I don't care what the customs of
Alkar's people are. I need to
find out if there's a connection
between what killed her and what's
happening to Troi.
Picard to Lieutenant Worf...
Lieutenant Worf here, Captain.
Mister Worf, contact the Alliance
conference on Seronia. I
need to speak with Ambassador
Alkar.
Aye, sir.
Her brain TECH readings show
neural transmitter production
continues to rise.
Captain, Ambassador Alkar is at
the negotiation table and cannot
be disturbed.
Let me know the moment he is
available.
Proceed with the Autopsy.
Let me know as soon as you have
something.
Medical Log, Stardate 46075.1.
I have performed an autopsy on
Alkar's mother. But instead of
answering our questions, the
results have created an even
deeper mystery.
I don't have any explanation for
this, Captain... but when I
examined Maylor's body... I found
that her heart, her lungs, her
skeletal structure... most of the
systems in her body... were those
of a thirty-year-old.
How could that be? We both saw
the woman.
And that's not all. I compared
Maylor and Alkar's DNA. I don't
know who that woman was -- but
she was definitely not his mother.
Deanna's condition is
deteriorating rapidly. She could
die. There are questions that
only Alkar can answer.
Picard to Lieutenant Worf...
Here, sir.
Meet me in Transporter Room Two.
We're going to the surface.
Aye, sir.
No, she wasn't my mother.
And she wasn't ninety-three years
old.
Captain -- did you perform an
autopsy against my wishes?
Yes, and for very good reason.
Deanna Troi is in Sickbay dying.
Doctor Crusher doesn't know the
cause of her condition.
But I believe you do.
Alkar... we need you. The Rekags
have withdrawn some of their
concessions... now the Seronians
are threatening to break off the
talks.
I'll be right there.
But --
They've been arguing for hours
in there. It seems hopeless.
But now -- when expectations are
lowest -- is the moment I can be
most effective. If I am focused...
centered... free of disquieting
thoughts... I can turn these
factions toward peace.
I'm not particularly interested
in your techniques as a mediator
--
Hear me out, Captain. It's
important that you understand.
You see, I discovered long ago
that I had the ability to channel
my darker thoughts... my unwanted
emotions... to others... leaving
me unencumbered.
Is this... what you've done to
Counselor Troi?
I didn't plan it. I expected
Maylor to live through this
negotiation. Her death could not
have been more untimely.
Then... you deliberately began
using Deanna...
She's an empath. I was reasonably
certain I could establish a link
with her.
Frankly, I was amazed when I saw
how quickly she was aging.
Usually my receptacles survive
for years.
Receptacles... ?
Come now, Captain -- surely you
can see there is a broader canvas
here. If I came to these peace
talks hindered by unwanted
emotions... the Rekags and
Seronians would be condemned to
go on fighting...
No, Alkar... you can't explain
away a wantonly immoral act just
because you think it's connected
to some higher purpose.
Do you know how many people have
died on this planet in the last
forty eight hours? Thousands.
Deanna Troi is one individual.
And you think that justifies
brutalizing her? And the others
you've used?
Ask the Seronian and Rekag
children who go to sleep every
night in fear of their lives.
Captain... I get no payment for
what I do. I have no power base,
no agenda. I am willing to risk
my life simply to help others.
If you think you appear
courageous, you're mistaken.
You're a coward. You exploit the
innocent so you don't have to
shoulder the burden of unpleasant
emotions.
This time you will be held
accountable. I'm taking you back
to the Enterprise to release
Counselor Troi.
I have no intention of releasing
her. Now -- or ever.
Alkar... everything's falling
apart. You have to come now.
Excuse me, Captain. I am needed.
You and your Security Chief will
leave.
Lock on to Alkar's signal and
bring him aboard.
Sir, I am sure the Seronians have
reactivated their security field.
Then work with Mister LaForge
to find a way to break through
it.
I want that man on this ship.
Aye, sir.
I'll be in Sickbay.
If Alkar is flooding her with
this... psychic waste... that
would explain the high level of
neuro-transmitters.
All the negative emotions pouring
into her have caused an abnormal
chemical response in her brain...
Isn't there something you can do
to counteract it?
Enzymic decontaminants will reduce
the level of the
neuro-transmitters -- but I can't
make any headway unless Alkar
stops what he's doing.
He has no intention of stopping.
He feels perfectly justified in
using her until she dies.
Then Deanna has to die.
The only way to save her is to
break the link with Alkar. And
that will only happen if she's
no longer an adequate receptacle.
When Maylor died, Alkar
immediately turned to Deanna.
If he thinks Deanna is dead...
he'll break the link and turn
to someone else -- probably one
of his delegation.
Wait a minute... you're talking
about... about killing Deanna...
I'll be able to resuscitate her,
Wil... as long as it's not more
than thirty minutes... the
question is -- will that be enough
time? Unless he establishes a
link with someone else before we
revive Deanna he might turn back
to her.
We must also keep in mind that
we're putting his next victim at
risk... I'll want every possible
security measure taken to protect
that person.
How... will you...
I'll give her a hypospray of
dylamadon.
It's the most gentle way...
Proceed, Doctor.
Well, my friend, an era of
conflict and bloodshed appears
to be over...
Alkar...
What is it...
I... I'm fine... just a little
light-headed.
You're exhausted.
Do you want a doctor?
No... of course not...
Enterprise to Ambassador Alkar.
Respond, sir.
I'm here, Captain...
You must return to the Enterprise
immediately. Counselor Troi is
dying.
We are prepared to transport you
from the surface whether you come
willingly or not.
There are security force fields
protecting us, Captain --
They won't protect you any longer.
Transporter Room Two, prepare
to energize --
We're ready, Captain.
Computer, note in the log that
death occurred at fourteen thirty
hours... due to respiratory and
renal failure.
Will you wait for me in my
quarters?
Of course.
It is a tragic loss. But her
death had a purpose.
I intend to make certain that
you answer for what you have
done.
Your own Federation Council has
granted me safe and timely passage
to my planet. I expect you to
honor that.
How much longer do we have?
Three minutes, forty seconds...
Picard to Transporter Room Two...
lock on to the young woman in
Ambassador Alkar's quarters...
stand by to transport her out
of there.
Mister Worf, station yourself
outside the quarters.
Aye, sir.
She'd helped me so much... without
her, I couldn't have accomplished
what I did...
I'm so sorry... Is there anything
I can do...
Yes, there is something...
If we could share the funeral
meditation...
We have a minute and a half
left...
Prepare a hypospray of cordrazine.
Yes, Doctor.
We'll use that in conjunction with
the cortical stimulator...
Rohm gah... sevi rohm... rohm
gah...
Rohm gah... sevi rohm... rohm
gah...
We can't wait any longer.
Release the stasis field. Ten
cc's of cordrazine.
Yes, doctor.
Cortical stimulator...
Now.
... an end to pain...
... an end to pain...
Again.
She has a pulse... blood pressure
climbing... ninety over forty.
All right... let's neutralize the
neuro-transmitters. Initiate the
decontamination sequence...
Levels are dropping, Doctor...
down to four hundred twenty
percent above normal... three
hundred eighty percent...
Picard to Transporter Room
Three...
Not yet. I won't know for
certain that it's working until
we get her below three hundred
percent.
... and courage from wisdom...
Alkar... what's wrong?
Neuro-transmitter levels are down
to three hundred ten -- three
hundred percent.
Picard to Transporter Room Three.
Energize.
Let me go!
Neuro transmitter level at two
hundred thirty percent...
Worf to Captain Picard.
Ambassador Alkar is dead.
Wil...
Doctor Crusher thinks he must have
been at a susceptible point in
the meditation ceremony... when
he was somehow vulnerable.
Then the flow of negative emotions
and feelings was reversed somehow --
and went back to him.
That's our guess. And like a man
with no immune system... he just
couldn't handle the sudden
overload...
And... Liva?
She seems to be fine. He never
got to the point where he could
establish a link with her.
When I think back on the last few
days... it's as though I'm looking
at a Holodeck projection... of
someone else.
That's kind of how it seemed to
the rest of us...
Thanks for sticking by me.
I always will.
Even when you're old and grey.
