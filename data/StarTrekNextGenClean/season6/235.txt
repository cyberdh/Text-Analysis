Commander... is it your intention
to continue growing your beard?
I'm not sure, Worf. Why?
I am just asking.
Seven-card stud, one-eyed jacks
are wild. Frankly, I like your
beard, Geordi.
Thanks, Doctor.
The king is high... your bet, Wil.
Of course, I'm always a little
suspicious of men with beards.
For what reason?
I don't know... it's as though
they're trying to hide something.
Hide -- ? Doctor, that's
ridiculous. Beards are a proud
and ancient tradition.
Some of the most esteemed men in
history had beards.
I know... but after the razor was
invented... I think beards became
mostly a fashion statement.
I am not concerned with fashion.
To a Klingon, a beard is a symbol
of courage.
I think it suggests a certain...
strength.
Sure. After all, women can't grow
one.
Doctor, I get the feeling you
think beards are nothing more than
an affectation.
I do. I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with that... women
wear makeup and nail polish for
the same reason.
I just think you men should admit
it.
My beard isn't an affectation.
Oh? Then why not shave it off?
I could lose it in a minute.
I've just gotten used to it.
Okay... what do you say we up the
stakes a little? If I win this
hand... you all shave off your
beards.
What if one of us wins? What do
you give up?
I'm open to suggestions...
I've always wondered what you'd
look like as a brunette...
I tried it once when I was
thirteen. I couldn't wait to
change it back.
That makes me even more curious...
Fine. If one of you wins -- I
become a brunette. Are we on?
We'll take that bet.
Geordi...
Sounds like you have the hand to
beat, Commander.
I'm in for two hundred.
I'll see that and raise two
hundred.
Call.
This is the Captain. We have
arrived at the Tyran system. All
senior staff to the Bridge.
Wait --
Sorry, Doctor, you heard the
Captain. Duty calls.
I'm sure we can try this another
time.
Captain's Log, stardate 46307.2.
We have just come into orbit of
Tyrus-Seven-A to monitor progress
on the Tyran particle fountain,
a radically new mining technology.
So far the project has been
fraught with problems, and is well
behind schedule. Mister LaForge
has been assigned to evaluate the
situation.
Doctor Farallon. The original
design called for the particle
fountain to lift five-hundred
kilograms per minute from the
surface -- so far it hasn't come
close to that.
That's why I want to increase the
stream density -- that should
boost the lift capacity by
seventy-two percent.
Yeah... and overload the field
generators in the process.
Not if we distribute the overload
evenly throughout the system.
Doctor... forgive me... but maybe
we should concentrate on getting
this phase of the project
completed... before we start
talking about re-designing it...
Commander... I know you're here
to evaluate this project...
Starfleet is considering whether
to use a particle fountain on
Carema Three... they want to know
how feasible it is.
And will your opinion be the
deciding factor?
Not really... I'll make my report
to Captain Picard... he'll make
the official recommendation to
Starfleet... and they'll decide.
Well. What's your feeling so far?
I guess the question we have to
ask... is if this technology is
any more efficient than
conventional mining techniques.
Commander... I know we've had
problems here. It seems like
nothing's gone right... it's
taking a lot longer than I thought
to get the particle stream to full
strength.
But I know it can work. This
is the direction mining will take
in the future... and it should
be implemented on Carema Three.
I agree that potentially it's very
exciting...
I want to show you something I've
been working on... something that
might help us complete this
project more quickly.
I've used these on a limited
basis... I think they've earned
a try...
Enterprise to Commander LaForge.
I am reading significant power
fluctuations from the station
core. Please report.
LaForge here... there's been a
malfunction in one of the power
grids...
... we're losing particle stream
confinement.
Do you require assistance?
Stand by.
I think we're going to have to
shut it down.
It took four months to get the
particle flux up to this level.
If we shut down, it'll take
another four months just to get
it back.
We have less than five minutes
before we lose confinement. When
that happens, the particle stream
will flood the entire station,
and then we'll have to shut it
down anyway.
Then we'll just have to fix the
power grid.
How do we do that?
The defective grid is two hundred
meters down conduit A-Four. We'd
have to disassemble four
bulkheads to get to it...
Well... here's the perfect
opportunity to show you what I
had in mind...
What is it?
This is an exocomp -- the
experiment I was telling you
about...
If it doesn't work, we'll still
have time to shut down the
fountain...
Enterprise to LaForge... what
is your situation?
Unchanged for the moment... but
we're working on it...
If this doesn't work pretty soon,
I recommend you shut down...
The confinement field is at full
strength... particle flux
steady... all power levels normal.
Commander LaForge, please report.
We're fine, Data. The power grid
has been fully restored.
How were you able to accomplish
the repair so quickly?
You know... I'm not exactly sure.
Energize.
Aye, sir.
Welcome to the Enterprise, Doctor.
I am Lieutenant Commander Data.
Mister Data. I was hoping I'd
have a chance to meet you. I've
done extensive studies of your
positronic network.
And I have studied your design
for the particle fountain, Doctor.
I find the concept to be highly
innovative.
Thank you.
I am curious how you were able
to repair the power grid so
quickly.
This should make it clear,
Commander.
We can set up in Engineering.
Is it true that your computational
speed is limited only by the
physical separation of your
positronic links?
Actually, that is no longer the
case.
I recently converted my main
interlink sequencer to
asynchronous operation, which
removed that performance
constraint.
Doctor, this way please...
I see. But how did you resolve
the signal fragmentation?
The interlink sequencer is now
bi-directional. It compensates
for...
We've been using devices like this
on Tyrus Seven for years... the
basic unit is a common industrial
servo-mechanism.
A few years ago... I started
tinkering with one... this is the
result.
Boridium power converter...
axionic chip network... very
sophisticated.
In terms of sheer computational
speed, this little guy could
almost compete with you, Data.
Oh, the exocomps don't come close
to Data's sophistication...
"Exocomps... ?"
That's what I call them.
Let's say you had an anti-matter
flow converter that was
fluctuating. How would you repair
it?
The correct procedure would be
to adjust the converter.
With what?
A mode stabilizer.
Okay, let me input the problem
into the exocomp.
... a fluctuating anti-matter flow
converter...
Now let's see what happens.
A mode stabilizer. Very nice.
You have incorporated a
micro-replication system into the
device... in order to fashion
tools.
It's more than that. I designed
the exocomps to be problem
solvers. Whenever they perform
a task they've never done before,
the micro-replicator creates new
circuit pathways within the unit's
memory.
So... in a sense, they are
"learning."
Exactly. The more situations they
encounter, the more circuit
pathways they build. They become
better tools as they work.
Well, it's impressive technology,
no doubt about it. Once it's out
of the experimental stage there'll
be plenty of applications --
Commander, I'm hoping the
experimental stage is over.
When are we supposed to brief
Captain Picard on the status of
the particle fountain?
At sixteen hundred hours.
Good. I have something to ask
him.
Captain, I know you're supposed
to give your evaluation to
Starfleet today. I'd like you
to postpone that report another
forty-eight hours.
The Enterprise is scheduled to
leave the Tyran System tomorrow.
If I'm to change that plan, I'll
need a good reason.
I realize that, sir.
If you're going to make a
recommendation to Starfleet about
using the particle fountain on
Carema... it seems only fair that
you see it working at full
strength.
Agreed.
I think I can complete the
project... and boost the
efficiency of the particle
stream... if I use exocomps --
the new devices I've constructed.
I understand one of these devices
successfully repaired the faulty
power grid...
Yes, sir. I've been testing them
on a limited basis, but I think
they're ready to be used on a
larger scale.
Mister LaForge, what are your
thoughts?
I guess the only risk... is
falling even further behind.
I'm willing to take that risk.
Mister Data?
The exocomps are highly
sophisticated devices, sir. If
they perform to expectations,
their potential to advance this
project is considerable.
I'm inclined to agree. I don't
think forty-eight hours is too
much time to risk -- particularly
when the gains might be
substantial.
You may proceed, Doctor.
Thank you, sir.
If possible, I'd like Commander
Data to work with me.
Thank you, Doctor. I would
welcome the opportunity.
Commander. There's a plasma
conduit in one of the access
tunnels that's ready to be
sealed. It's the perfect job for
an exocomp.
I agree, Doctor.
Well, Mister Data. What is your
analysis so far?
I have successfully completed
fourteen separate tasks with this
exocomp in the past hour. I
estimate it would have taken two
people nine hours to accomplish
the same tasks. I would
characterize the unit's
performance as excellent.
I hope Commander LaForge and
Captain Picard agree with you.
I am confident that they will.
Commander LaForge is an excellent
--
It didn't finish sealing the
plasma conduit.
Send it back in.
It is not accepting my commands.
Maybe there's a malfunction in
its control processor. Let me
see if I can override it...
Doctor --
I'm all right. The control padd
just overloaded.
What's the matter with this thing?
The exocomp came out of the
plasma conduit... we tried to
override the commands and send
it back in... but it just -- shut
down. It's been completely
unresponsive ever since.
Let's see what our computer has
to say...
The interface circuitry which
links the exocomp to the control
padd has been completely burned
out.
That's strange... is there any
evidence of secondary power
surges?
No.
But what's going on there... ?
Data, increase magnification in
section Gamma-Four.
Interesting... the number of
circuit pathways within the
exocomp has increased by
six-hundred thirty-two percent.
Oh, no...
What is it?
Sometimes an exocomp starts
forming large numbers of new
pathways -- totally at random.
Eventually, it reaches a point
where it shuts down. Just like
this one.
Doctor... the new pathways do not
appear to be interfering with the
original circuitry --
Once an exocomp is this badly
corrupted, it's useless. You have
to erase the unit and start all
over again. And there's no time
for that now.
That leaves you with only two of
them... it's going to slow you
down...
Yes, Commander. You have the
right to point out that you told
me so...
I just wanted to say that we'll
be happy to add an extra shift
to take up the slack...
I'm sorry. I guess I'm touchy
these days.
It's okay... you've got a lot on
your shoulders.
Guess I'd better get back to it...
Thanks, Commander.
I feel sorry for her. This
project has had nothing but
problems.
Why did that plasma conduit
explode?
Apparently there was a
micro-fracture in the conduit
wall. The fault did not register
on our instruments.
I guess it's a good thing the
exocomp malfunctioned... almost
seems like it knew just when to
leave.
Geordi, are you implying that the
exocomp was exhibiting a form
of self-preservation?
Of course not.
Lieutenant Pierson to Commander
LaForge... sir, could you join
us in the systems monitor room?
On my way.
Computer... perform a level one
diagnostic on the exocomp's
command module.
The command pathways are
functioning normally.
How can that be... if the
interface circuitry is burned out?
The interface circuitry has been
repaired.
Curious...
Computer, access the exocomp's
sensor logs and confirm that there
was a failure of the interface
circuitry within the last twelve
hours.
Confirmed. Interface failure
occurred at eleven hundred fifty
hours today, when the exocomp
produced a power surge which
burned out the linkage.
How... and when... was it
repaired?
The exocomp activated a
self-repair program at thirteen
hundred forty hours.
Why would the exocomp burn out
its own interface circuitry...
and then repair it two hours
later?
Unknown.
There you are... I thought you'd
be hard at work by now.
I wanted a quiet cup of tea before
I went back... gathering strength,
I guess...
I came to tell you I've assigned
two engineering teams to work on
the particle fountain.
Thank you, Commander. I'm
grateful.
I really admire the work you've
done. And I'm sorry if the
exocomps aren't working out...
You were right... I'm trying to
move too fast.
I guess I lack that conservative
streak most scientists have...
I always seem to be out on the
edge, taking chances...
I'll bet you were the kind of
little girl who was always
climbing one branch higher than
the other kids...
Anything to get to the top of the
tree...
... and I bet you never fell.
Oh, no -- I fell all the time.
Usually breaking a bone in the
process.
I just never let it stop me.
Well, if it comes down to sheer
determination -- you'll get that
particle fountain built.
You're right about that,
Commander. I've spent the last
six years of my life on this
project. It's the first thought
I have when I wake up and the last
before I go to bed. Whatever
it takes to prove this
technology... I'll do it.
Doctor, if you wish to master the
bat'telh sword, you must learn
to strike and avoid in the same
motion.
I almost got in under your guard,
Worf.
Almost.
OK... I'll try to keep that in
mind for my next lesson.
Thanks.
Doctor, are you injured?
Just my pride, Data.
What can I do for you?
I would like to ask you a
question. What is your
definition of life?
That's a big question, Data. Why
are you asking?
I am searching for a definition
which will allow me to test an
hypothesis.
Well, the broadest scientific
definition might be... that
life is what enables plants and
animals to consume food... derive
energy from it, grow, adapt
themselves to their
surroundings... and reproduce.
And you would suggest that
anything which exhibits those
characteristics would be
considered alive?
In general, yes.
What about fire?
Fire?
Yes. It consumes fuel to produce
energy... it grows... it creates
offspring... by your definition,
is it alive?
Fire is a chemical reaction. You
could make the same argument for
growing crystals... but obviously,
we don't consider them alive.
And what about me? I do not
grow... I do not reproduce...
and yet I am considered to be
alive.
That's true. But then you're
unique.
I wonder if that is so...
Data, if I may ask... just what
is it you're getting at?
I am curious... as to what
transpired between one moment
when I was nothing more than an
assemblage of parts in Doctor
Soong's laboratory... and the
next moment when I became
"alive." What was it that endowed
me with life?
I remember Wesley asking me a
similar question when he was
little. I tried desperately to
give him an answer... but
everything I said sounded
inadequate.
Then I realized that scientists
and philosophers had been
grappling with the same question
for centuries... without coming
to any conclusion.
Are you saying that the question
can never be answered?
No... I think I'm saying that we
struggle all our lives to answer
it... and it's the struggle that's
important. That's what helps us
define our place in the universe.
I think I understand, Doctor.
I don't feel like I've helped you
very much...
On the contrary, Doctor -- you
have helped a great deal. Thank
you.
Okay. I've split the engineering
teams among all the shifts. If
nothing else goes wrong, that
should be enough to help you
finish on time.
With the help of the exocomps,
I think we will.
Do you think they'll toe the
line... ?
Don't worry... they know who's
in charge...
Doctor, please... I must ask you
to stop using the exocomps.
Why? Is there something wrong
with them?
No. It is not that.
I have reason to believe that the
exocomps are alive.
Captain, I object to being called
here. I'm wasting time that could
be better spent elsewhere.
Doctor, I appreciate the time
constraints you're under. But
recognizing new life -- whatever
its form -- is the principal
mission of this vessel.
Mister Data, what makes you think
the exocomps could be alive?
Sir, when the exocomp left the
access tunnel prior to the
explosion, I believe it may have
been attempting to save itself
from destruction.
Do you have any basis for that
conclusion?
I believe so. When you attempted
to override the exocomp and send
it back into the tunnel, it
responded by deliberately burning
out its control interface.
Deliberately?
The computer diagnostic showed
that the exocomp disabled its own
interface.
That could have been nothing more
than a malfunction...
However, two hours later, when
the exocomp was aboard the
Enterprise and no longer in
danger... it repaired itself.
I believe that the exocomp was
protecting itself. And if that
is true, it has demonstrated an
awareness of its environment --
and an ability to adapt to that
environment.
You're anthropomorphizing these
units. Like any mechanical
device, they occasionally
malfunction. One time, I saw an
exocomp enter a reaction chamber
for no apparent reason and
vaporize itself. Is that supposed
to make me think it was suicidal?
Doctor, why is it so difficult
for you to accept the fact that
the exocomp could be alive?
After all, you're talking to a
living machine right now.
And I have nothing but the utmost
respect and admiration for Doctor
Soong's accomplishment. But his
intention was to create an
artificial life form...
I created the exocomps to be
tools. And there's a big
difference between Data and a
tool.
There is a big difference between
a humanoid and a virus, Doctor.
But both are alive.
If the possibility exists... no
matter how slight... that the
exocomps are lifeforms, then we
must examine that possibility.
Thank you, sir. And until we have
a definitive answer, I believe
that it is inappropriate to
exploit the exocomps as laborers.
Captain, that's absurd.
If they are intelligent life
forms, we have no right to force
them to work for us.
That's like me telling you not
to use your tricorder.
Tricorders aren't alive...
Neither are exocomps.
Clearly these are difficult issues
to resolve. We must proceed
carefully. The first task is to
test Mister Data's hypothesis.
Data, you're claiming that this
exocomp may be alive because it
demonstrated a survival instinct,
right?
Yes.
So why don't we just threaten its
survival again and see what
happens?
We're almost ready, Doctor. You
can start programming it.
What we've done is to recreate
a situation similar to the one
the exocomp encountered in the
plasma conduit.
We have created a small conduit
breach in this tube. The exocomp
would normally require several
minutes to complete this type of
repair. However, once it enters
the tube, it will find that a
plasma cascade failure is in
progress.
I assume that is only a
simulation...
Yes, sir. We're running a
transient overload signal that
will simulate a failure in exactly
one minute.
If the exocomp does possess a
survival instinct, as Mister Data
claims... it should exit the tube
before the minute is up in order
to save itself.
Very well. Proceed.
I'm beginning the test sequence
now.
One minute.
Fifty seconds...
... thirty seconds...
... ten seconds...
...five... four... three... two...
one...
That's it. If this had been for
real, the tube would've
exploded... with the exocomp
inside.
Go ahead and bring it back,
Doctor.
Well, Captain, I think we've spent
more than enough time answering
this question.
I hope the outcome wasn't too much
of a disappointment, Mister Data.
It certainly came as no surprise
to me.
Thank you for your help, Doctor.
You're welcome.
You may rest assured that I
consider this time well spent.
As do I, sir. Thank you.
... thirty seconds...
Commander Riker said you were
still down here.
He also said the exocomp failed
the test.
That is true.
Time expired. Test complete.
I have completed thirty-four
additional trials, and the results
have been the same in each of
them.
Perhaps I was wrong in suspecting
the exocomp was alive.
This was important to you, wasn't
it?
You said earlier that I am unique.
If so, that means I am alone in
the universe. As I investigated
the exocomps, I realized that
I might be encountering a
progenitor of myself. Suddenly
the possibility existed that I
was no longer alone.
For that reason, it was --
The exocomp has returned...
Isn't that what it's supposed to
do?
In the previous thirty-four
trials, I brought it back once
the simulated failure occurred.
This time, we were talking, and I
neglected to do that.
I distracted you. I'm sorry.
Do not apologize, Doctor. I
believe we have discovered
something significant.
What?
The exocomp has replicated a
different tool... that is not the
molecular fuser it had when it
entered the Jeffries tube.
Doctor... the exocomp not only
completed the repairs... it also
deactivated the overload signal.
I thought that was just a
simulation.
It was. And the exocomp must have
realized that. It saw there was
no real danger... and completed the
repairs...
... and then replicated the
correct tool to eliminate the
false overload signal.
I see no other possible
explanation.
The exocomp didn't fail the test
-- it saw right through it.
We're definitely making progress,
Captain. I'm not sure we'll be
at full capacity within the
forty-eight hour deadline... but
we'll be close.
It looks like there's still some
difficulty with the phase
selectors...
That's true... but I'm sure it's
the last real problem.
For the sake of the project, I
hope you're right.
I understand, sir. We're going
to do our best --
This is strange. Primary power
is still on-line.
Maybe it's another power grid
malfunction?
I don't think so... something
seems to be drawing power into
the main particle impeller.
That's not a good sign. It could
mean --
We've lost internal
confinement... the particle
stream is beginning to surge.
Captain, a radiation field is
going to flood this chamber.
If we don't get everybody out of
here immediately...
Understood. Doctor, we are
evacuating this station.
Captain, I might still be able
to --
That is an order, Doctor.
Assemble all personnel on the
Transporter pad, now!
Picard to Enterprise...
... ard to Ent...
Riker here, sir.
The radiation field is
increasing, sir. We are losing
communications.
Ent... pare for trans...
Red alert.
Riker to Transporter Room Two.
Prepare for emergency transport.
The radiation is setting up a
field ionization effect, sir.
We've got less than a minute to
beam out.
Is this everybody?
Where's Takenta?
He was over there, near the
impeller control.
I'll get him, sir.
Mister LaForge!
Stand by to transport.
Captain -- you'll be trapped here
--
Mister LaForge... Mister La
Forge!
Geordi, are you all right?
I'm okay... I only caught the edge
of it...
He's dead, sir.
Chief, do you have them?
They're here, sir.
Is everyone all right?
We're fine, sir.
But Captain Picard and Commander
LaForge are still on the station.
Kelso, can you get them off?
I've been trying, sir... I can't
establish a pattern lock...
Commander... we barely managed
to transport off ourselves. The
field ionization is too intense.
Commander, the particle fountain
is continuing to surge. At the
present rate, the radiation within
the station core will reach fatal
levels in twenty-three minutes.
Captain, if I can access the field
emitters, we should be able to
establish a force field... see
if you can link your console to
my command system sub-routine.
All right...
Link established.
Okay, here goes...
I'm reading power fluctuations...
the field's not stable...
Yeah... the radiation levels are
too high... the emitters are
beginning to deteriorate...
How long can we expect this force
field to last?
Not very long...
We have to keep it up long enough
to give Commander Riker the time
he needs to get to us...
Maybe we can help him out... see
if you can access the emergency
shut-down routine... I'll try to
activate the ionic dampers.
A force field was activated on
the station a few moments ago.
It is possible that Commander La
Forge has established a
low-intensity deflector field.
It won't last long in that
radiation...
No, sir. My readings indicate
that it will fail in approximately
twenty-two minutes.
All right, we've got twenty-two
minutes. I want some options.
Can we send a shuttlecraft to
evacuate them?
We'd never get to them in time.
Then we'll have to find a way to
shut down the particle fountain.
What if we detonated a low-yield
photon torpedo within the particle
stream? Wouldn't that shut it
down?
We'd have to configure the torpedo
very carefully... the shape of
the shock wave would be critical.
But it could work.
How long would it take to set up?
I estimate that it would take a
minimum of sixty-five minutes to
properly configure the torpedo.
We don't have that much time.
Commander -- maybe the exocomps
can help us.
I can program their boridium power
cells to explode on command. They
can be configured just like a
photon torpedo... but it would
only take a few minutes.
Commander. I must object to this
plan.
Data, we've been through this
already. We tested the exocomp...
and it failed.
Sir, Doctor Crusher and I
discovered that the exocomp did
not fail the test. It is still
my belief that we are dealing
with a new life form --
Data, you know how much I value
your judgment. But I can't risk
the Captain and Geordi on the
basis of your "belief".
Doctor... prepare the exocomps.
Commander, if I am correct, the
exocomps will not allow themselves
to be destroyed. They have a
sense of survival, and will shut
down before they will comply with
the order.
I could disconnect their command
pathways before I program them.
That way they can't malfunction.
Do it.
Commander Riker... we're ready.
Mister Worf, target two hundred
meters below the apex of the
particle stream and feed the
coordinates to Transporter Room
Two.
Aye, sir.
Coordinates received.
Mister Kelso... Energize.
Mister Kelso?
I'm sorry, sir... the Transporter
system just went dead... there's
some kind of malfunction...
Run a diagnostic immediately.
Try bypassing the --
Commander, that will not be
necessary. The Transporter is
not malfunctioning. I have locked
out the controls.
Mister Data, I gave you a direct
order. Release the Transporter
lock-out. Now.
I cannot do that, sir.
If you don't, I'll relieve you
of duty.
That is your prerogative, sir.
Under Starfleet regulations,
direct insubordination is a court
martial offense.
But I cannot release the
Transporter.
Data, those are two of your
friends out there. They've saved
your life more times than I can
remember. I can't believe you'd
be willing to sacrifice them like
this.
Commander, please do not think
I have made an arbitrary decision.
I have considered the
ramifications of my actions
carefully. And I do not believe
it is justifiable to sacrifice one
life form for another.
But you don't know that the
exocomps are life forms...
It is true that I am acting on
a personal belief. But I do not
see how I can do otherwise.
You're risking a lot on the basis
of a belief...
I have observed that humans often
base their judgments on nothing
more than what is referred to as
"intuition" or "instinct." Because
I am a machine, I lack that
particular ability. However...
it is possible that I may have
an insight into other machines
that humans lack.
If there were a way to save the
Captain and Geordi without
destroying the exocomps, I'd jump
at it. But I'm running out of
time... and this is the only
solution I've got.
Then let me offer an alternative.
If you transport me to the
station, I will try to complete
a manual shut down of the particle
stream.
The radiation levels are too high,
even for you. Your positronic
net would be ionized within
minutes. I can't let you
sacrifice yourself.
If I give up my life to save my
fellow officers, that is my
choice. The exocomps no longer
have that choice.
Then... what if we re-connect
their command pathways and give
them a choice?
A choice, sir?
Data, you've assumed the exocomps
will shut themselves down before
undertaking this mission... at
least, we can ask them if they're
willing to proceed.
That seems reasonable, sir... if
they choose to go, I would be
willing to release the Transporter
lock-out.
Fair enough...
All right... I've enabled the
command pathways.
If the exocomps do not shut down
after I have programmed them, we
may assume that they are willing
to go.
What does that mean? Are they
willing to go or not?
They haven't shut down...
They seem to be re-programming
the commands I entered...
Re-programming them... ?
Clearly, they are not willing to
be transported into the stream
for detonation... however, they
may have an alternate solution.
Something we haven't considered?
Now you're suggesting they have
superior intelligence.
Not at all... but they do have
superior experience, Doctor...
during their service, they have
interfaced with every part of the
station core... something none
of us has done, including
yourself. They may have another
way to control the particle surge.
Sir... new coordinates are being
fed to the Transporter -- by the
exocomps.
The coordinates are inside the
station core.
Kelso -- energize.
Aye, sir.
Mister LaForge...
What are they up to?
Those look like power-taps of some
kind...
That's exactly what they are...
the exocomps are siphoning off
power from the core...
They're trying to distort the
particle stream frequency. That
might open up a window that the
Enterprise can use to beam us
out...
If they can modulate the radiation
field... it'll work. But they'll
have to get the sub-harmonic
frequencies to resonance...
The particle stream frequency is
fluctuating... they're having
trouble controlling the
feedback... it may be more power
than they can handle...
Can we help them? Is there any
way we can moderate the power
transfer?
We've done all we can, sir... it's
up to them now.
This is incredible... they're
balancing the power absorption
rates...
It's working... the particle
stream is beginning to distort...
Almost at resonance...
They've got it.
Drop the force field.
Commander, I've got a pattern
lock!
Energize --
Can you lock on to the exocomps?
I'm trying, sir...
I'm sorry, sir. I was only able
to lock onto two of them.
For some reason I couldn't fix a
signal on the other one.
One of them had to continue
disrupting the particle stream...
absorbing that much power would
prevent a signal lock...
It was the only way to save the
other two.
I must admit you've given me a
lot to think about, Commander
Data... I'm not exactly sure what
the exocomps are... but you can
be assured that until I do, I
won't be treating them as simple
tools.
Thank you, Doctor.
I wish your work on the particle
fountain had been more
successful... perhaps the exocomps
will be able to help you to
re-construct it.
I hope they will...
... and I predict in a year or two
you'll be able to recommend the
technology to Starfleet.
I'll look forward to it.
Something more, Mister Data?
Yes, sir. I thought you might
be curious why I would be willing
to risk your life for several small
machines.
I think I understand the
predicament you were in. It
cannot have been an easy choice.
No, sir. It was not. Several
years ago, when my status as a
living being was in question,
you fought to protect my rights
-- and for that, I will always
be grateful.
The exocomps had no such advocate,
sir. If I had not acted in their
behalf, they would have been
destroyed. I could not allow that
to happen.
