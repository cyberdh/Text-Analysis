You're absolutely right, Doctor.
In fact, right now it's hard to
imagine ever hurting anyone...
How do you feel about that person
you used to be?
I feel... terrible. But thanks to
you, I'm much better now. And I
feel confident that when I leave,
I'll be ready to take my place in
society again.
When do you think that will be?
Well... now. Right away.
What makes you say that?
You said when I was able to accept
what I'd done, and understood the
consequences of my actions, that
I'd be free to go.
"Free to go." Are you saying you
don't think you should stand trial
for what you've done?
I'm looking forward to proving my
innocence...
I thought you said you accepted
what you'd done.
But that's not what I meant. I...
I meant that I was sick when it
happened. I wasn't responsible
for what I did...
How do I know that you're not just
telling me what I want to hear?
Perhaps we should continue this
discussion next week...
No. I want to talk about it
now...
You're starting to sound angry
again. Maybe you need another
treatment...
What I need is to get out of this
cell. I'm locked up day and
night... you control every
move... tell me what to eat, what
to think, what to say...
And when I show a glimmer of
independent thought, you strap me
down, inject me with drugs and
call it a "treatment."
You're becoming agitated...
You bet I'm agitated! I may be
surrounded by insanity, but I'm
not insane. And I won't let you
or anyone... me think I am....
I won't let you or anyone think
that...
I'm sorry. Can we take it from
"You're becoming agitated"?
Why don't we break for tonight.
I think we've made a lot of
progress.
But I'm still not confident about
that final speech...
There's such a thing as over-rehearsing,
Wil. You'll do just
fine.
Try to relax. You're resisting
the character. Let yourself feel
what he's feeling.
Maybe I'm just not right for this
part...
Most humanoids have the potential
to be irrational. Perhaps you
should attempt to access that part
of your psyche.
Haven't you ever felt at odds with
everyone -- like the whole world
was against you?
Yeah... my first year at the
Academy...
Try to tap into that feeling.
That's what your character is
going through in this scene.
I'll work on it...
It'll be wonderful. You're going
to knock 'em dead.
"You control every move... tell me
what to eat, what to think, what
to say... "
"What to eat, what to think, what
to say... "
"And when I show a glimmer of
independent thought, you strap me
down, inject me with drugs and
call it a 'treatment'... "
"I may be surrounded by insanity,
but I'm not insane --"
Excuse me...
Tilonus Four? Didn't their
government just collapse?
It's in a state of total anarchy.
When the Prime Minister was
assassinated, a Federation
research team was on the planet.
It is believed they were forced to
go into hiding...
Your mission will be to locate and
evacuate them.
Can't they go to local
authorities?
There are no local authorities.
The government's been splintered --
several factions are vying for
power. And they're desperate for
weapons or technology of any
kind...
Apparently, some factions are
resorting to torture to gather
information. A Starfleet research
team would be a prime target.
Then I'll have to go alone...
undercover.
Agreed. Mister Worf is ready to
give you a detailed briefing on
Tilonian culture.
Looks like I'll have to back out
of Doctor Crusher's play after
all...
No, no... you'll have plenty of
time for that, Number One. We
won't be arriving at Tilonus for
another five days.
Besides, if you back out now,
Beverly will come after me to play
the part.
This is the last known location of
the research team. They had
occupied a small building in the
Southwest quarter of the city.
You will begin your search there.
The Southwest quarter covers over
two hundred square kilometers.
That's a lot of ground for one man
to cover...
I'd better pack an extra pair of
boots.
This apparel will allow you to
pass as a common merchant.
This Tilonian pendant has been
equipped with a communicator
circuit.
It doesn't really match the
outfit...
I suggest you pay closer
attention, Commander. Your life
will be at stake.
Do you understand what I am
saying?
Yes... of course I do...
Because you will be posing as a
merchant, you will need to know
how to use the Nisroh for the
traditional bartering ceremony.
You will be judged on your prowess
with the blade...
I am sorry, Commander! I did not
intend --
That's okay, that's okay...
I guess I really wasn't paying
attention...
I'd better get to Sickbay. We'll
pick this up later.
Aye sir...
You'll do anything to get out of
this play, won't you?
Well, you're going to have to do
better than this...
The play's tomorrow night. I've
still got twenty-four hours left.
Don't get any ideas. I'll expect
you on stage at eighteen hundred
hours.
Right...
It still hurts...
There's no nerve damage... you
shouldn't be feeling any pain.
Probably just a symptom of stage
fright --
He was working on a conduit on
Deck Thirty-seven. A plasma torch
blew up in his hands...
It hurts! Oh God -- it hurts!
I've been on a lot of missions...
and I've seen a lot of people get
injured...
But I've never been affected like
this...
He was looking right at me.
And that was disturbing to you...
It was like he was... blaming me
or something. But it's more than
just this one incident. For the
past few days, I've been feeling
like everyone's staring at me...
or talking about me...
I feel like I'm in "Frame of
Mind"...
"Frame of Mind"?
Doctor Crusher's play. Ever since
I started rehearsing the role,
I've been feeling a little
restless... uneasy...
You're probably drawing on
feelings that you're not used to
expressing...
Yeah. The play is full of
disturbing images. People losing
their minds... being tortured by
doctors...
I can't get it out of my head...
Sometimes it's healthy to explore
the darker sides of the psyche.
Jung called it "owning your own
shadow."
This could be a sign that you're
a real actor, Wil. It's becoming
more than just a role to you.
Maybe you're right...
Don't be afraid of your darker
side. Have fun with it.
Who is that?
You just missed him.
Do we have a new Lieutenant on
board?
I'm not sure. Do you want me to
check the personnel logs?
No... I'll check them tomorrow...
I think I'll get to bed early.
Tomorrow's the performance and I
want to be up for it.
I'm looking forward to it.
Break a leg.
I'll try not to take that
literally.
Perhaps we should continue this
discussion next week...
No. I want to talk about it
now...
You're starting to sound angry
again. Maybe you need another
treatment...
What I need is to get out of this
cell. I'm locked up day and
night... you control every
move... tell me what to eat, what
to think, what to say...
And when I show a glimmer of
independent thought, you strap me
down, inject me with drugs and
call it a "treatment."
You're becoming agitated...
You bet I'm agitated! I may be
surrounded by insanity, but I'm
not insane. And I won't let you
or anyone else tell me I am.
You can destroy my mind, but you
can't change the truth. I didn't
kill that man.
And that's what's driving you
crazy...
I can see we have a lot of work to
do.
No matter what you do, you can't
change the fact that I'm innocent!
I'm not crazy!
I'm not crazy...
I'm... not...
...crazy.
I can see we have a lot of work to
do.
Where am I?
How did you get me off the ship?
The ship again...
What's going on?
I understand this must be very
disturbing for you. But try to
relax.
Tell me. Where were you a moment
ago?
I was on the Enterprise. In the
middle of a play...
Here... but it wasn't real... it
was a stage...
I can assure you this is not a
stage.
Do you remember your name?
I'm Commander...
Commander...
I knew who I was a second ago...
I was on the ship... in a play...
It's getting harder to remember...
That's good. You're starting to
come out of your delusional state.
Delusion... it couldn't be a
delusion. I was there...
We've discussed this. Do you
remember when we contacted
Starfleet... and asked them about
you?
No...
We spoke with Admiral Budrow. On
Starbase...
... Starbase Twenty-nine.
He said he'd never heard of me...
that they had no officer matching
my description...
That's right. Now. Focus on who
I am. Do you remember me?
I'm not sure...
I'm Doctor Syrus.
Do you remember anything about
where you are now?
I hurt my head... somebody hit
me...
You tried to escape. You
struggled with one of the
attendants and hit your head on a
door. Do you remember that?
Yes... now I do. But at first, I
thought a Klingon cut me... with
a knife...
It's called transposition. You're
projecting elements from your
delusions onto events that really
happened.
But that's good. There was a time
when you couldn't break away from
your Starship fantasy at all.
If what you're saying is true...
where am I?
You're in Ward Forty-seven of the
Tilonus Institute for Mental
Disorders.
Why am I here?
We'll talk more later. You don't
have to remember everything today.
You're making excellent progress.
Wait...
Good afternoon. I've got some
good news for you.
Doctor Syrus suggested that you
might enjoy a couple of hours in
the Common Area today.
Well?
I guess so...
I hope you're hungry. They're
serving spiny lobe-fish today.
There's no need for this.
That's what you said the last
time.
I'll be back with your lunch.
I hear you're a Starfleet
officer...
I'm Commander Bloom from the
Yorktown...
There are at least a dozen of us
here... maybe more...
We were kidnapped... brought here
against our will...
Sanders was on the Yosemite. They
did something to his mind. I
think they're trying to get neuro
chemicals from our brains...
Stafko was with me on the
Yorktown. I don't know what they
did to him...
We're going to get out of here.
I've made a communicator...
You have?
Yes. There are three Starships in
orbit. They're going to beam us
out of here any day now...
I'll tell them to get you out,
too...
Lieutenant Bloom to Yorktown...
come in Yorktown. I've made
contact with another officer...
Talking to your Starship again,
Jaya?
No.
Don't let them tell you you're
crazy.
You know you're not supposed to
take utensils from the Common
Area.
You're welcome to try it.
I'm not that far gone, am I?
Of course you are. Last week you
held an entire conversation with
a chair, remember?
No...
Where's your sense of humor? If
you ever want to get better,
you've got to relax.
Your name -- it's Mav... Mavek.
That's right. Not bad for a crazy
man.
I'm starting to remember certain
things, but...
Why am I here?
I remember when they brought you
in. You were screaming...
struggling...
We could barely hold you down. In
fact, just getting the blood off
your hands took over an hour.
Blood?
On your hands... your clothes...
You didn't just kill that man...
you mutilated him.
What are you talking about? I
didn't kill anybody.
I'm afraid you did. You stabbed
him. They found you near the
body... with the knife in your
hand...
No. It's not true...
Yes it is. And if you get out of
here, you're going to stand
trial...
You're lying!
I imagine the punishment will be
quite severe... considering you
stabbed him nine times --
NO!
I was there... in Ward Forty-seven,
just like in the play.
Everyone thought I was insane...
that I'd killed somebody...
Except it was all real.
Deanna mentioned you went to bed
early because you felt a little
anxious about the play. But I had
no idea...
You said that in your dream we
performed the play...
How'd it go?
It was a smash. We got a standing
ovation.
Let's hope it goes that well
tonight.
We've got one hour to curtain.
How do you feel?
I feel... like an actor.
You're certainly starting to look
the part.
Perhaps we should continue this
discussion next week...
No. I want to talk about it
now...
You're starting to sound angry
again. Maybe you need another
treatment...
What I need is to get out of this
cell. I'm locked up day and
night... you control my every
move...
You tell me what to eat... what to
think... what to say...
"And when I show a glimmer of
independent thought... "
And when I show a glimmer of
independent thought, you strap me
down, inject me with drugs and
call it a "treatment."
You're becoming agitated...
You bet I'm agitated! I may be
surrounded by insanity, but I'm
not insane. And I won't let you
or anyone else tell me...
What's happening...
I can see we have a lot of work to
do.
No matter what you do, you can't
change the fact that I'm
innocent...
You're the key to all this, aren't
you? Who are you?
Who are you?
Lieutenant Suna, sir...
Wil... are you alright?
No... I don't know...
Why don't we go down to Sickbay...
There's nothing wrong with you
neurologically. I don't see
anything that could've caused your
hallucinations.
But your heart rate is up... blood
pressure's way above normal.
You're physically exhausted.
This is more than just fatigue...
It's possible under conditions of
extreme stress for the mind to
manufacture all kinds of things.
Drugs. They injected me with me
drugs...
Are there drugs in my system?
Nothing.
It's that dream... they gave me
drugs in the dream...
Did anybody in the theater see
anything strange happen during the
performance?
No... nobody.
Get some rest, Wil. The play is
over. Don't give it another
thought.
Thanks...
How's Lieutenant Suna?
A little shaken... but alright.
I feel like such an idiot.
It's nothing to be embarrassed
about. We're your friends... We
all know the stress you've been
under. I'm sure everyone
understands perfectly...
Commander, I must compliment you
on your performance this evening.
Oh?
Your unexpected choice to
improvise was an effective method
of drawing the audience into the
plight of your character.
You gave a truly realistic
interpretation of multi-infarct
dementia.
Thank you.
Well... maybe not everyone
understands.
I guess all I need is a little
rest... clear my mind a little...
I want you to try a few relaxation
techniques, as well. Remember the
ones I showed you a few months
ago?
Yeah... but they didn't seem to
work for me.
Maybe you need another treatment.
What's wrong?
Nothing... nothing...
Get some sleep, Wil. I'll see you
tomorrow.
It's not real... not real...
Don't let them tell you you're
crazy.
No... NO! Let me out of here!
No! Let me out of here! Help
me...
I need help. I don't want to be
at the mercy of these
hallucinations any more.
So you've accepted that you're not
from a starship... and that it's
all a delusion?
All I know is that whenever I go
back to the ship, reality starts
to break apart... nothing makes
sense. And when it's over, it
fades away... like a dream...
But the hospital... everything
here seems real. I can always
remember what happens here...
And what about how you got here?
Maybe I did kill someone. I don't
know. But I want to find out.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
Because I just had a long talk
with the hospital Administrator.
He told me there are certain legal
questions that have to be resolved
relatively soon.
Meaning?
Meaning we can't keep you here
much longer. We're the only
mental health facility on Tilonus
Four. There are many people who
need our help...
I don't want to put any undue
stress on you... but we have to
settle this case one way or
another within the next few days.
What does that mean?
You're facing a choice. We can
try to help you remember what
happened using Reflection Therapy.
If it's successful, you would be
fit to stand trial.
Reflection Therapy?
It's a way for you to interact
with various facets of your
personality. We scan the regions
of your brain that control
emotions and memory... then
project them holographically.
What's the other option?
A complete synaptic reconstruction
of your cerebral cortex.
Surgery?
We would neutralize the synaptic
pathways responsible for your
mental instability.
You don't seem to like that
option.
I don't. The procedure is
irreversible. You'd be left with
a completely altered personality.
The person you are now would cease
to exist.
Option one is starting to sound
better...
I agree.
Reflection Therapy then... when do
we start?
This afternoon, if you're ready.
I want you to understand this
isn't going to be easy. You'll be
interacting with aspects of your
psyche that you've never dealt
with before.
And you may be disturbed by what
they have to say.
Close your eyes. Try to relax.
Clear your mind.
Now. Think back to before you
came to the hospital. But don't
try to remember specific
incidents. Concentrate on how you
felt...
I was... afraid...
Terrified...
She was on the ship with me...
That's because she represents an
aspect of your personality -- and
there are many parts of you that
still believe you're on that
starship.
Why her?
I asked you to get in touch with
your feelings, and this is the
part of you that responded. Talk
to her about how you felt before
you came here...
You said I was terrified... of
what?
I was in a dark place... cold...
frightened... someone was there...
Who?
I felt threatened by them...
trapped...
You're doing very well. Let's try
to find out how you responded to
these feelings. Try to focus on
your actions...
You felt trapped. What did you
do?
I was angry. They were attacking
me... I fought back...
I felt pain...
I was injured...
I began to panic...
There was a struggle... and I...
You what? What happened?
Try to associate your actions and
emotions with logical thoughts.
What do you think caused you to
act and feel this way... ?
It was dark and cold because... I
was outdoors... at night... in a
narrow space...
I was walking through an alley.
I felt threatened...
I was being watched...
Someone must have followed me into
the alley. That's why I started
to walk faster. Then someone
grabbed me from behind...
I panicked...
I tried to fight them off...
How many of them were there?
Three. They were humanoid. I
could only make out one of their
faces...
Who was it?
He was on the ship too... and I
saw him here in the hospital...
but I don't know who he is...
That's Mister Suna -- the hospital
Administrator. You met him when
you first arrived.
What part of me does he represent?
I don't know...
Don't believe this, Wil.
None of it is real. You're still
with us... on the Enterprise.
Doctor...
We're your colleagues. Trust us.
It's going to be alright...
Do you have anything to say to
them?
You're just... delusions...
Do not listen to him, Commander.
He is trying to trick you. You
are in danger here. Let us help
you...
Stop it... please. Leave me
alone...
Listen to me, Wil. In all the
years we've known each other, have
I ever lied to you?
You are not real!
Wil, please --
NO!
You've taken a big step today.
You've finally turned your back on
those delusions and all that they
represent.
We'll continue later.
It's not real...
Commander... do you know who I am?
Do you know where you are?
If you can't answer, just listen.
You were on an undercover mission
to Tilonus Four... something
happened... we've been told that
you killed someone. But we don't
believe that's true...
We've been in orbit, trying to
find a way to get you out. But
there's a security field around
the hospital that we can't
penetrate...
We've been blocked at every turn.
The hospital Administrator denies
you're here at all. It's
beginning to look like some kind
of a conspiracy...
I had to come in posing as a
health official...
Sit tight. We're going to get you
out of here.
Not real...
Commander.
Get away from me...
Commander, you must come with us.
You are in danger here...
No.
Silence...
Commander, are you --
Help me! HELP ME!
Who are you?
Take them to Security Ward.
Worf to Enterprise -- the pattern
enhancer has been activated.
Three to beam up.
Acknowledged.
There's damage to his parietal
lobe. It's as if someone was
trying to access his long term
memory...
He's still in a state of severe
neural shock. It'll take him a
while to recover...
Number One... do you remember what
happened?
You were abducted during your
mission to Tilonus Four. You were
taken to a psychiatric hospital...
My head... why is it still
bleeding?
It's minor. Nothing to worry
about...
We've done some checking on the
hospital Administrator...
... Mister Suna...
That's right. It appears he's
involved with one of the rival
factions. We believe he was
responsible for what happened to
you...
It still hurts...
It's bleeding again...
But how? You just healed it...
Wil, try to calm down...
This isn't real...
Wil, what are you doing?
If I'm right, you're not really
here... and this isn't a real
phaser...
It's all a fantasy, and I'm ending
it no matter what it takes...
But what if this isn't a fantasy?
Are you willing to take that
chance?
You're right... I won't. But I've
got to find out what's real and
what's not...
One way or another, this is going
to end.
Wil, don't -- !
How's he progressing?
He's not responding to the
Reflection Therapy. His delusions
are growing more elaborate...
He broke out of his cell last
night. We found him running down
a corridor... claiming people had
come to take him back to his
"starship."
Then I see no other choice...
We'll have to perform the synaptic
reconstruction.
I still have the phaser... why do
I still have the phaser?
It's not a phaser. It's a knife.
You stole it from one of the food
trays.
Give it to me. We don't want you
to hurt yourself...
I don't believe you --
If this is a knife... what
happened to Mavek?
It's very complicated. I'll
answer all of your questions. But
first I want you to put it down...
No. If I'm really holding a
phaser, then that means I was on
the Enterprise...
But I fired this at myself on the
Enterprise. I should be dead
right now...
None of this is real --
I'm setting this to Level Sixteen,
wide field. That should destroy
half of this building...
Unless, of course, it isn't a real
phaser.
It's all about you, isn't it?
You're the only constant... the
only person in both places...
There's a lot more going on here
than you realize.
None of this is real, either...
What's happening to me?
We can still save you -- but you
must stop fighting us.
You're lying...
Let me help you...
No!
I'm warning you...
No!
He's conscious!
We haven't finished the neuro
chemical drain -- get him sedated!
Riker to Enterprise!
Enterprise here. Are you alright,
sir?
Emergency transport -- get me out
of here!
Captain's Log, Stardate 46778.1.
Commander Riker has returned
safely from his mission to Tilonus
Four, where he was being held
captive by one of the rival
factions. Doctor Crusher has
repaired the damage to his long
term memory. His recovery is
proceeding well.
Evidently, you were abducted two
days after beaming to the surface.
I remember it now... I was in an
alley... they attacked me from
behind. I tried to defend myself
with the nisroh knife Worf gave
me...
I managed to fight off one of
them... but I think they injected
me with some kind of drug...
We believe they were trying to
extract strategic information from
your memory using a neuro-somatic
technique.
I was in a hospital... then on the
Enterprise... and the hospital
again...
I kept shifting back and forth...
I couldn't tell what was real...
Your mind must have created a
defense mechanism, a fantasy that
helped you resist the neuro-somatic
process. Your unconscious
fastened onto elements from your
real life in an attempt to keep
you grounded... to keep you sane.
The preparation for the mission...
the play... they were all recent
experiences, fresh in my mind...
Get some rest, Number One. We can
talk more in the morning.
Alright... but there's one thing
I'd like to do first...
Are you sure you want to do this
by yourself? The stage crew and
I were going to wait until
morning...
I'm positive. After what I've
experienced... I don't think I
could sleep knowing this was still
up...
