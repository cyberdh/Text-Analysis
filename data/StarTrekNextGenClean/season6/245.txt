			Good evening, Mister Data.
			Actually, good morning, sir.
			Ship status is --
			No need to report. I'm just here
			to do some work of my own.
			Yes, sir.
			I'd like to talk to Doctor Mowray
			at his archaeological site on
			Landris Two. Please put it
			through to my Ready Room.
			I am sorry, sir, but Stellar
			Cartography has requested a
			communications blackout while they
			run an experiment.
			How long will it be?
			Another three hours, twenty-two
			minutes.
			I can override it if necessary.
			No, no... it's not important.
			Aye, sir.
			Computer, display the latest
			excavation schematics from Landris
			Two.
			Library computer is temporarily
			off-line.
			Explain.
			Library Systems have been
			allocated to Stellar Cartography.
			Tea, Earl Grey. Hot.
			Replicator systems are off-line at
			the request of --
			Stellar Cartography...
			What could they possibly be doing
			down there... ?
			In or out, but close that door.
			Just try to stand still.
			It'll take a second for our eyes
			to re-adjust...
			Elevate to three-point-two.
			Good... we can do this...
			We're losing vertical alignment.
			Compensate...
			Gently, don't bump it.
			No, no -- hit the...
			Forget it. Lights.
			Whoever you are, you just ruined
			four hours of work.
			You might've taken the simple
			precaution of locking the door.
			It's three o'clock in the morning --
			Captain Picard...
			You must be Lieutenant Commander
			Daren.
			Yes, sir. I'm sorry. It's just
			we weren't expecting many people
			to be up at this hour.
			You're new aboard the Enterprise.
			I think you'll soon learn to start
			expecting the unexpected.
			That's why I put in for this
			assignment.
			Excellent. Now perhaps you could
			tell me what was so important that
			it required depriving the ship's
			Captain of a cup of Earl Grey?
			Earl Grey? No wonder you can't
			sleep.
			Computer, bring replicators back
			on line and give me a cup of Daren
			herbal tea blend number three,
			hot.
			You shouldn't be drinking a
			stimulant at this time of night.
			I think you'll like this.
			I've programmed seven other blends
			into the replicator...
			You're bound to like one of them.
			I look forward to sampling them.
			I'm sorry if the system blackouts
			we requested inconvenienced you.
			We were taking very precise
			gravimetric readings -- it
			wouldn't have taken much to throw
			them off.
			What are these readings for?
			I'm trying to construct a
			mathematical model of an emerging
			star system. If it works, we'll
			be able to predict the
			configuration of a system that
			won't be formed for another two
			million years.
			That's a long time to wait to find
			out if you're right.
			I have a few things to do between
			now and then.
			We'll arrive at the Borgolis
			Nebula in three hours, sir.
			I understand it has unusual
			radioactive emissions -- I'm sure
			Stellar Sciences will find it an
			interesting study.
			Commander Daren has already
			requested time on the main sensor
			array.
			You have the Bridge, Number One.
			Captain, I would like to remind
			you about our concert this evening
			in Ten-Forward.
			We will be performing Chopin's
			Trio in G minor.
			I'll be there.
			... the upshot is... we'll be close
			enough for you to slip away for a
			few days and see Wesley.
			Wonderful, thank you, Jean-Luc.
			This is delicious; what is it?
			It's an herbal tea blend...
			I came across it in the replicator
			files.
			Have you met any of the new
			crewmembers we took on at Starbase
			Two-eighteen?
			In fact, I have a new Nurse. His
			name's Beck, he's an obstetrics
			specialist.
			I met the new head of Stellar
			Sciences last night. Lieutenant
			Commander Daren.
			Yes... Nella Daren. She was in
			Sickbay for a physical last week.
			I liked her. Very forthright.
			Very.
			Oh, I forgot to tell you... The
			Exogenics Journal accepted my
			paper for publication.
			That's wonderful, Beverly.
			I'm hoping to get a response from
			other scientists studying
			ribosomal replication. There's
			still no satisfying explanation
			for the genetic drift.
			That journal is widely read.
			You'll probably be swamped with
			responses.
			Did you know it's possible now to
			predict the configuration of a
			star system that won't be formed
			for another two million years?
			Really? No, I didn't...
			It's quite intriguing. It's made
			possible by a rather complex
			mathematical construct based on
			fractal particle motion. And of
			course that's just the
			foundation... the modeling itself
			requires gravimetric wave inputs.
			I see.
			Well, I'm sure it sounds dry.
			Stellar cartography isn't
			everyone's cup of tea...
			I'm sure it's fascinating.
			Well... we'd better get to Ten
			Forward; we don't want to be late
			for the concert.
			Your playing was remarkable.
			Thank you, sir.
			You're very talented.
			I noticed that the applause
			tonight exceeded average decibel
			levels.
			I guess that means they enjoyed
			themselves. I know I enjoyed
			playing.
			That was obvious.
			Excuse me. I have not yet
			congratulated Ensign Cheney.
			I'll go with you.
			I played piano for a while when I
			was young. But I never put in the
			practice time it takes to become
			truly proficient.
			That was never my problem. In
			fact, my parents had to make me go
			out and play.
			I wanted to ask you... during the
			second arpeggio in the first
			movement, I noticed you played an
			F minor chord instead of a
			diminished D.
			You're a musician. What's your
			instrument? We should play some
			time.
			I'm very much an amateur. But I
			must say, your choice in that
			arpeggio was delightful. Not at
			all what one expects to hear.
			Well, Captain... now that I'm on
			your ship, maybe you should start
			expecting the unexpected.
			Excuse me, sir.
			I was hoping my people in Spectral
			Analysis could have another few
			hours on the main sensor array.
			I'm sorry, the array's been
			allocated to Engineering; they're
			running some warp field tests.
			If we go off-line now, we'll lose
			the gas flow pattern we've been
			tracking.
			I understand that. But we've got
			other departments waiting to use
			the array.
			We're at a critical juncture --
			Commander.
			I'll see what I can do about more
			time tomorrow.
			Tomorrow... but ---
			Thank you, sir.
			End playback.
			Come.
			Commander Daren.
			I hope you don't mind me dropping
			by like this?
			I'm delighted. Come in.
			What kind of flute is that?
			It's Ressikan.
			I never saw one before.
			They're not made anymore.
			How long have you been playing?
			A long time...
			I'd love to hear you play
			sometime.
			I'm not very good.
			It doesn't matter, as long as you
			enjoy it.
			Yes, but I wouldn't want to
			inflict it on anyone else.
			May I try?
			You're not holding it quite
			right...
			Show me.
			You're better than you think.
			Please...
			Really. We should play together.
			There's... no piano here.
			Oh, but there is.
			I picked it up on Mataline Two.
			It's amazing.
			Remarkable...
			Why don't you play something for
			me?
			You start... I'll jump in.
			What... shall we play?
			What were you working on before I
			came in?
			Bach... the third Brandenburg.
			Perfect. Go ahead.
			Sorry...
			It's all right... you're not used
			to playing with anyone, are you?
			Just the computer.
			Well... I may not be as precise as
			a computer... but I think you'll
			enjoy it more.
			Let's try something a little
			simpler. How about...
			Very good! Now... let's have a
			little fun with it.
			Try it. Improvise on the melody --
			anything you want.
			That's wonderful! Keep going...
			Number One... my sparring partner
			cancelled for this afternoon. I
			was wondering if you wanted to
			join me?
			Fencing, sir? I'm really not very
			good.
			It doesn't matter... as long as
			you enjoy it.
			Why not?
			Excellent. Fourteen hundred
			hours, then.
			You have a mild strain.
			I've been playing the piano a
			lot... I guess the Captain and I
			overdid it a little last night.
			The Captain?
			He plays a kind of flute...
			Ressikan, I think he said.
			Yes... but I didn't realize he
			played... duets.
			He never did before. But he
			seemed to enjoy it. He's actually
			quite promising.
			I see.
			Tell me... have you known him
			long?
			Yes. A long time...
			He seems... somewhat isolated.
			I'd say he's a private person...
			but not isolated.
			There. That should help.
			It feels much better. Thank you.
			Good.
			I was afraid I'd have to cancel.
			Another duet?
			Where are we going?
			Keep climbing.
			I don't see why we can't just
			practice in my quarters.
			We're almost there.
			Do you know where we are?
			The fourth intersect of Jefferies
			Tube twenty-five.
			No... this is the most
			acoustically perfect spot on the
			ship.
			The intersection acts as a
			resonance chamber.
			How did you find it?
			A little exploring.
			Don't tell me you climbed through
			every tube on the ship?
			Well, not every one.
			Try it. See how it sounds.
			That's beautiful. What is it?
			Just an old folk melody.
			I've never heard you play with
			such feeling.
			Geordi. Is there a problem?
			I hear music.
			Music?
			I do not hear anything.
			Are you sure?
			I know I heard something.
			It's stopped.
			... I'd heard about Kerelian
			tenors all my life, but nothing
			could've prepared me for that
			man's voice. Soaring...
			incredible range.
			I'm told there are nuances only
			Kerelians can hear -- we don't
			have the ears for it.
			I should be finished with my
			survey by eleven hundred hours.
			Very good, Commander.
			Commander, we've finished the warp
			field test.
			You brought it in ahead of
			schedule.
			No problem. We got modulation
			efficiency up point five percent.
			Good work.
			Notify Spectral Analysis they can
			have an hour on the main sensor
			array.
			Captain...
			The Federation Outpost on
			Bersallis Three reports that they
			are entering a period of fire
			storm activity.
			Is the outpost in any danger?
			No, sir. The storm is heading for
			the northern continent, which is
			not populated.
			Bersallin fire storms come in
			seven year cycles -- this might be
			a good chance to study them.
			We have two days before our
			rendezvous with the Havana...
			Helm, set course for Bersallis
			Three. Warp five.
			Counselor, would you join me in my
			Ready Room?
			You have the Bridge, Number One.
			I wanted to talk to you about a
			matter of... protocol.
			I know there are no Starfleet
			regulations about a Captain
			becoming involved with a fellow
			officer, but...
			You'd like my opinion about you
			and Commander Daren.
			It's that obvious?
			Obvious in way that pleases people
			who care about your happiness?
			Yes, it is.
			But I have to be concerned about
			more than my own happiness.
			And you think that perhaps your
			feelings toward Nella could change
			the way you function as Captain...
			Yes. Relationships with coworkers
			can be fraught with
			consequences.
			That's true. But cutting yourself
			off from your feelings can carry
			consequences that are just as
			important.
			I've always believed that becoming
			involved with someone under my
			command could compromise my
			objectivity.
			And yet...
			Captain... are you asking my
			permission?
			If I were... would you give it?
			Yes.
			Come in.
			Nella...
			Can I help you, sir?
			I'm sorry about what happened this
			morning in the Turbolift.
			When that crewman walked in I
			felt... self-conscious. It might
			take me a while to get used to the
			idea of the crew seeing us
			together.
			I understand...
			I'm glad you told me. For a
			minute there I thought I'd misread
			you...
			One kiss and you're off to find
			someone else.
			I promise you... I'm not one for
			casual relationships.
			There's something I want to tell
			you...
			But not here...
			Do you remember that folk melody
			I played for you this morning?
			I learned it on a planet called
			Kataan.
			Never heard of it.
			I'm not surprised. Its sun went
			nova over a thousand years ago.
			I don't understand.
			The Enterprise encountered a probe
			sent from the planet before it was
			destroyed. The probe scanned me --
			I lost consciousness, and in the
			space of twenty-five minutes... I
			lived a lifetime there.
			I had a wife... children.
			It was all very real to me.
			When I awoke, all that was left of
			my life there... was the flute I'd
			taught myself to play.
			Why are you telling me all this?
			Because I want you to understand
			what my music means to me.
			And what it means for me to be
			able to share it with someone.
			Thank you.
			Commander --
			I was hoping to talk to you about
			Ensign Cabot's transfer.
			Quantum Mechanics didn't want to
			give him up.
			But he wants to come to my
			department.
			How do you know that?
			I offered it to him.
			Transfers have to be cleared
			through me -- before an offer's
			made.
			I'm sorry. We were just talking
			and --
			It's okay. But Fontana should
			stay where he is.
			Commander, please... don't make
			that decision final.
			I realize I shouldn't have made
			the offer, but he's perfect for
			the job. And quantum mechanics is
			over-staffed anyway.
			Commander... do you realize the
			position you're putting me in?
			I think I'm just doing what any
			good department head would do --
			trying to build the best staff I
			can.
			Look... I'll review the situation
			and let you know as soon as I can.
			Come.
			Can I have a minute?
			Of course. Come in.
			It's about Lieutenant Commander
			Daren...
			As a department head, she comes to
			me about systems allocation,
			personnel transfers -- things like
			that.
			I have to say, I'm beginning to
			feel... uncomfortable dealing with
			her requests.
			Because of her relationship with
			me.
			Yes.
			Number One... are her requests
			unusual?
			No, sir.
			Would you say she's just trying to
			do her job?
			Yes.
			Then let her.
			And feel free to do yours.
			Ship's resources are your
			responsibility. I've always had
			complete confidence in your
			judgment.
			Thank you, sir.
			... I can't believe I'm going to
			get a chance to study the fire
			storms on Bersallis. Did you know
			they're generated by solar flare
			activity? Apparently the
			radiation --
			I'm boring you.
			It's not that.
			Commander Riker came to talk to me
			this afternoon.
			About you.
			About the personnel transfer?
			I thought he felt uncomfortable.
			Did he think I was asking for
			special treatment?
			I was just doing what I thought
			was best for my department.
			That's what I told him. But we
			have to be very careful.
			Obviously it's easy for people to
			misunderstand.
			I don't like the thought of having
			to second-guess people all the
			time. If I have to worry about
			what people are thinking about me,
			I'll be concentrating on the wrong
			thing. And I won't be as
			effective an officer.
			All I'm saying is that it's
			something we have to be aware of.
			But don't compromise yourself, do
			what you have to do.
			Because if I find out that the
			head of Stellar Sciences isn't
			effective anymore, I'll do what I
			have to do...
			I'll replace her.
			Noted, sir.
			I suggest we forget about this and
			enjoy the evening.
			What about that dessert you
			promised me?
			Ah, yes.
			A concoction I first sampled on
			Thelka Four...
			Bridge to Captain. Bersallis
			Three reports that the storm has
			changed its speed and heading.
			They are predicting it will hit
			the outpost within eight hours and
			are requesting evacuation.
			On my way.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46693.1.
			We have entered the Bersallis star
			system and are making preparations
			to evacuate the Federation Outpost
			on the third planet.
			The fire storms can kick up winds
			of over two hundred kilometers per
			hour -- and temperatures as high
			as three hundred degrees C.
			Incredible... what causes them?
			They form when solar flare
			radiation from the Bersallin sun
			reacts with high energy plasma
			present in the planet's
			atmosphere.
			Wasn't the outpost built to
			withstand the conditions?
			Yes; the structure is reinforced
			and insulated. But this is no
			ordinary storm; it's twice as big
			as any they've ever had. The
			outpost won't withstand it.
			We'll be arriving a little over an
			hour before the storm hits.
			It'll take at least two hours to
			transport all the colonists off
			the surface.
			I led a team of geologists to
			study the plasma geyser on Taurus
			Four -- we cross-connected a few
			thermal deflector units to create
			a protective shield against the
			heat.
			A fire wall...
			Could something like that work
			here?
			It might.
			The storm is approaching the
			outpost from this direction.
			If we set up a series of thermal
			deflector units along the northern
			perimeter, we could create a fire
			wall to deflect some of the heat --
			the outpost's insulation could
			probably handle the rest.
			Thermal deflectors generate a
			field approximately four hundred
			meters wide. We would need to
			cross-connect six units and align
			them so their fields overlap.
			How many people would it take to
			set it up?
			Twelve, two per team. Cross-connecting
			that many units will be
			tricky; once they're set up we'll
			have to leave them in place and
			transport our people out -- no one
			could survive very long outside
			the outpost.
			Let's do it.
			The storm's going to interfere
			with communications --
			everything'll have to be
			coordinated from the surface.
			Mister Data, you'll coordinate the
			evacuation of the colonists.
			Doctor, they have nine patients in
			the outpost infirmary. Your
			priority will be getting them to
			Sickbay -- after that you'll stay
			aboard the Enterprise and be ready
			to receive casualties.
			Marquez, you'll take some people
			down to track the storm -- you'll
			need to keep all teams apprised of
			its heading.
			Commander, you'll coordinate the
			deployment of the deflectors.
			Let's go.
			Commander Daren... ?
			About these thermal deflectors...
			It seems to me that any one of a
			number of people could coordinate
			their deployment.
			I assume Commander Riker chose me
			because I'm the best person for
			the job.
			Didn't we agree not to let our
			relationship get in the way of our
			work?
			I'll be all right.
			Lieutenant Marquez is already set
			up on the surface. Apparently the
			storm is still gaining speed --
			he's estimating it'll hit the
			colony in less than fifty minutes.
			Energize.
			How long before the storm reaches
			the outpost?
			Seventeen minutes.
			LaForge to Bridge.
			Go ahead.
			The ionization from the storm is
			interfering with the transporters.
			I'm compensating, but it's slowing
			things down.
			Keep at it, Mister LaForge.
			Riker to Daren.
			Daren, here. Go ahead, Commander.
			You've got less than nine minutes
			before the storm reaches the
			northern perimeter.
			I'm with team six right now, sir.
			We're about to bring the
			deflectors on-line.
			Whenever you're ready.
			Daren to perimeter teams. Stand
			by to cross-connect deflectors...
			Activate.
			Team three, increase your output
			by point two percent.
			Good...
			Deng, decrease nutation by point
			four percent.
			Good... we've almost got it.
			Crusher to Bridge.
			Go ahead, Doctor.
			I've just brought aboard the last
			of the infirmary patients and
			they're on their way to Sickbay.
			But we still have over a hundred
			colonists down there.
			Understood, Doctor.
			Daren to Commander Riker.
			Riker, here. Go ahead.
			We've got a problem --
			... we're having trouble keeping
			the deflectors cross-connected.
			The only way this is going to work
			is if we calibrate them manually.
			If you stay with the deflectors,
			will they protect you when the
			storm hits?
			I don't know, sir. For a few
			minutes... maybe.
			Number One, how many colonists are
			left to transport?
			Seventy three, sir.
			How long do you need?
			At least ten more minutes.
			Captain, the storm will reach the
			northern perimeter in four
			minutes.
			Picard to perimeter teams.
			... It is imperative that you hold
			your positions until we finish the
			evacuation of the colony. Picard
			out.
			Picard to LaForge.
			LaForge here.
			Keep a signal lock on all
			perimeter team members.
			Captain, the storm's interference
			won't --
			As soon as the last of the
			colonists are evacuated I want
			those perimeter teams out of
			there. Is that understood?
			Yes, sir.
			Daren to perimeter teams... the
			storm's interference is going to
			make our job harder than we
			thought. We may lose
			communication, so it's up to each
			of you to keep your units
			operational.
			A lot of people are depending on
			us. Daren, out.
			Oh, my god.
			The storm has reached the
			perimeter.
			I got out with the last of the
			colonists. If it hadn't been for
			the perimeter teams, we wouldn't
			have made it.
			We managed to get four of the
			teams off the surface.
			The interference kept us from
			getting the other two... I don't
			see how they could have survived.
			Which teams are missing?
			Three and six.
			The last I knew, Commander Daren
			was with team six.
			Bridge to Captain.
			Go ahead, Mister Worf.
			We've found survivors, sir..
			They're beaming up now.
			On my way.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46697.2.
			Although we succeeded in rescuing
			all six hundred forty-three
			Bersallin colonists... we lost
			eight crewmembers. Let the record
			show that they gave their lives in
			the performance of their duty.
			Commendations will follow.
			... when communications went out,
			I knew we had to fend for
			ourselves.
			We modified our phasers to create
			resonant disruptions in the
			deflector field... the disruptions
			formed small pockets inside the
			plane of the field... and we each
			stood inside one to wait out the
			storm.
			Richardson didn't make it... all
			Deng and I could do was stand
			there... and watch.
			Nella... you know I had to give
			that order --
			Don't... don't say you're sorry.
			It couldn't have been easy for
			you... hearing me order you to
			face death.
			At first, when I heard you tell us
			to hold our positions, I didn't
			question it. Of course we
			would... that was our job.
			But when I saw that storm coming
			toward us...
			Part of you must have... blamed
			me.
			A small part, maybe... But in the
			end, I was more afraid that you
			would blame yourself if I died.
			Would you have?
			I've lost people under my
			command... people I cared about
			deeply... but never someone I've
			been in love with.
			When I thought you were dead, I
			went into some kind of shutdown...
			I didn't want to think, I didn't
			want to feel. I was here, in my
			quarters, and... the only thing I
			could focus on was music... and
			how it would never give me joy
			again.
			Well... where do we go from here?
			We could continue... hoping we
			wouldn't face a situation like
			that again... knowing that we
			might... hoping the pressures on
			us wouldn't begin to erode our
			feelings for each other...
			That's not what I want for us.
			I know. Neither do I.
			I don't think we can serve on the
			same ship.
			It would be difficult... for both
			of us.
			I'll put in for a transfer.
			We can arrange shore leave
			together.
			Yes, of course.
			Promise me something?
			Don't give up your music.
