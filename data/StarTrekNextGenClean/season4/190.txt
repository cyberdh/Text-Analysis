Captain's Log, Stardate 44614.6:
We are approaching Starbase
Three-One-Three, where we will
pick up a shipment of scientific
equipment for a Federation outpost
in the Guernica System. At the
same time --
-- we will be hosting a special
guest.
You wanted to see me, Captain?
Yes, Mister LaForge. It seems
that the exemplary nature of your
work has caught the attention of
Starfleet Command.
Well... that's very flattering.
Thank you, sir.
In fact, someone is coming on
board just to see some of the
engine modifications you have
made.
Who's that, Captain?
The Senior Design Engineer of the
Theoretical Propulsion Group --
Doctor Leah Brahms.
Leah's coming here? That's
terrific!
You know Doctor Brahms?
Well, of course I do! I --
I mean, I've studied her -- her
schematics for years. She was
responsible for a lot of the
engine design on the Enterprise.
Well, it should be an enjoyable
visit, then. She'll be
transporting on board as soon as
we arrive at the Starbase. Would
you like to greet her on our
behalf?
Why... yes, Captain. I'd be happy
to serve that function.
You're gonna wear that uniform
out if you keep swatting at it...
I guess I'm a little nervous...
it's not every day a man comes
face to face with a dream...
Remember... about a year ago...
when we were caught in that
booby-trap the Menthars set?
Yes...
While we were trying to get out
of it, I went to the holodeck to
study an engine prototype that
was built when the Enterprise was
first designed...
Uh-huh...
And the computer... well, it gave
me an image of the engine... but
it also created a hologram of the
designer. Doctor Leah Brahms.
So... you met a computer-simulated
female...
But what a computer-simulated
female... She was brilliant, of
course... but warm, friendly...
We worked like one person... what
I didn't think of, she did... I'd
start sentences, she'd finish
them. It was just so --
comfortable...
Okay, I know it was just a
holographic image... but the
computer was able to incorporate
personality traits from her
Starfleet record.
We all fall in love with our
fantasies, from time to time,
LaForge...
You've got it wrong, Guinan. I'm
not necessarily expecting anything
romantic. I just know that,
whatever else, Leah Brahms and
I will be good friends.
Doctor Brahms is ready to
transport, sir.
Okay. Bring her over.
Hi!
I mean... welcome aboard, Doctor
Brahms. I'm Lieutenant Commander
Geordi LaForge. Chief Engineer.
LaForge. So you're the one who's
fouled up my engine design.
... the matter/anti-matter ratio
has been changed... the mixture
isn't as rich as regulations
dictate.
Experience has shown me that too
high a ratio diminishes
efficiency. I worked with the
mixture until I got the right
balance.
The magnetic plasma transfer to
the warp field generators doesn't
correspond to the recommended
specs.
Right. Again, I adjusted the
flow... sometimes in space things
work a little differently than
they do on the drawing board.
Is that a criticism, Commander?
No, of course not. It's just...
a well-known fact. There's
theory... and there's
application. They don't always
jibe.
You've charted a completely new
swap-out schedule for main
component replacement...
You bet. I found the Starfleet
estimates of MTBF units were
unrealistic. I determined my own
schedule based on observation and
experience.
Is that going to be your only
defense, Commander? That same
tired rhetoric...
"Out here in the field we learn
things you designers couldn't
possibly understand... "
In the first place, Doctor, I'm
not aware of needing any
defense... in the second place
--
Doctor Brahms... you have an
incoming message on subspace...
I'd like to hear this message
privately.
In my office. Be my guest.
Commander, I am picking up some
unusual readings from the Alpha
Omicron system.
At this range, all I can discern
is that it is an asymmetrical
field of intense energy.
What type of radiation
signature?
Unknown, sir.
Commander, the Alpha Omicron
system has not yet been charted.
I recommend that we take this
opportunity for further research.
We're way ahead of schedule...
Alter course for Alpha Omicron.
The anomaly is orbiting the
seventh planet. It is a mass of
plasma energy contained within
discrete boundaries by an outer
covering of silicates, actinides,
and carbonaceaous chondrites.
On screen.
Magnify.
Is it a ship?
It does not conform to any known
design.
Any records of similar phenomena
in Starfleet listings?
None, sir. This has never been
seen before.
Ensign Rager, ahead one quarter
impulse. Bring us into orbit
around the seventh planet.
Maintain a relative distance of
ten kilometers from the object.
Alert all science labs to standby.
They should be coordinating their
efforts with Commander Data.
Aye, sir.
Doctor Brahms... there's no reason
for us to argue... we're both on
the same side, here...
I'm aware of that...
So, why don't I take you on a
little tour... show you the
adjustments I've made... why I
think they work... and... we can
start pulling together on this.
Okay... for instance, here in the
dilithium chamber...
What happened here? Who did this?
You remember, the crystal's been
reoriented to adjust the direction
of the lattice structure.
Remember? Why would I remember?
Right, why would you? The ship
was having some difficulties, so
we made the modification. Hoping
it would work. And... it did.
So it was your idea?
Well, not exclusively...
It's curious... this modification
was actually due to be
introduced...
... in the next class starship.
Yes... how did you know?
I didn't... It was the next
logical step.
Doctor, sometimes we have to
fly by the seat of our pants
out here... and it stands to
reason that now and then we're
gonna come up with the same
solutions you do...
Listen. I've got a personnel
review scheduled to start in about
five minutes, and it's been a long
day for you. How about we...
we get together later. Sort of...
plan our agenda for the next day
or two.
Agenda?
What it is we want to
accomplish... the best way to
go about it... and -- get to know
each other. It might make things
easier.
Maybe you're right...
Okay -- nineteen hundred hours...
my quarters. Maybe we'll even
have a bite to eat... I make great
fungilli.
I love fungilli.
Is that right... ?
Sensors are having difficulty
penetrating the interior.
However, the pattern of radiated
output suggests a coherent system
of energy storage and
utilization.
Then it was constructed by
someone?
It is a possibility, sir.
However, sensor data gathered thus
far suggests this is a naturally
occurring phenomenon with
biological properties.
A lifeform?
Yes, Captain.
"Asked the child of the stranger
without any name... whither you
go... and whence you came?"
"To the child's delight the answer
came clear... To the end I go for
it all starts here."
It seems we were bread and
buttered on the same nursery
rhymes, Mister Worf.
Mister Data, prepare three class
five probes for launch. Mister
Worf, begin compiling readings
for transmission to Starfleet
Headquarters.
Ensign... aft thrusters. Standard
observation posture.
What would it be like,
Counselor... no ship, no bulky
spacesuit... just to live between
the stars... and know that the
entire galaxy was your home... ?
We are being probed. Recommend
we raise shields, sir...
Negative. If we're curious about
it, it has a right to be curious
about us...
Counselor, is this "curiosity"
motivated by instinct or
intelligence?
It's impossible to tell, Captain.
Change in readings, Captain. The
lifeform has increased its energy
output by fifty percent.
It is moving toward us, sir!
Reverse course, Ensign, easily...
three hundred k.p.h. Nothing to
alarm or provoke it...
Aye, sir...
We are being held, in an energy
damping field, sir.
Raise shields.
No effect, Captain.
Reverse power, full impulse.
Impulse engines at full power.
No change in our position.
Red Alert!
Commander LaForge, prepare to
initiate the warp drive.
Sorry, Captain... there's too much
inteference to form a warp field.
Warning. Radiation levels at
sixty-five millirads per minute
and rising.
Riker to Doctor Crusher.
Go ahead, Commander.
All decks are to begin radiation
protocol.
Acknowledged. Crusher out.
Warning. Radiation levels at
three hundred millirads per minute
and rising. Lethal exposure in
one minute.
Mister Worf... ready main
phasers... minimum power.
Ready.
Fire.
Radiation levels dropping back
to normal, Captain.
The energy patterns are breaking
down... the lifeform's radiation
signature is no longer stable.
Energy output is negligible...
radiation patterns are no longer
coherent.
I believe it is dead, sir.
We are out here to explore, to
make contact with other lifeforms,
to establish peaceful relations,
but not to interfere and
absolutely not to destroy. And
yet look what we have just done
-- what I have just done.
Captain, everything you did was
consistent with established
Starfleet procedures... what
happened was an accident...
unavoidable...
The Bridge is yours, Number One.
Captain, sensors are picking up
a new energy reading from the
lifeform.
Elaborate, Mister Data...
There is a new concentration of
ionizing radiation growing in the
center of its body.
Then -- perhaps it's still
alive...
Computer... subdued lighting.
No, no, too much. I just want
it -- nice. You know. Cozy.
Please state your request in
precise candlepower.
It's not a matter of precision,
it's a matter of... mood.
Brighter than this.
More... more... a little more --
there! That's perfect. Now,
music... maybe a little soft
jazz...
No... not right... maybe -- oh,
I got it! Of course -- Brahms!
A piano etude...
No, that's corny. Probably
everybody tries that...
computer... how about... guitar.
Classical guitar. Anybody.
Come on in!
Oh, you changed...
Well, you know the uniform is
so... formal...
You're less formal than any
Starfleet officer I've ever met,
Lieutenant.
Am I? I just wanted to make
you... feel more comfortable.
I'm fine. Thank you.
You know... your hair is
different...
Different than a few hours ago?
No, no... I mean... different
than... I expected. From your
Starfleet records...
Oh. Yes... I used to wear it
up...
Why would you need to see my
personnel file... ?
It's just... standard procedure
for guests coming aboard...
protocol.
Nothing specific... actually.
Please. Sit down. Would you like
anything to drink?
No, thank you.
Commander LaForge... if I seem
to you somewhat... unyielding...
in my views -- it's because I care
so very much about my work.
I know that.
Well, to be honest, some people
find me cold, cerebral, lacking
in humor...
I'm sure they're wrong.
Well, I... try... not to be that
way. But when it comes to my
designs, to my engines...
especially the ones on the
Enterprise...
... they're like your children.
Yes... exactly...
So naturally you're a little
possessive about them.
You -- understand that?
Sure. I feel a little like that
myself.
That's amazing. I don't think
anyone has ever...
Sometimes I'm more comfortable
with engine schematics than with
people.
Maybe you just haven't met the
right people.
I'm starving... why don't we have
some dinner.
Commander --
Please. Call me Geordi.
I'm sorry, I hope you didn't
go to a lot of trouble, but I
can't stay.
You can't --?
I just don't feel it's
appropriate.
I'll meet you at oh-eight-hundred
tomorrow. I'm preparing a list
of the discrepancies I've
identified in your modifications.
I hope -- now that we've reached
an understanding -- that you'll
be prepared to discuss them with
me in a more objective fashion.
Well, sure...
Thank you. Good night, Commander.
Computer -- turn up the damn
lights. And get rid of that
stupid guitar.
This new concentration of energy
was detected only after the
surrounding material became
inert.
Could this be some sort of...
tissue regeneration?
The radiation signature is similar
to the original pattern, but there
are significant differences.
Some kind of reaction to our
phaser fire, perhaps...
I believe this is separate and
self-contained within the body
of the dead lifeform.
Another entity... ?
Yessir. It appears to be a
smaller, less developed version
of the original creature.
No wonder it attacked us. It
was about to give birth.
It's dangerous to generalize about
new lifeforms... but based on my
experience with other beings that
bear their young in this manner,
I'd say the offspring is still
premature. Otherwise, it would
be able to break through the outer
body shell of the parent.
Will this... child be able to
survive on its own without the
parent?
There's no way to tell. We don't
have enough information about the
bio-functions of the adult, much
less the child.
Is there something we can do to
help?
If we were in Sickbay, I'd try
a Cesarean section... the first
priority is to free it from the
parent's body.
We could use our phasers like a
scalpel...
Yes... that might work...
I advise against this, Captain.
The parent proved to be a threat
to the ship... we do not know how
the offspring will react.
Your objection is noted... but
we are directly responsible for
the death of the parent. We
cannot simply walk away now.
We'll proceed at your discretion,
Doctor.
Good morning!
Morning.
The first thing I'd like to do
is inspect the power transfer
conduits.
You realize the only way to
inspect them is to crawl inside...
I designed them, Commander... I
know what's involved.
Watch out for the power taps.
The acoustic signature doesn't
sound right.
You're probably the only other
person in the galaxy who could
pick that up.
What's causing it?
It's right up here.
I've never seen anything like
this... what is it?
A mid-range phase adjuster... it
puts the plasma back into phase
after inertial distortion.
This has never been done before.
I don't think it's ever been
conceived of before. You should
write a scientific paper.
That's not my strong suit,
Doctor...
But this kind of refinement should
be shared... and you deserve the
credit for it...
Maybe we could collaborate.
Writing is one of your strong
points.
Commander LaForge... ever since
I came on board, there's been
something a little peculiar in
your attitude. You seem to know
things about me even though we've
never met.
I... studied you. Your writings,
your Starfleet file. I've admired
you. Your work.
I'm flattered, but...
I've looked forward to meeting
you for a long time...
And I'd like to think -- that we
could get to be friends. Good
friends.
I thought you knew... you seem
to know everything else about
me... but Commander... if I'm
hearing what I think I am, then
you should know... I'm married.
Set phaser power to three percent,
narrow beam.
Three percent.
All right... here we go.
First incision is complete.
Ideally, the offspring should be
able to push through the outer
shell on its own now.
It needs a little more help.
We've done all we can. I don't
want to risk hitting the child
by accident.
Come on... you can do it...
Captain, I'd like to announce the
birth of a large baby...
something.
Well done, Doctor. Well done.
A glitch, a malfunction in the
holodeck... it's the only
explanation I can think of... it's
a miracle we ever got out of that
booby-trap alive... how could it
have been so far off? It was
based on every piece of
information on record about Leah
Brahms... okay, with an admitted
margin for error... but this is
an error that's a light year
wide...
Not what you hoped for, huh?
Hoped for... ? She's about as
friendly as a Circassian Plague
Cat... all she cares about is her
work... she hates what I've done
to her engines... and to top it
off -- she's married! The
computer never even told me she
was married...
Computer problem, huh...
Must've been...
Maybe it was your old VISOR...
What are you talking about?
The VISOR you wore on the holodeck
with her.
This is the same VISOR.
Really? I figured you were
wearing the one that lets you see
what you want to see.
What's that supposed to mean?
You saw exactly what you wanted
to see in the holodeck... Sure,
the computer made it look like
her, added personality... but
when it came to your relationship
together, you filled in the
blanks...
Here you had this perfectly
wonderful fantasy... and now the
real Leah comes along and ruins
it.
She's done the most heartless,
despicable thing one person can
do to another -- she didn't live
up to your expectations.
Take a hard look through your
VISOR, LaForge... see her for
who she really is... not what you
want her to be.
The lifeform's patterns are
stable, Captain. It seems able
to withstand the solar radiation
without difficulty.
Good.
Ensign Rager, set course for the
Guernica system.
Aye, sir...
We're not staying?
No. We've done what we can to
help... now it's time to move on.
This... child will live the rest
of its life without any further
interference from us.
It might be wise to put some
distance between us before
initiating the warp drive.
Very well.
Five hundred k.p.h., Ensign.
Engage.
Captain, it's following us...
maintaining a distance of four
kilometers directly astern.
Seventeen degrees to port, Ensign
Rager.
Aye, sir.
It's turning with us, sir.
Increase to one half impulse.
It is matching our velocity.
It's imprinted on us.
It thinks the Enterprise is...
its mother.
A change in energy readings, sir.
I am reading an internal buildup
of gamma particles in---
Its velocity is increasing... it's
moving directly toward the ship!
Evasive maneuvers, full...
Report...
Minor damage...
Sir, the creature is now in direct
contact with the hull.
On screen.
Data?
Sir, the lifeform is draining
energy directly from the fusion
reactors.
Feeding off the energy of the
Enterprise as it would from its
mother.
What action should we take,
Captain?
None, Lieutenant. None at all.
Captain's log, supplemental.
Since the newborn has attached
itself to the hull, it has been
making greater and greater demands
on the ship's energy, but we have
been able to temporarily stabilize
our power systems.
How long before the power drain
becomes critical, Mister LaForge?
If it continues to increase at
the current rate, six, seven
hours, maybe...
We may be able to modify the
engines to extend that a little
longer, Captain.
Your help would be appreciated,
Doctor.
By then, maybe Junior won't need
us any more.
Data, is there any way to
determine what the destination
of the parent might have been?
I can attempt to extrapolate from
the heading it was on when we
encountered it, sir.
Perhaps it was on the way to a
safe and supportive environment
for its newborn.
We might be able to deliver it
to the same destination.
Which raises the question of how
to get Junior off the hull when
we get there...
It's almost completely covering
the door of shuttlebay two. If
we open the door and deactivate
the atmospheric force field...
... the pressure from inside the
ship might push it away from the
hull.
Make it so.
Is the appellation "Junior" to
be the lifeform's official name
from now on?
No. It's not.
We can save a lot of energy just
by improving engine efficiency...
We've run into similar problems
before... that's actually why
I reoriented the dilithium
crystal...
And why you added that mid-range
phase adjuster...
Right.
Commander... it seems you've made
more modifications than I'm aware
of. Do you have a file on all
the work you've done?
Sure. It's in the computer --
Picard to LaForge...
LaForge here...
Commander, I need to see you on
the Bridge.
Yes, sir, be right there.
You go ahead, Doctor... Ensign
Pavlik can show you the file on
the engine modifications.
Phase coils upgraded to fifty-five
field densities... plasma inducers
interlinked with generator...
Ensign, would there be any other
files with data on the original
engine specifications?
I believe so, Doctor...
This file utilizes the prototype
engine schematic...
It's a holographic program set
in the drafting room at Utopia
Planitia.
Perfect. I'll run it on
Holodeck Three.
Computer... replay program
Nine-One-Four-Zero... engine
schematic at Utopia Planitia...
Program loaded and ready.
She went where?
Holodeck Three, sir... I didn't
think there was anything wrong
with her seeing the file...
Of course not... nothing at all...
I'm with you every day, Geordi.
Every time you look at this
engine, you're looking at me.
Every time you touch it, it's me.
Computer, freeze program.
Now... I understand...
No, you don't... it wasn't the
way it might look...
I called up a replay of the
program file. I was all ready
to compliment you again,
Commander... for constructing a
program which contained the
prototype engine... so you'd
always have a base-line reference
point for your modifications...
And then I find... it's all about
a -- fantasy plaything...
It's not like that, I swear --
I am outraged by this. I have
been -- invaded. Violated. How
dare you use me like this? How
far did it go, anyway? Was it
good for you?
Nothing like that happened. It
was a professional collaboration.
Oh, I can tell -- "Every time you
touch the engine, it's me... " Real
professional.
If you watched the whole program,
you saw what it was... we worked
together to solve a problem. In
a crisis situation --
How do I know that's all there
was? What other programs did you
create? You could have dozens
of them, one for every day of the
week, one for every mood --
Ever since you came on board,
you've been badgering me... and
I've taken it. I've shown you
courtesy, and respect, and a hell
of a lot of patience. I've tried
to understand you and I've tried
to get along with you...
And in return, you've accused me,
tried and convicted me without
bothering to hear my side of it.
So -- I'm guilty, okay? But not
of what you think... of something
much worse...
I'm guilty of reaching out to
you... of hoping we could
connect... I'm guilty of a
terrible crime, Doctor -- I
offered you friendship.
Its total volume has increased
by eight point five percent in
the last three hours. I am now
reading it as forty-six million
cubic meters. (TECH)
Captain, I have completed the
analysis of the parent's course
through this system.
It was heading for an asteroid
belt...
Ensign Rager, set course two five
nine mark three one eight, one
half impulse.
Aye, sir.
Hold position five hundred
kilometers from the periphery of
the asteroid field...
Aye, sir.
Difficulty getting a clear sensor
reading beyond four thousand
kilometers.
The asteroids contain large
quantities of meklinite, which
is interferring with our scanners.
I am also detecting traces of
Kefnium, a compound which was
found in the parent being's outer
shell. It is likely that the
asteroids provide sustenance for
this lifeform.
We could leave the child here.
If Data's right, it would have
an ample supply of food.
Agreed.
Mister LaForge, are you ready
to separate our guest from the
hull?
Ready, Captain.
Proceed.
I'm deactivating the atmospheric
force field now, Captain.
Engineering, report!
The power drain just jumped to
ninety-three percent, sir.
Captain, the offspring is emitting
a high frequency radio
transmission.
Is it trying to communicate?
The power drain is increasing...
approaching auto-shutdown.
Take the engines off-line.
Supplement with auxiliary power.
All decks go to emergency
condition seven. Life support
and critical operations only.
Mister LaForge, what is your
status?
I'm sorry, Captain... the bay's
been completely depressurized,
but... it's still hanging on.
I am detecting other radio
transmissions, Captain.
Sensors detecting movement within
the asteroid field... distance,
two million kilometers, bearing
two-five-seven mark one-six-one.
On screen.
At their current speed, the
entities will intercept us in
ten minutes, thirty-one seconds.
Weapons status?
Auxiliary power only... two
seconds phaser fire available.
Ensign... power readings.
We're on auxiliary generators...
life support is functioning,
that's about all...
Keep your eye on the generator
console. We've got less than
six minutes to get that baby off
our back before his relatives
get here...
Whatever we try, junior responds
by sucking up more energy...
I have a thought, Commander...
If you're interested...
Of course. What is it?
If the baby is nursing, perhaps
what we need -- is to find a way
to sour the milk.
I'm listening.
If we could contaminate the energy
he's feeding on...
... make it unpalatable somehow...
... but the emergency generators
are all we've got...
... and how do we modify them
without losing life support?
Exactly... unless...
What?
This is a space baby, right? I
mean, these creatures are born,
live, and die in interstellar
space?
Apparently...
Okay. All matter in space
vibrates in a specific radiation
band...
Twenty-one centimeters...
That's good, Commander, that's
very good. We could alter the
power frequency so it's completely
foreign to the lifeform's natural
vibrations...
And that might be just enough to
pour a little vinegar in baby's
milk.
We'll have to be careful... if
we upset it this time, we might
lose auxiliary power too.
If we're gradual enough, it won't
be a shock. Hopefully it'll just
lose interest.
LaForge to Bridge...
Go ahead.
Doctor Brahms and I have a plan,
Captain.
Two minutes until the creatures
intercept, sir.
Captain, we're ready down here.
Proceed.
Lowering wavelength in the energy
system, now...
Reading eighteen... fifteen...
thirteen... eleven... eight...
five... three... now at the two
centimeter level...
Any reaction, Bridge?
Negative. I detect no reduction
in the lifeform's rate of energy
consumption.
One minute thirty seconds to
intercept.
Okay... not sour enough. Leah,
take it down further.
Reading one... point eight...
point four... point two...
I guess it noticed what we're
doing.
The lifeform is emitting its high
frequency transmission... energy
consumption is rising...
Captain -- the creatures are
accelerating their approach...
they're changing color!
Mister LaForge --
Just a little more time,
Captain--!
Nudge it down... toward
point-oh-two...
Intercept in thirty seconds.
Point oh-eight... oh-five...
oh-three... now at point oh-two
centimeters...
Auxiliary generators are losing
power, Captain...
The entity has disengaged, sir.
Power returning to normal levels,
Captain.
Bring the engines on line. And
take us out of here.
Mister LaForge... Doctor
Brahms... congratulations. You
have weaned the baby.
Good work.
You, too.
Yeah... yeah, I'll admit... I did
get a little... attached to that
lady in the holodeck...
The computer never told you that
I was married...
I never asked... and the computer
is notorious for not volunteering
information... tell me about
him...
My husband? His name is
Michael... he's an engineer on
Garran-four...
... you'd like him.
I'm sure...
You remind me of him actually.
I do?
I really owe you an apology,
Geordi.
No you don't. I should have told
you straight out...
But if you had, I never would've
seen the look on your face when
you walked in on me... and me...
in the holodeck...
The look on my face... ? The look
on your face, I'll remember that
a long time.
I wouldn't change a thing...
Except the way I behaved... I
guess I came here with my own set
of preconceptions about you...
I'm just glad I finally got the
chance to know you... the real
you.

Tell me... am I... really that

Not so different... not so
different at all.
Worf to LaForge... there's an
incoming message on subspace for
Doctor Brahms...
My husband...
Acknowledged, Worf. LaForge
out.
