Captain's Log: Stardate 44246.3
We are investigating radiation
anomalies reported in the Gamma
Arigulon system by the starship
LaSalle. Preliminary readings
are inconclusive.
Mister Data?
No change, Commander. I can
detect no abnormalities in the
star's radiant energy.
Prepare two class one probes.
Probes ready, sir.
Initiate launch sequence.
Captain... Klingon attack cruiser
decloaking, bearing zero-one-zero
mark three-two-seven.
Belay that order, Mister Data.
Did Starfleet mention any Klingon
ships in this sector?
On screen.
We are being hailed.
All stop, Mister Crusher.
Aye, sir. All stop.
Open channel.
Hello, Captain Picard.
Ambassador K'Ehleyr... This is
an unexpected pleasure.
It's good to see you again,
Captain.
Lieutenant Worf.
How may we be of assistance,
Ambassador?
There is an urgent matter we must
discuss, Captain. Permission to
come aboard?
Granted.
Lieutenant, please receive our
guest.
Captain... I must request
permission to... send another
officer.
May I ask your reason?
My... dishonor among Klingons...
may offend Ambassador K'Ehleyr.
You are a member of this crew,
Lieutenant... and I will not have
you go into hiding whenever a
Klingon ship uncloaks.
I withdraw the request, sir.
I just received coordinates, sir.
Ready to transport two from the
Klingon vessel.
Two?
Yes, sir.
Energize.
I hope he'll be all right.
Alexander hasn't had much contact
with other children.
Bridge.
Not even a bite on the cheek for
old time's sake?
Perhaps you are not aware of my
dishonor. I have accepted...
discommendation.
I've heard. So now what? I have
to perform some ridiculous ritual
to talk to you?
You may not respect our
traditions... I do!
Sorry. I just thought you might
want to talk.
A few minutes ago, you looked like
someone with a question to ask.
Must I ask the question?
Yes. You must.
What should I tell Alexander...
that he has no father?
The Klingon Empire is at a
critical juncture. We may be
facing civil war.
War over what?
The usual excuses... tradition...
duty...
honor...
The word "excuses" implies that
there are ulterior motives for
a conflict.
I won't bore you with the
intricacies of Klingon politics.
Basically, two factions are
trying to seize power.
Do you believe there is a threat
to the Federation in this...
struggle?
Klingon wars seldom remain
confined to the Empire. Sooner
or later they'll drag in the
neighboring star systems, then
the Tholians, the Ferengi... the
Federation won't be able to stay
out of it for long.
This has been coming for some
time. Only K'mpec, the head of
the council, has been able to
maintain the peace.
Now something has changed that.
Correct.
K'mpec is dying.
He is aboard the cruiser. He has
come specifically to meet with
you, Captain. Alone.
It's about time you arrived,
Picard. Didn't she tell you I
was dying?
I heard you were ill.
I'm not ill, I'm dying. Sit.
I need your help.
If the Enterprise medical
facility...
Too late. For months I've been
poisoned with small doses of
Veridium Six.
The wine. There is no cure.
What do you want of me?
After I die... you will act in
my name to arbitrate the struggle
for power.
I will?
No one on the Council can be
trusted and... I have my reasons
for wanting an... outsider.
K'mpec. You can't be serious.
A Federation officer has no
business...
Nonsense. You are an accomplished
mediator. This is no different
than any other dispute requiring
your services.
On the contrary, I think it is
very different. And I must
respectfully decline.
If you refuse the dying request
of the Klingon Supreme
Commander... it will be a
Federation insult to all Klingons!
Besides, I've already sent the
orders to the leaders of the two
opposing factions. They're on
their way.
You had no right to involve me
without my permission.
If I'd asked, you would have said
no.
This is not a case of simple
mediation... you are asking me
to choose the next leader of the
Klingon Empire.
No. By tradition, the two
strongest challengers fight for
the right of succession. But as
mediator only you can designate
those challengers.
But you've just said there are
only two challengers arriving.
What is the point?
The point, my good Captain Picard,
is for you to discover which one
of them has killed me -- Gowron
or Duras.
Yes -- Duras. I thought you'd
find that interesting.
Interesting? Yes, I would say
that, since he conspired to strip
Worf of his good name and tried
to have me killed...
And I approved.
All for the good of the Empire.
That should be my epitaph.
Find the assassin. The Klingon
who kills without showing his face
has no honor. He must not lead
the Empire. Such a man would
be capable of anything. Even war
with the Federation.
Very well. I accept.
If there is war... it will not
end quickly. Millions of
warriors... hundreds of worlds...
destruction on a galactic scale...
Part of me regrets that I'll miss
it.
Captain's log: supplemental.
K'mpec, who ruled the Klingon
Empire longer than anyone in
history, is dead. We await the
arrival of Duras and Gowron...
rivals for the leadership of the
High Council.
There is no honor in attacking
the weak.
I would have won!
You must earn victory...
Where are the other Klingons?
There are no others on board.
Why?
The Federation and the Klingon
Empire were enemies for many
years. No other Klingons have
asked to serve in Starfleet.
Why?
A warrior does not ask so many
questions.
I don't want to be a warrior.
Hello! You're back early.
He made me leave.
Why don't you go to your room and
play.
Is he under arrest?
He knows nothing of our ways!
Our ways? You mean Klingon ways,
don't you?
He is Klingon!
He is also my son... and I am half-
human. He will find his own ways.
Why the sudden concern? You won't
even acknowledge that he's yours.
Why did you not tell me?
And what would you have done?
That's right... you would have
insisted that we take the oath...
just as tradition would demand.
You should not have kept this from
me.
Well, now you know.
I cannot... acknowledge my
relationship to the boy.
It would only harm him.
Because you were dishonored?
As my son, he would also bear my
disgrace... as would his
children.
Why did you accept discommendation
from the High Council?
My father was accused of
collaborating with the Romulans
at Khitomer...
I know. And I also know that
you challenged it...
Yes... at first. Ultimately...
I withdrew my challenge.
But why, Worf? I can't believe
you'd just give up.
What really happened?
Lieutenant Worf, Ambassador
K'Ehleyr, report to the Bridge.
On our way, Commander.
Klingon vessels Vorn and Buruk
holding stations at thirteen
kilometers.
Open a channel, Mister Data.
Channel open. Vorn responding
to hail.
On screen.
Let's get this over with, Picard.
In good time, Duras.
Even in death, K'mpec makes
foolish decisions. You should
not be involved in this, human.
The Sonchi ceremony will take
place in one hour aboard K'mpec's
ship.
One hour! What is the delay?
There is no delay. It is the time
I have chosen.
Exactly one hour, Picard. Do not
be late.
Keep that pahtk away from the
ceremony, Picard. He has no place
on a Klingon ship.
Picard... out.
Contact Gowron's ship, tell him
to meet us aboard K'mpec's vessel.
Ambassador, I'll meet you in
Transporter Room Six in an hour.
We'll begin the ceremony a little
late.
Mister Worf.
Worf, I know the next couple of
days will be difficult for you...
You have made it clear that I am
to perform my regular duties,
sir.
I want you to know I am aware
of your... discomfort.
Thank you, sir.
Ambassador K'ehleyr will be
preparing me for my role in the
rite of succession. But I have
no doubt that I will be calling
upon you for assistance as well,
Lieutenant.
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Granted.
Duras must not be allowed to lead
the council.
He has a legal claim, Worf. Your
personal feelings toward him...
It is not personal, sir. His
father betrayed my people to the
Romulans. Duras is a traitor.
Klingon tradition may blame the
son for the father's sins. I
cannot, Worf. Treason was his
father's disgrace. Duras' crime
was to put that blame on your
father... I will not forget that.
But you should not forget that
you chose to accept the
consequences of that lie.
To preserve the Empire.
The issue now is whether or not
he killed K'mpec.
Sir?
He was murdered... poisoned.
A Klingon would not use poison...
the murder would have no honor.
K'mpec believed the assassin to
be either Duras or Gowron.
I know little of Gowron. Only
that he is an outsider who has
often challenged the council.
But Duras... I know him... his
heart is not Klingon.
That's Gowron.
I hope this is brief.
It will be just long enough to
prove that K'mpec is dead.
Qab... jIH... nagil (Face me if
you dare!)
Qab jIH nagil!
Qab jiH nagil!
Sonchi. (He is dead)
Now complete the Rite of
Succession. It's obvious who
the two challengers are.
We will proceed according to the
traditions and precedents set down
in Klingon law.
What do you know of Klingon law,
Human?
We will reconvene on the
Enterprise within---
No! Finish it here, now!
I... have not received your report
on the explosion.
Two Klingons killed... a few minor
injuries.
Were you concerned about me?
As head of security... it is my
duty to be concerned.
Is that it? Just official concern
for my well-being?
You know my... feelings.
Maybe I've forgotten.
You were right... I would have
insisted that we take the oath.
But not just because of
tradition...
I thought about telling you...
wanted to tell you. I wasn't
ready.
When I left, you said you'd never
be complete without me. It took
some time... but I came to
realize... I need you too. You're
part of me, Worf.
jIH dok (My blood)
maj dok (Our blood)
I cannot allow you to... suffer
my humiliation.
There would be no suffering...
I don't care what other Klingons
think of you.
But what of the boy? He may want
to live in the Empire someday.
He would be an outcast... another
traitor from a family of traitors.
"Family of traitors?" I don't
believe that for a minute.
Respect my wishes in this matter.
I cannot take the oath with you...
And I cannot claim your son.
If you cannot be his father...
at least be his friend.
We haven't completed our analysis
of the bomb debris... and Doctor
Crusher is still studying the
remains of the two men killed in
the explosion.
We need more time.
Duras and Gowron will be here in
a few minutes. I don't think you
can delay this meeting again.
Is there some way of stretching
out the formalities once they
arrive?
In the modern Rite of Succession,
only a brief proclamation that
two challengers have been chosen
is necessary.
You said "modern Rite"... how was
the ritual performed in the past?
The old forms dictated that the
challengers perform the ja'chuq.
It's a long, involved ceremony
where the challengers list the
battles they've won, the prizes
they've taken... the idea is to
prove their worthiness to lead
the Council.
Can the old form still be used?
It's up to you... you can use
any form you want.
Captain... What do you know about
Worf's discommendation?
My interest is... personal. I
understand that you were there...
you stood by him before the
Council. I'd like to know what
happened.
I'm sorry... but I cannot discuss
it.
The Council must have a leader...
now!
Complete the rite so I can kill
this ha'DIbah.
You will die slowly, Duras.
You've already proved you don't
have the courage to face me...
perhaps you should plant another
bomb...
mev yap! (Stop!)
Sit down.
We will begin the ja'chuq.
What!
This woman is giving you bad
advice, Picard. The ja'chuq is
obsolete.
I choose to respect the ancient
ritual. Each of you must prove
your worthiness to lead the High
Council.
That will take hours!
Or days... depending on your
cooperation.
Kathless... the Unforgettable...
he united the Homeworld in the
year...
A tricorder...
It is operated by activating
the...
It is a bat'telh.
It belonged to my father... it
has been in our family for ten
generations.
Let me hold it.
No.
Do not think of it as a weapon...
make it part of your hand... your
arm... make it part of you.
The next meeting is in three
hours.
I would speak with you alone,
Ambassador.
I'm honored.
Picard is prolonging the ja'chuq.
Why?
He has sufficient reason to
proceed carefully.
He relies on you for his knowledge
of Klingon law...
Yes.
Then he values your advice. You
could quicken the pace.
Possibly. Why should I?
Your position is... unique. Have
you never wondered about serving
the Klingon Empire?
I serve in my own way.
As a Federation Ambassador.
A few rewards... but little
glory.
What do you want?
What do you want? Command of a
ship... a seat on the Council?
There are many opportunities for
you in the Empire.
Opportunities that will present
themselves only if you come to
power. You talk like a Ferengi.
K'mpec was also stubborn... he
too refused to listen... now he's
gone... you need not make the same
mistake.
K'mpec was old and weak... I am
not.
We've completed our analysis of
the bomb debris.
The explosive was a triceron
derivative.
The entire device couldn't have
been more than three cubic
millimeters in size...
Then it could have been hidden
anywhere in the room.
There's one other thing,
Commander... The bomb had a
molecular-decay detonator.
Only one race uses that device,
sir...
The Romulans.
How could Romulans have planted
a bomb aboard a Klingon attack
cruiser?
It would be impossible.
Not if the Romulans had help...
from one of the Klingons.
Klingons and Romulans working
together? They've been blood
enemies for seventy-five years.
Perhaps Duras or Gowron wishes
to improve that relationship.
A new Klingon alliance with the
Romulans?
If true, it would represent a
fundamental shift of power in the
quadrant.
Indeed.
It would put the Federation in
a very uncomfortable position.
Gowron or Duras?
Gowron came to me alone... wanted
me to speed up the ja'chuq...
offered me a seat on the Council
if I'd help him.
But does that suggest a Romulan
connection?
He also implied that I would end
up like K'mpec if I didn't
cooperate.
Captain... I disagree. It must
be Duras.
Why?
We have had prior dealings with
Duras that showed him to be...
untrustworthy.
Can you be more specific?
No.
Mister Worf, we now have a
conspiracy on our hands that
could be a direct threat to the
security of the Federation.
Yes sir.
As Chief Security Officer, you
will accompany me to the next
transition proceeding.
Captain, they will be incensed.
My presence will be...
disruptive.
Yes. It will.
Deck Twenty-Three.
Halt.
You suspect Duras. Why?
I cannot---
Don't tell me that again! I'm
trying to do my job while you
withhold vital information...
I will not discuss this with you
or anyone else.
Captain Picard seems well-
informed.
There's more at stake here than
your personal honor.
I am aware of what is at stake
here!
But you're still willing to hide
the truth!
I am hiding nothing!
You're hiding everything, just
like you always do... behind that
precious Klingon honor. Why?
Because you don't have the courage
to face life without clinging to
some archaic ritual?
Exit.
Computer, list stardates of the
last Enterprise mission to the
Klingon home planet.
Stardates 43685 through 43689.
How many ship's logs during that
period?
Forty-three officer's logs. Ten
personal logs.
Is there a personal log for
Lieutenant Worf?
Affirmative. Access is
restricted.
Eliminate all personal logs.
List the other forty-three in
chronological order... we'll
take them one at a time...
jIH DoQ batlh! (I claim the
honor!)
Both your claims have been
properly made and recorded. We
are ready for the final phase of
the ja'chuq. There will be a
recess while I review your
petitions.
I know that you're as concerned
as I am about the explosion
aboard K'mpec's ship. I assume
both of your investigations are
continuing...
The investigations are complete.
They revealed nothing of any
importance.
That's very interesting... because
our analysis turned up some
startling results.
Will you join us?
He has no place here, Picard!
I will not sit at the same table
with that!
It is my prerogative to
investigate anything relevant to
the Rite of Succession.
Lieutenant Worf is my chief of
security. His presence is
required.
We will not proceed...
I will determine how we proceed.
If you wish to withdraw from the
ja'chuq... that is your option.
What did your investigations
reveal about the explosion?
It was a bomb.
Was your analysis just as...
insightful?
It was a common explosive.
What type?
Triceron.
What about the detonator?
This is pointless! The findings
were inconclusive.
Fortunately, our investigation
was more... thorough.
The bomb used a molecular-decay
detonator.
What!
A Romulan device.
I will return to my ship. I want
to confirm these... conclusions
myself.
As will I.
Lieutenant, please be sure to send
a complete record of our findings
to both vessels... and to the High
Council.
We are adjourned.
...Khitomer...
Computer, why was the Enterprise
crew studying the transmission
logs from the Khitomer outpost?
Reference Chief Engineer's entry,
stardate 43686.1. Certain
transmission logs between the
Khitomer outpost and the Romulan
patrol ships were altered after
the destruction of the colony.
Altered. By whom?
That information is not available.
Computer, interlock with the
Klingon Imperial information net.
Interlock established.
Federation Ambassador K'Ehleyr
requesting diplomatic access to
High Council record. Security
code pah doQ cha!
Proceed.
Computer, display summary of the
most recent High Council inquiry
regarding the Khitomer massacre.
Access denied. Restricted
materials, du-ko-cha clearance
only.
By whose order?
Council member Duras.
Access biographical files.
Subject name: Councilor Duras.
Advise my counselors on the Vorn
to convene... there is much to
discuss...
What is that...
Priority message to you from the
home planet on a secure channel.
Excuse me, sir...
Sir, you cannot leave your
quarters without an escort...
I am not helpless. I don't need
a Starfleet escort.
I'm sorry, sir... Captain's
orders. I'll be happy to call
a security officer to accompany
you...
It's an outrage. An insult. I
will return to quarters.
Come.
I have been informed of your
attempt to access restricted
Council records.
I've been investigating what
happened at Khitomer.
Not an easy task... considering
that most of the records are
sealed...
Worf's father was a traitor.
No, the evidence was altered to
make it appear that way.
I found it interesting to read
that your father was also at
Khitomer. And you are the one
who sealed the records.
You would dare to insult my
father's name?
Don't play the wounded Klingon
for me, Duras... you don't do it
very well.
What happened in the council
chambers... how did you get Worf
to take the blame for you...
Do not pursue this matter
further...
The son betrays his people to
the Romulans just as his father
did... Eh, Duras?
One of the Klingons who died in
the explosion was with Duras...
the other with Gowron. I've been
examining the bodies... trying
to get a clue to where the bomb
was hidden.
There's always a pattern to the
lacerations and tissue damage.
It would normally give us a clear
indication of direction, distance,
force of impact...
'Normally'?
In this case, the pattern was
virtually impossible to
identify... I couldn't understand
it until I checked the
dynascans...
This wound is different from all
the others... it was made from
the inside out.
The bomb was implanted in one of
their forearms.
It is considered an honorable
way for a Klingon to die,
Doctor... a suicide that also
takes an enemy.
Which one of them was it?
Duras' man.
When we have more time I will take
you to the holodeck and
demonstrate in more detail...
Medical Emergency, Deck Eight,
Room one-four-two!
Gowron... ?
Duras?
Alexander...
You have never seen death?
Then look...
And always remember.
Stay with the doctor.
Worf, when did you... ?
Multiple stab wounds to the chest
and abdomen... too much trauma
to the internal organs. There
wasn't enough time to get her into
stasis.
Where's Worf?
I don't know... he left just after
I got here.
Riker to Worf.
Computer, locate Lieutenant Worf.
Lieutenant Worf is not aboard the
Enterprise.
Where is he?
Lieutenant Worf transported to
the Klingon ship Vorn at
seventeen-thirty hours.
On my way.
How could you let him in here?
He has claimed the right of
vengeance.
You have no rights here, traitor!
K'Ehleyr... was my mate.
And if Lieutenant Worf resists,
sir?
He's coming back with us one way
or another. Set phasers to
maximum stun.
I'm the only one, Worf... the only
one who can prove your innocence.
Kill me... and you will always
be known as a traitor.
Then that is how it shall be.
Worf!
Lieutenant, you are a fine
officer... your service aboard
this ship has been exemplary...
Until now.
Sir, I acted within the boundaries
of Klingon law and tradition.
The High Council seems to agree
with you. They consider the
matter to be closed.
I do not.
The Enterprise crew currently
includes representatives from
thirteen planets, Mister Worf.
They each have their individual
beliefs and values and I respect
them all. But every member of
the crew has chosen to serve
Starfleet. If anyone cannot
perform his duties because of the
demands of his society, he must
resign.
Do you wish to resign, Lieutenant?
Captain...
I would hope you would not throw
away a promising career.
No sir.
I understand your pain... we all
felt very close to K'Ehleyr.
A reprimand will be on your
record. Dismissed.
Worf...
Isn't it time for the truth about
your father's innocence to be
told? After all, the reasons you
accepted this dishonor were to
protect the name of Duras, and
hold the Empire together. Now
that he's died in disgrace...
where is the honor in further
silence?
Each member of the Klingon high
council shared in that lie. They
will not be so willing to admit
their own dishonor.
But the day will come when my
brother and I will... "convince"
them to speak the truth.
My parents... my human parents
will meet us at Starbase
Seventy-Three. They will care
for you.
Why can't I stay with you?
You deserve a home... a family.
My parents can provide that...
I cannot.
I miss her too.
Are you my father?
Yes... I am your father.
