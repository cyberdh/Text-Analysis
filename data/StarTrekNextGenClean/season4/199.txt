			Captain's Log: Stardate 44932.3
			The Enterprise is preparing to
			enter the Mar Oscura, an
			unexplored dark matter nebula
			first identified over a century
			ago.
			Commander Data is modifying
			several of our photon torpedos
			for an experiment designed to
			elicit more information about this
			unusual phenomenon.
			The initial dispersal pattern
			should not be more than seven
			kilometers in diameter.
			Six point eight kilometers...
			That should suffice.
			Is there something occupying your
			thoughts, Jenna? You are somewhat
			subdued today...
			I bumped into Jeff in the
			turbolift again this morning.
			Was the experience as emotionally
			problematic as last week's
			encounter?
			He... asked me to dinner.
			What was your response?
			I told him I'd think about it.
			As you requested, I must now
			remind you of the reasons you
			decided to end your relationship
			with Jeff.
			I guess I asked for this... go
			ahead.
			You objected to the fact that Jeff
			seemed unwilling to set aside
			sufficient time for you. You said
			he never did... the little things.
			He was unresponsive. You disliked
			the sound he made when he ate his
			soup...
			Okay, okay... I remember.
			This is the third time I have
			refreshed your memory. Do you
			wish to rescind our agreement?
			No, no. It's for my own good.
			It's just so easy to forget.
			Hand me that sequencer.
			Many lovers throughout history
			have had similar difficulties.
			Anne Boleyn was quite distressed
			that Henry the Eighth preferred
			the company of his huntsmen to
			that of his wife.
			As I recall, she ended up losing
			her head. I guess I'm well out of
			this.
			When did you develop an interest
			in romantic historical figures?
			Six weeks ago, when you and Jeff
			dissolved your relationship, I
			saw an excellent opportunity to
			study that aspect of human
			intimacy. Also, I believed it
			was my obligation to do so.
			"Obligation"? What do you mean?
			I anticipated this would be a
			difficult period for you. As your
			friend, it is my responsibility
			to be supportive in times of need.
			That is really sweet, Data.
			Data to Bridge. We are ready for
			the first illumination test.
			Acknowledged. All science
			stations stand by... we're about
			to light up the nebula. Mister
			Worf?
			Launch bay one shows ready,
			Commander.
			Fire torpedo.
			It's beautiful.
			Like watching fireworks when I
			was a little girl.
			It was wonderful.
			Thanks.
			Is anything wrong?
			My tempo was off. I felt like
			I was really rushing it.
			I do not believe that is so. Your
			rhythmic control has improved
			markedly. I heard no fluctuations
			during the performance.
			Well, maybe. But I ruined the
			coda. I got confused with the
			phrasing... I kept breathing at
			the wrong times.
			The contrapuntal nature of the
			composition is quite demanding.
			We will give the rhythmic
			patterns more attention in our
			next rehearsal.
			However, I am quite certain that
			the audience was oblivious to such
			nuances. They seemed to enjoy
			the performance thoroughly.
			Thanks, Data... you're really
			sweet.
			... every night, Miles leaves his
			socks on the floor. When we got
			married, I made the mistake of
			picking them up a few times...
			then I realized if I kept it up
			I'd be doing it the rest of my
			life... so I stopped... figuring
			he'd get the message and do it
			himself.
			One night goes by... two... a
			week... ten days... by now there's
			a pile of socks half a meter
			high!
			Come on... it wasn't half a
			meter...
			After two weeks I couldn't stand
			it any more -- I bundled them up
			and put them in the cleaning
			processor. And I'm still doing
			it.
			And a very good job of it she
			does, too...
			Keiko, you sound just like Data.
			He came to my quarters the other
			day to give me a music lesson,
			and he said the funniest thing...
			how did you put it, Data?
			I believe I observed that you seem
			to have an aversion to
			orderliness... but it was not
			intended as a humorous remark...
			So before we started, he gallantly
			offered to help me straighten up.
			And a very good job of it I did,
			too.
			Report, Mister Data.
			I am nearly finished compiling
			the readings from our most recent
			illuminatory burst. They differ
			considerably from surveys of
			similar nebulae.
			How so?
			Dark matter density is nearly one
			order of magnitude higher than
			previously found.
			Lifeforms here may have developed
			in ways never before observed.
			Interesting hypothesis. Are there
			any M-Class planets we could check
			out?
			Several, Sir. The nearest is
			approximately three light years
			from our present position.
			It's worth a look. We'll continue
			with our survey along the way.
			Ensign, get the planet's
			coordinates from Commander Data
			and plot a course, three quarters
			impulse.
			Let's increase the flow rate --
			see if that helps.
			Sometimes in the summer we went
			on cookouts... just my little
			brother and me, and Mother... She
			was hopeless without a replicator.
			But we didn't care.
			Children often do not develop a
			discerning palette until well
			beyond adolescence.
			It's wasn't that. It just felt...
			so good to be together... as a
			family. We didn't have much of
			that after my father died... so
			those times were really special.
			I wish we were back there now...
			you and I...
			The unidirectional nature of the
			time continuum makes that an
			unlikely possibility.
			That's one thing I've always loved
			about you. You make me laugh.
			You know, maybe I've been with
			the wrong men. Why couldn't they
			be like you, Data? You've got
			everything.
			That is not true. I have no human
			feelings.
			But you've still given me more
			than any of them. You've spent
			time with me when I was lonely...
			you've encouraged me when I was
			down. No one could have been
			kinder to me... those are the
			things that matter...
			Well, I think that's it.
			With your permission, Commander,
			I'll be going.
			Permission granted.
			I don't know if you're aware of
			it... but you're very handsome...
			See you tomorrow...
			Hi, Data. Want to try something
			new?
			This is a concoction I heard about
			on Prakal Two. I think it's
			great, but I want another opinion,
			so...
			Eighty-seven percent Saurian
			Brandy... Targ milk and Denevian
			mead comprise the rest... an
			unusually high concentration of
			mono-saccharides and fructose
			compounds.
			Too sweet, huh?
			If I didn't know you better, I'd
			say you were... preoccupied.
			Ensign D'Sora just gave me what
			could be considered a very...
			passionate kiss in the Torpedo
			Bay.
			Really?
			How did it make you feel?
			I cannot feel because---
			I know, I know. You have no
			emotions.
			What I mean is, what's going on
			in there?
			What did it make you think about?
			I was... intrigued. Jenna seemed
			to be displaying genuine affection
			toward me.
			And then?
			I calculated that Jenna's actions
			to date would tend to support the
			supposition that she wishes to
			initiate a non-platonic mutually
			exclusive relationship.
			You're just a starry-eyed
			romantic, aren't you?
			What do you think of her?
			I find her to be a competent
			officer... highly motivated...
			lacking somewhat in her
			understanding of the theory
			underlying dilithium matrix
			applications---
			But what do you think of her
			personally?
			Do you like her?
			I have become... used to her.
			It sounds like the next step is
			up to you.
			So what are you gonna do about
			it?
			I do not know. Clearly, an
			ongoing intimate relationship is
			an option. However, I am
			inexperienced in such matters.
			I require advice.
			Well, don't look at me.
			No, no. I mean, this time I don't
			have any advice to give. You
			can't tell someone how to handle
			their first love affair. They have
			to find a way to do that
			themselves.
			But I am incapable of love.
			Then this should be a very unique
			experience.
			Missing someone?
			I found Spot wandering through
			the corridor two sections away.
			Thank you.
			Forget to secure the door when
			you left?
			The door sensor has been
			programmed to recognize only
			humanoid forms for entry or
			egress. Spot could not have
			triggered the mechanism.
			Maybe someone came in while you
			were away and let him out by
			accident. Has anything been
			disturbed?
			No.
			Computer, has anyone entered my
			quarters in the last twelve hours
			other than myself or Commander
			LaForge?
			Negative.
			That's pretty strange... we should
			report a possible unauthorized
			entry to security, just to be on
			the safe side.
			Geordi, may I ask your advice
			concerning a... personal matter?
			Sure, Data.
			Should I pursue a relationship
			with Ensign D'Sora?
			Ensign Jenna D'Sora. Serial
			number CL-10928---
			Yeah, I know who she is. I
			thought she and Jeff Arton...
			They discontinued their
			association. Now she has made
			the... first move in initiating
			a relationship with me.
			What should I do?
			Hmmm... if she just ended a bad
			situation... sometimes it takes
			people a while... but if they
			jump into another relationship
			--
			... see, that can be a problem...
			unless, of course, she is ready...
			and then it depends if you're
			really serious. It's uh... kind
			of complicated.
			My advice to you is... to ask
			someone else for advice. Someone
			with a little more experience in
			these things.
			I think you should be careful.
			This is not some experiment you're
			running. Jenna is a living,
			breathing person with needs and
			feelings that have to be
			considered.
			Then you believe I should not
			pursue this any further.
			No, I didn't say that... I just
			want you to be aware that this
			will be unlike any other... more
			casual relationship that you've
			attempted.
			I have studied a great deal of
			human literature on the subject
			of love and romantic liaisons.
			There are many role models for
			me to emulate.
			Ultimately, Jenna will care for
			you because of what you are. Not
			what you imitate out of a book.
			My programming may be inadequate
			to the task.
			We're all more than the sum of
			our parts, Data. You'll have to
			be more than the sum of your
			programming.
			Klingons do not... pursue
			relationships. They conquer that
			which they desire.
			However...
			Ensign D'Sora serves under my
			command. If she were...
			mistreated, I would be very...
			displeased.
			I understand.
			I think you should pursue it.
			First of all, she's a beautiful
			woman who seems to be crazy about
			you.
			Jenna has clearly demonstrated
			how she feels about me. But I
			am not capable of returning those
			feelings.
			I'm sure she's aware of that.
			Data, when you get involved with
			another person, there's always
			a risk. Of disappointment. Of
			getting hurt.
			I cannot get hurt. But she can.
			Jenna knows that. And she's
			obviously decided to take the
			chance. Data, when it really
			works between two people, it's
			like nothing you've ever
			experienced -- the rewards are
			far beyond simple friendship.
			How far beyond, sir?
			Well, that's what I hope you're
			about to find out.
			Thank you, Commander.
			Captain, I am seeking advice in---
			Yes, I've heard, Data... and I
			would be delighted to offer you
			any advice I have on understanding
			women.
			As soon as I have some, I'll let
			you know.
			Second Officer's personal log,
			Stardate 44935.6. After
			conferring with my colleagues
			regarding the nature of romantic
			love in general, and my own
			situation in particular, I have
			reached a decision.
			They're beautiful. Come in.
			Mmmm. What are they?
			Crystilia. Their fragrance is
			an evolutionary response to the
			acrid nature of the atmosphere
			on Telemarius Three.
			You silver-tongued devil.
			Let me find somewhere to put
			these.
			Hmmm. That might not be so
			easy...
			It seems that your quarters have
			reverted to their earlier state
			of disorder.
			I know. I'm hopeless.
			There.
			They're beautiful, Data. It's
			so sweet of you...
			It was Commander Riker who
			suggested this particular flower.
			He said that it had worked for
			him in the past.
			You didn't talk to the entire ship
			about us...
			No. In actuality, less than one
			percent of the Enterprise crew
			was involved. It was necessary
			to balance theory with
			experiential referents. Both are
			required for a program of this
			nature.
			Computer, decrease illumination
			level by one third standard lux.
			This is all part of a program?
			Yes. One which I have just
			created for romantic
			relationships.
			So... I'm just a small variable
			in one of your new computational
			environments?
			You are much more than that,
			Jenna. I have written a
			subroutine specifically for you
			-- a program within the program.
			I have devoted a considerable
			share of my internal resources
			to its development.
			That's the nicest thing anyone's
			ever said to me.
			Estimated time of arrival, Mister
			Data?
			We will reach the M class planet
			in approximately eleven hours.
			You have the Bridge, Number One.
			Picard to Lieutenant Worf.
			Yes, Captain?
			Step into my Ready Room, please.
			And bring a tricorder.
			Aye, Sir.
			Captain?
			What do you make of this?
			I am puzzled, Sir.
			So am I, Mister Worf.
			Captain, the only detectable
			bioelectric residuals are your
			own.
			You did not --
			-- No. I did not.
			It seems we have a poltergeist.
			Sir?
			A mischievous spirit.
			Hoq-JoH.
			Perhaps this is some kind of
			practical joke.
			Sir?
			Perhaps not.
			I cannot explain how an intruder
			could have entered this room...
			I recommend we go to Red Alert.
			Not yet.
			Then I will order one of my
			officers to stand watch.
			Worf to Ensign --
			-- That's alright, Mister Worf.
			For now, I think circumstances
			warrant our caution -- nothing
			more.
			As you wish, Captain.
			Enter.
			I know it's a little unexpected...
			You are correct. I did not
			anticipate your arrival until
			nineteen hundred hours.
			I couldn't wait... I wanted you
			to have this.
			You have often expressed
			dissatisfaction with the Spartan
			nature of my quarters. Is this
			an attempt at embellishment?
			The cat's out of the bag.
			Spot?
			I mean you've caught me in the
			act. I'm just trying to brighten
			things up around here.
			It's Tyrinean. What do you think?
			Its line is both fluid and formal,
			yet retains an unpremeditated
			quality. The tactility of the
			surface enrichment is evocative
			of the neo-primitive period in
			Tyrinean blade carving.
			I hadn't thought of it that way.
			I'm sorry. Don't let me
			interrupt.
			Alright.
			Data.
			Yes?
			The Book of Love, chapter four,
			paragraph seventeen: When your
			girlfriend arrives with a gift,
			stop whatever it is you're doing,
			and give her your undivided
			attention.
			My literature search was
			apparently incomplete. I
			discovered twenty-nine books with
			that title, but none contained
			that particular admonition.
			That's because we're writing our
			own version as we go -- you and
			I.
			I should not have resumed my
			painting?
			No.
			Despite your suggestion that I
			continue?
			Exactly.
			The nature of our interactions
			is considerably more subtle and
			complex than I had anticipated.
			I have much to learn.
			Let's start with this.
			A critical analysis isn't
			necessarily the best response to
			a gift.
			Perhaps if I looked for a suitable
			place to display it.
			Much better.
			The ambient light in this location
			accentuates its contours.
			However, a gift should not
			necessarily be placed according
			to aesthetic criteria. A more
			central location will carry added
			meaning.
			Data, what's important is that
			you're trying. You don't know
			how much that means to me.
			Now, go back to your painting.
			This time I really mean it.
			I'll see you tonight.
			Riker to Captain Picard. You're
			needed on the Bridge.
			Acknowledged.
			We've reached the designated
			coordinates.
			But the M-Class planet... it's
			gone.
			Are you sure there was no
			malfunction in the sensors?
			No, sir. Lateral EM scanners
			registered radiation indicative
			of an M-Class planet.
			Sir!
			Mister Data, run a complete
			systems diagnostic --
			-- Atmospheric decompression in
			Bridge Observation Lounge...
			Environmental compensation
			sequence has been initiated...
			I am not registering a hull
			breach.
			Scan for lifeforms.
			None, Sir.
			Computer, boost the structural
			integrity field around the hull
			by one hundred percent.
			Field augmented...
			Captain. Standard air pressure
			has been reestablished in the
			Observation lounge.
			Let's have a look.
			Captain.
			I do not understand.
			Data, are you picking up anything?
			I detect no unusual readings.
			Curious. The transparent aluminum
			alloy of this window is
			exhibiting a pattern of transient
			electrical currents.
			Explanation?
			I have none. The rate is
			characteristic of a subspace
			distortion. But I am not picking
			up evidence of subspace fields.
			We will hold position while we
			seek an explanation for these
			anomalies. Divert all resources
			to that end.
			Hi, honey, I am home.
			Hi.
			Any luck at your end?
			Negative. We performed a full
			systems diagnostic and found no
			malfunctions.
			We did a full security sweep.
			Nothing.
			Can I get you a drink, dear?
			Well, yes. I think I'll have...
			a Calaman Sherry.
			Excellent choice. I shall join
			you.
			Two Calaman Sherries.
			Would you like some dinner as
			well?
			I'm too tired to think about what
			I want... maybe later.
			Whatever you like, dear.
			Darling, you remain as
			aesthetically pleasing as the day
			we first met. I believe I am the
			most fortunate sentient in this
			sector of the galaxy.
			Now... you must relax. Put your
			feet up. I will take care of
			everything.
			I could organize your closets.
			I have found that by grouping
			apparel first by function, and
			then by color from light to dark,
			one can more easily locate one's
			desired choice.
			Data... it's all right. You don't
			have to do that...
			But I am happy to do it.
			Please... put them down.
			What would you like, dear? Am
			I not paying enough attention to
			you?
			It's not that...
			Perhaps I have not given you
			enough compliments. Your hair
			is looking particularly silky
			tonight...
			Data... there's just something...
			strange... about the way you're
			acting...
			Am I not behaving as a solicitous
			mate?
			Well, yes, but...
			Tending to your every need?
			What is wrong with you tonight?
			My most recent self-diagnostic
			revealed no malfunctions. Perhaps
			something is wrong with you.
			I've never seen you behave so...
			foolishly. Why are you doing
			this?
			You may not tell me how I should
			behave. You are not my mother.
			What?
			"You are not my mother." Is that
			not an appropriate response to
			your statement that I am behaving
			foolishly?
			Data, I think you should just
			leave.
			You do not wish to continue our...
			lovers quarrel?
			Is that what this is?
			In my study of interpersonal
			dynamics, I learned that conflict
			followed by emotional release
			often strengthens a connection
			between two people.
			But there's just something
			forced and artificial about the
			way you're doing it. It's not
			the real you.
			With respect to romantic
			relationships, there is no... real
			me. I am drawing upon various
			literary and cultural sources to
			help define my role.
			Kiss me.
			What were you just thinking?
			At that particular moment, I was
			reconfiguring the warp field
			parameters, analyzing the
			collected works of Charles
			Dickens, calculating the maximum
			pressure I could safely apply to
			your lips, considering a new food
			supplement for Spot...
			I'm glad I was in there somewhere.
			A complete sensor scan of the
			planet and three survey probes
			turned up no surprises. No sign
			of life, nothing out of the
			ordinary.
			A complete sensor scan of the
			planet and three survey probes
			turned up no surprises. No sign
			of life, nothing out of the
			ordinary.
			Seven more unusual incidents have
			been reported. No casualties or
			damage.
			At present, we can only state that
			a subspace effect seems to exist
			within this nebula. After I have
			made further analysis, I may be
			able to adjust the ship's sensors
			to locate and identify the
			anomaly.
			The ship is at risk as long as
			we're sitting here. We can always
			continue our investigation from
			outside the nebula.
			Agreed. Ensign McKnight, plot the
			most direct course. Ahead warp
			one.
			Yes, Sir.
			Engage...
			Captain.
			Captain! Explosive decompression
			on Deck Thirty-seven!
			Bridge to LaForge... damage
			report.
			We're showing damage between decks
			-- we haven't localized it yet.
			Thorne!
			LaForge to Bridge... a cryogenic
			control conduit just blew out on
			us. I almost lost a man...
			Full stop!
			Yes, Sir --
			LaForge to Bridge...
			Yes, Commander?
			I think we have some structural
			damage between Decks Thirty-Six
			and Seven. We're checking it out
			now.
			Van Mayter, you take access tube
			twenty-three M and look at the
			the Bridge connectors.
			I'll cover the aft section. You
			go---
			During the series of events, I
			was able to measure the W particle
			inference which confirms one of
			my hypotheses.
			The unusual preponderance of dark
			matter in this nebula is causing
			small gaps in the fabric of normal
			space.
			As the Enterprise moves through
			the nebula, it collides with these
			deformations.
			Like a carriage bouncing over a
			series of potholes.
			That is an apt analogy.
			So every time we hit one, part
			of the ship momentarily phases
			out of normal space.
			Or when one of them hits us. My
			readings suggest that the
			deformations themselves are in
			motion.
			We're lucky one of these pockets
			didn't pass through a photon
			torpedo casing... or the
			matter/anti-matter containment
			pods.
			The question now is, how do we
			get out? Mister Data, can you
			reconfigure the sensors to detect
			these anomalies?
			Yes, sir, but they can only be
			perceived at extremely close
			range. Even at minimal speed,
			it would be impossible to maneuver
			the Enterprise quickly enough to
			avoid them.
			A shuttlecraft is more
			maneuverable...
			He's right.
			If we positioned a shuttle far
			enough in front of the
			Enterprise... it could detect the
			pockets and provide us enough
			time to maneuver out of the way.
			We could give the shuttle control
			of our navigational systems --
			that way, the corresponding
			maneuvers would be virtually
			instantaneous.
			Make it so.
			You are relieved, Ensign.
			I'll do my pre-flight once I'm
			on board.
			Not this time, Will.
			Sir?
			I'm going to pilot the shuttle.
			Captain... my duty as First
			Officer is to safeguard the lives
			on this ship. Including yours.
			The Enterprise can't afford to
			lose you, sir. Not in this
			situation.
			I believe our best chance of
			escaping this situation is for
			me to pilot that shuttle.
			This is my ship, Will. I've
			got to do it.
			Captain.
			Shuttle three to Enterprise,
			telementry link enabled.
			Ship's computer is accepting
			navigational inputs from the
			shuttle.
			Forward sensors are on line.
			Ensign McKnight, plot a course
			for the shortest distance out of
			the nebula.
			Plot laid in, sir. Outer
			perimeter at thirty-two million
			kilometers.
			Point one impulse, Number One.
			Acknowledged, Captain. We're
			right behind you.
			Riker to O'Brien, lock on to the
			Captain's communicator. I want
			to be able to pull him out of
			there if I have to.
			Aye, sir.
			Changing course... new heading
			two-nine-nine mark zero-two-nine.
			Main coupling is matching
			navigational inputs, Captain.
			New heading confirmed.
			I missed it by less than a
			thousand meters, Enterprise...
			Advise your status...
			Sensors indicate the deformation
			passing five hundred meters off
			the starboard bow. We're
			clear...
			One down, Captain...
			Resuming previous course.
			Confirmed. Outer perimeter now
			at thirty-point-one million
			kilometers.
			Changing course... heading zero
			seven three, mark --
			two-eight-eight...
			New heading... two-eight-four
			mark zero...
			Enterprise... I'm losing
			maneuverability...
			Sensors indicate damage to the
			shuttle's starboard impulse
			nacelle, Captain.
			I'm reading fluctuations in the
			thermal control sub-system...
			Captain, I'm bringing you back.
			Belay that, Number One! I'm
			re-routing the secondary deuterium
			supply... switching to manual
			controls.
			Transceiver signal is down
			forty-two percent. Navigational
			inputs are not registering.
			Captain, we've lost the link.
			You'll have to make course changes
			manually until we re-establish
			the connection.
			Understood. Get us back on line,
			Data. Geordi, try boosting the
			power to the L-U band. And
			increase the distance between the
			Enterprise and the shuttle. We're
			going to need some more room to
			make manual adjustments.
			Aye, sir.
			How far do we have to go?
			Sixteen million kilometers.
			New heading... two-nine-nine mark
			one eight...
			Yes, sir... I've got it... course
			corrected.
			Enterprise -- hard starboard!
			Aye, sir --
			Deformation impact on Deck
			Fifteen... science section...
			Damage?
			Report coming in, sir... minimal
			damage.
			Hold steady... I've completed the
			re-routing sequence... do you read
			my navigational inputs?
			Data, do we have the telemetry
			link back?
			I have increased sensitivity in
			the L-U band... it should be
			sufficient.
			Captain, let's try it.
			New heading. Two-seven-five mark
			three nine!
			Confirmed... the link has been
			re-established.
			Nine-point-four million kilometers
			to the perimeter.
			Mister LaForge, I am still having
			difficulty controlling the
			shuttlecraft.
			Yes, sir, your krellide storage
			cells are losing their charge.
			Maintaining manual control is
			gonna get increasingly harder...
			Estimated distance to the nebula's
			perimeter?
			Four-point-seven million
			kilometers, sir.
			Is there a way to transfer the
			microfusion thrusters so I can
			get a power boost?
			Possibly. If you augment the
			thruster sequencing so that the
			inertial dampening fields --
			Bearing -- two-seven... make that
			two-eight-five, mark
			two-five-five!
			Commander, the shuttle is out of
			control. Navigational link is
			severed.
			Mister O'Brien -- do you have the
			Captain's signal?
			I'm having trouble locking on,
			sir.
			Sir, the shuttle's inertial
			dampeners have failed. It is
			breaking up.
			Now would be a good time, Mister
			O'Brien...
			O'Brien -- did we get him?
			Aye, sir, we got him.
			I'm a little dizzy, Number One...
			but none the worse... on my way...
			Acknowledged, sir.
			Commander, we are nearing the
			perimeter -- one million
			kilometers away.
			All right, let's make a run for
			it.
			We're clear of the nebula, sir.
			Ensign, plot a course for Starbase
			Two-Sixty. Warp two. Engage.
			Enter.
			Hello.
			Hi.
			The place looks great.
			Thank you. It is much less
			Spartan, is it not?
			Much less... It looks... great...
			it really does... it looks great.
			Jenna, you are repeating yourself.
			I have found this to be indicative
			of mental distraction. Is that
			a correct assumption in this
			instance?
			I'm afraid it is.
			Then perhaps we should begin our
			meal. Among humans, a low serum
			glucose level is often responsible
			for --
			-- Data.
			Let's talk... first.
			I'm not sure how to begin.
			What is the subject?
			You and me. Our relationship.
			Yes?
			Data, sometimes people blindly
			make the same mistake again and
			again. Until it finally happens
			in a way so obvious and so
			blatant, that they can no longer
			deny what they've been doing.
			Are you currently experiencing
			this phenomenon?
			I didn't see it until today. I
			got out of a relationship with
			an unemotional man. And went
			right back into another with a
			man who is absolutely incapable
			of emotion.
			There does appear to be a
			recurring motif.
			You were so kind and attentive.
			I thought maybe that would be
			enough.
			It is not?
			No, it's not. Because as close
			as we are, I don't really matter
			to you. Not really. Nothing I
			could do or say will ever make
			you happy, or hurt you, or touch
			you in any way.
			That is... a valid projection.
			It is apparent that my reach has
			exceeded my grasp in this
			particular area. I am perhaps
			not nearly so human as I aspire
			to become...
			If you are ready to eat, I will
			bring our meal.
			No. That's alright.
			I'd better go, Data.
			If you wish.
			Jenna. Are we no longer... a
			couple?
			No... we're not.
			Then I will delete the
			appropriate program.
			I'll see you later...
			Hello, Spot.
