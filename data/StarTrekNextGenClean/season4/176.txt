			Captain's log, Stardate 44085.7.
			We have moved into Sector
			Two-One-Nine-Four-Seven in
			response to a distress call from
			a Talarian observation craft.
			The alien vessel appears adrift,
			and our initial probe has detected
			a life-threatening radiation leak
			within its propulsion system.
			Sir, I get no further response
			from the vessel.
			Maintain an open channel.
			Doctor Crusher and her assistants
			are waiting in Transporter Room
			Three, Captain.
			Sir, I must remind you that during
			the Galen border conflicts a
			common tactic of the Talarians
			was to abandon their observation
			craft, rig them to
			self-destruct...
			... and issue a general distress
			call, yes, I know...
			This particular guerilla maneuver
			resulted in two hundred and
			nineteen fatalities over a three-
			year period.
			Data, is there any way to detect
			their self-destruct device?
			Negative, Commander. The
			Talarians employ a subspace
			proximity detonator. It would
			not be detectable to our scans...
			... or the Away Team's tricorders.
			Right.
			Captain, the Talarian warship
			Q'Maire is responding to the
			distress call.
			Position?
			Halfway through the Woden sector.
			It'll take them hours to get here,
			sir, even at maximum warp.
			Counselor?
			There is life on board... but it's
			fading.
			Number One, assemble the rest of
			your away team and prepare for
			immediate rescue operations.
			Yes, sir.
			Ancilary power is failing,
			Commander.
			They're nothing more than
			children!
			I am Commander Riker of the
			Federation Starship Enterprise.
			We will evacuate you and give you
			medical care. You will not be
			harmed.
			Enterprise, prepping five Talarian
			males for transport directly to
			Sickbay... Trauma Team, stand
			by to receive injured... we have
			radiation burns, possible
			respiratory distress...
			Transport locked in and ready,
			Doctor.
			Stand by for my order.
			Captain, it looks like this was
			a basic training ship. Five
			boys... in their teens... all
			in uniform...
			Proceed with the evacuation,
			Number One.
			No other life signs on board, sir.
			Commander! Quickly!
			What is it?
			Look... this boy... he's human!
			Captain's log, supplemental: We
			have completed emergency
			evacuation of four Talarians
			-- and one human. How this young
			man found himself in the custody
			of these aliens remains a mystery.
			It's Jono, right? Is that what
			I heard them call you?
			I'm Doctor Crusher. I'm examining
			you for radiation injuries. It
			won't hurt.
			I have a son not much older than
			you. Maybe you'd like to meet
			him.
			Well, Jono... you seem to have
			escaped radiation damage. Pretty
			lucky.
			How did this happen -- ?
			What is it?
			He's -- terrified.
			They all just started up,
			Captain.
			May I have your attention, please?
			Please -- may I have your
			attention?
			Stop that immediately!
			Well. That's better. Now, what's
			your name, young man?
			He won't talk, Captain. We
			haven't been able to get through
			to him.
			Captain -- ?
			Captain... I am Jono. Take me
			home, to my Captain. Take me home
			to Endar!
			He managed to escape radiation
			trauma... but his scans showed
			something else...
			What?
			Two previously fractured ribs...
			a broken arm... a low-grade
			concussion. There may be
			neurological impairment... I'll
			have to examine him further. Jean
			Luc -- the Talarians have always
			been ruthless to their enemies...
			I think there's a real possibility
			they may have brutalized the
			child.
			Isn't it possible he was injured
			prior to his captivity?
			Not likely. He's been with them
			a long time... long enough to
			assimilate their cultural
			traits... and calcium trace
			patterns indicate the injuries
			occurred during the past seven
			years.
			But if they have... abused the
			boy... why would he devoutly wish
			to return to them?
			That's not uncommon. It was
			identified centuries ago as the
			"Stockholm syndrome."
			Now what?
			I suggested he take off his
			gloves... Suddenly he went out
			of control.
			Security, we need some assistance
			in Sickbay...
			Acknowledged, Doctor.
			Jono -- !
			She won't leave me alone! She
			keeps trying to dissect me!
			She was trying to help you!
			I don't want her help! All I want
			is to be with my brothers! Send
			us back to Captain Endar!
			Jono -- I want you to stop this
			immediately!
			Yes, Captain.
			That's better. Now, if we're to
			accomplish anything --
			Data to Picard.
			Go ahead.
			We have received a subspace
			communique from Starfleet Command,
			regarding the young human, sir.
			Very well. Doctor, Counselor...
			Mister Worf, escort this young
			man to quarters... he's to be
			confined there until further
			notice.
			Yes, Doctor.
			Why are you here, Klingon -- with
			them? Did they capture you, too?
			They are not my captors. They
			are my comrades.
			Why do you take orders from a
			female?
			Doctor Crusher? She is my
			superior officer.
			Among my people, a female could
			never outrank a man.
			You are human, and among humans,
			females can achieve anything
			males can.
			I am not human any more than you
			are. I am Talarian.
			You are confused...
			Stop that!
			I will make the B'Nar -- the
			mourning -- until I am back with
			my brothers!
			By matching DNA gene types,
			Starfleet was able to identify
			the young man as Jeremiah Rossa...
			Rossa...
			... as in Admiral Rossa, Data?
			She is his grandmother, Captain.
			He was born fourteen years ago
			on the Federation Colony, Galen
			Four. His parents, Connor and
			Moira Rossa, were killed in a
			border skirmish three years, nine
			months later when the colony was
			overrun by Talarian forces.
			I remember. There were no
			survivors.
			The child was listed as missing
			and presumed dead.
			I knew another one of the Rossas
			who was killed in action at the
			Krasner outpost...
			Tragedy, it seems, follows the
			Rossa Family... the Admiral has
			lost both her sons...
			She'll have something to celebrate
			now...
			Captain... if Jeremiah were
			returned to his family in his
			present condition... it would be
			a wrenching experience for
			everyone. Especially for him.
			He needs to re-discover his
			identity. He has to make some
			connection with his roots.
			I agree. Please take whatever
			means you need to accomplish that,
			Counselor.
			I don't think I can do anything,
			Captain.
			Why not?
			Troi's right. It's very clear
			that the boy does not respond well
			to women.
			The Talarians are a rigidly
			patriarchical society.
			Jeremiah needs to build a
			relationship with a man... a
			father figure... with whom he can
			explore his origins... and I think
			it should be you, Captain.
			Oh, no, Counselor! I don't think
			so. He needs someone who is --
			trained in these things.
			But you are the only person on
			board to whom he has shown any
			connection. If Jeremiah is to
			find his -- humanity -- then you
			are the only one who can help him.
			It's up to you, Captain.
			Jono... why do you make that
			noise?
			It is the custom of my people when
			they are in distress.
			Is it not also the custom of your
			people to listen to the wishes
			of their Captain?
			Yes.
			Then, as Captain of the Starship
			Enterprise, I ask you not to make
			that sound.
			Yes, sir.
			Good. Well. Now that we have
			that cleared up...
			Let's... get acquainted, shall
			we?
			What do you think of your
			quarters? I know it's a bit --
			sterile. But if there's anything
			you'd like... pictures, perhaps,
			or games...
			This is a cage. I am still your
			captive.
			Not at all. I thought you would
			be comfortable here --
			Are you going to return me to my
			Captain?
			We will rendezvous with the
			warship Q'maire at
			Oh-seven-forty. We are
			preparing to transfer the
			Talarians to Captain Endar.
			Including me?
			We will... discuss... your
			situation with Captain Endar.
			I don't like this place.
			Well, we can find other quarters.
			I have always lived with my
			Captain.
			Ah. Yes, well... that won't work,
			here.
			I'm sure you'll see... there's
			nothing here that would appeal
			to a young person.
			Put that down, please.
			It's Klingon.
			Yes. Put it back where you got
			it.
			Well. Here we are, eh, Jono?
			I notice you haven't taken off
			your gloves...
			Not here.
			Why not?
			So that I don't have to touch an
			alien.
			Jono... your Captain, Endar? Has
			he ever hurt you?
			Inflicted pain?
			Pain is not a consideration.
			Then he has.
			I did not say that. Can't you
			understand? Pain is not what
			matters. Passing the tests is
			everything.
			Is that what they are? Tests of
			pain?
			You don't understand anything.
			It's true I don't fully understand
			Talarians. But... you are not
			Talarian.
			I will not listen to this! I will
			not listen to your lies! Take
			me back to my cell! I'd rather
			be in prison than have you try
			to poison my mind!
			Come.
			You wanted to see me, Captain?
			Ah, yes, Counselor. Please --
			sit down.
			You may not be aware of this, but
			I have never been particularly
			comfortable around children.
			Really?
			For some reason, they just don't
			seem to respond to me.
			I see...
			Frankly, I think my time is best
			served carrying out the duties
			and responsibilities of a
			Starfleet Captain.
			Seldom have I heard an explanation
			so well rehearsed.
			All right, Counselor... I just
			don't think I'm the right person
			for this job.
			Strange, isn't it? You'll travel
			light years, dodge asteroid
			storms, brave hostile aliens...
			but when asked to assume a
			parental role, you cringe. Why
			do you suppose that is?
			I'm not cringing... I am simply
			acknowledging my limitations.
			When you were a child, did you
			have many friends? Other children
			you played with?
			No, but I don't think that has
			anything to do with anything...
			Perhaps it's because... no, this
			is foolish. What does it matter?
			What were you going to say?
			Just that... ever since I was a
			child... I knew exactly what I
			wanted -- to be a member of
			Starfleet. Nothing else mattered
			to me. Virtually my entire youth
			was spent pursuing that goal.
			In fact...
			I think... that I may have skipped
			my childhood.
			You know, Captain, almost no one
			is born being a good parent.
			Most people simply have to muddle
			through it, doing the best job
			they can.
			And... that's what I'm going to
			have to do?
			Yes. And you might be surprised
			at how good you could be.
			Computer, turn off that noise!
			Computer, what was that?
			The "Alba Ra"... a contemporary
			Talarian musical form.
			Jono? Where are you?
			Here.
			You turned off my music.
			Yes, I certainly did, and I expect
			it to stay turned off. Jono,
			would you come down from there?
			I see you've made yourself at
			home.
			I cannot rest on your beds. They
			hurt my back.
			Right... Jono, I want to show you
			something.
			Those are Connor and Moira Rossa
			-- your parents. That baby is
			you... Jeremiah Rossa.
			My name is Jono.
			You were born Jeremiah, on Galen
			Four. Your colony was
			destroyed, later, during a border
			skirmish.
			You knew how to laugh once.
			Do you remember any of that? Your
			parents, your home?
			No. I know that Endar rescued
			me. He told me so.
			Jono, your parents were killed
			by Talarians...
			It was war. Death is part of war.
			Captain?
			What is it, Number One?
			We have visual contact with the
			warship Q'Maire.
			Endar...
			You stay put.
			I'm on my way.
			Jeremiah... Jeremiah!
			Status, Mister Data.
			Q'maire at station, holding steady
			at bearing zero-one-three, mark
			zero-one-five. Distance
			five-zero-six kilometers.
			Are its weapons systems active?
			Negative.
			Captain Endar requests an open
			channel.
			On screen.
			I am Captain Endar of the warship
			Q'Maire. To whom am I speaking?
			Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
			Federation Starship Enterprise.
			We have rescued four crew members
			from your observation craft. They
			have received medical attention
			and are ready for transport.
			Your actions are duly noted. We
			will forward coordinates for
			immediate transport.
			You're welcome, I'm sure.
			One moment, Captain. We have also
			discovered a human among your
			crew.
			Jono!
			Actually, his name is Jeremiah
			-- Jeremiah Rossa.
			What is his condition? Is he
			injured?
			He was not wounded in the
			mishap...
			A blessing...
			But as a representative of the
			Federation I demand an
			explanation. Why has this child
			been held in your custody all
			these years?
			No explanation is warranted,
			Captain. He is my son!
			Captain's log, supplemental:
			Endar's claim that Jeremiah Rossa
			is his son is clearly
			unacceptable.
			However, to avoid escalating
			tensions, I have extended an
			invitation to the Talarian leader
			to come aboard the Enterprise so
			that we may address the issue
			face-to-face.
			Yes... I was in charge of the
			force that repelled the
			trespassers on Galen Four.
			I must say your Federation troops
			fought tenaciously.
			Among them Connor and Moira Rossa.
			I suppose. After the battle, I
			found this squalling child,
			huddled by the body of a young
			woman. His mother, presumably.
			And so, you -- kidnapped him.
			A harsh term, Captain. I rescued
			the child. There was almost no
			one left alive on Galen Four...
			was I to leave him screaming by
			his mother's body?
			You should have notified
			Federation authorities. To
			conceal him was a clear violation
			of our agreement.
			I took him in accordance with
			my peoples' traditions.
			What... tradition... is it that
			empowered you to capture a
			helpless child?
			I lost my son at the hands of
			humans during the conflict over
			Castal One. Talarian custom
			allows me to claim the son of a
			slain enemy.
			I understand your tradition,
			Endar. May I ask... does it
			extend also to brutalizing the
			surrogate son?
			What are you talking about?
			Our medical officer found evidence
			of injuries so severe that they
			might even be considered
			torture...
			No! I have never harmed Jono!
			Then explain the fractured ribs!
			The concussion... the broken
			arm...
			Youth.
			Have you ever been a father,
			Picard? Have you ever had a son
			desperately try to win your
			approval? Your respect?
			Jono broke his ribs riding a
			T'stayan -- six hooves, a very
			powerful animal. The arm? In
			a contest with other youths. He
			endured the pain -- and won the
			competition.
			He will be a great warrior one
			day.
			Doesn't he deserve to become more
			than that?
			His heritage is human, Endar.
			A heritage long since forgotten.
			Captain Endar, while on board,
			you are welcome to supervise the
			return of your crew. But I cannot
			allow Jeremiah Rossa to be
			returned to your custody. His
			true family is waiting for him
			on Earth.
			Then under no circumstances will
			I allow your ship to leave our
			territory.
			I have already reported our
			position and the nature of this
			violation to Starfleet.
			And I have already called our
			reserved forces into the sector.
			Are you saying you would be
			willing to go to war over the boy?
			Would you not for your only son?
			We have been at peace for years.
			Let us not rush headlong toward
			war.
			Then help me to avoid it!
			If you will allow me to see Jono,
			it will be clear to you -- I have
			been a good father. He has grown
			up happy in my keeping.
			Those were your parents. Do you
			remember them?
			That was long ago. Endar is my
			father.
			And who is your mother?
			We don't have mothers. Females
			are only for mating. And work.
			And the men? What is their
			purpose?
			Passing the tests. Becoming
			strong.
			The tests... endurance, pain,
			determination... all so that you
			can excel at making war?
			Females understand nothing.
			Life is not easy on our planet.
			If we do not test ourselves
			constantly, we become weak -- and
			the weak die quickly!
			And the females? Surely they are
			weak.
			Of course. But we protect them.
			I see.
			And when you look at this
			picture... of you and the human
			female who was your mother...
			how do you feel about her?
			Then you think it would be unwise
			to let Endar see Jono.
			I think it's dangerous. Abusers
			can have subtle but powerful
			influence over their victims.
			I'm not convinced he was abused,
			Doctor. I've talked to the man,
			and if I am any judge of
			character... I'd say he deeply
			cares about the boy's welfare.
			Captain, we learned long ago
			always to err on the side of
			protecting the child. I think
			Endar should be kept away from
			Jono.
			I'm not sure I agree, Captain.
			I sense... awakening memories in
			the boy... this is a very fragile
			time for Jono, and if we send away
			the man he calls "father" without
			even letting them see each other
			-- how will we ever gain his
			trust?
			Yes... There is also something
			else we should keep in mind. We
			are deep in Talarian territory.
			A semblance of diplomacy is called
			for.
			I shall allow the visit.
			All I ask... is that the visit
			be supervised. Don't let them
			be alone together.
			Agreed.
			Endar!
			Jono... my son...
			Have they treated you well?
			Yes, Captain. Except...
			Except?
			I was forbidden to make the
			B'Nar.
			It's all right. I know that you
			mourned in your heart.
			Well, Jono... what do you think
			of these humans?
			They... they look like me.
			They want to keep you, you know.
			I know.
			You are of the age of decision.
			What is your choice?
			Well? Do you want to stay?
			No, of course not.
			Then you shall not.
			I am going back to the Q'Maire.
			I will leave the humans with a
			choice. If they do not make the
			one we know is right... it may
			lead to war.
			You may die.
			I am ready to die.
			Captain, sensors indicate two
			warships approaching from opposite
			directions along the border.
			Their offensive potential?
			Talarian warships are limited to
			neutral particle weapons,
			high-energy X-ray lasers and
			merculite rockets. No match for
			the Enterprise, Captain.
			The last thing I want is to be
			forced into destroying one of
			their ships.
			They won't back off. They've
			been willing to fight to the
			death in past encounters.
			The lines are being drawn... all
			this for a chosen son.
			Is it worth it, Captain? To go
			to war -- over a child?
			You might not ask that,
			Lieutenant, if he were your
			child.
			There must be a way to avoid
			this...
			If we can just reach Jono... help
			him to make some connection with
			his origins... then he may choose
			to come with us.
			Do you really think Endar would
			go along with that?
			If Endar respects Talarian custom,
			he may have to.
			According to their tradition, a
			male child of fourteen has reached
			the age of decision. They undergo
			a ceremony of initiation and after
			that have the freedom to make
			their own choices.
			Endar's entire claim on Jono is
			based on Talarian custom... he'd
			have a hard time backing away from
			it now...
			Captain -- there's a subspace
			communication from Starfleet
			Command.
			On screen.
			Sir, the message is for Jeremiah
			Rossa.
			Have the boy brought to my Ready
			Room.
			Jeremiah... my name is Connaught
			Rossa. I am your father's mother.
			I wish we could talk in person,
			but that will have to wait. When
			I heard the miracle that you were
			alive, I wanted to reach out to
			you as soon as possible.
			I find myself wondering what you
			look like... and all I can do is
			imagine your father at your age.
			You come from a family that would
			make you proud. Many of them have
			given their lives to bring peace
			to the galaxy. You are the last
			of the Rossas. I am so very
			thankful that you have been given
			back to us, to carry on the line.
			Your grandfather and I will greet
			you with all the love in our
			hearts. Have a safe journey home,
			Jeremiah.
			She wears a Starfleet uniform.
			Yes.
			What is her rank?
			She is an Admiral.
			She outranks you.
			Yes.
			If I were home now, I would go
			to the brae, and run along the
			river... run as fast as I could!
			Jono...
			I can't do any of the things that
			calm me here! You won't let me
			have my music, you won't let me
			make the B'Nar! I feel if I have
			to hold still much longer I will
			die!
			Jono -- let me show you what I
			do when I get those feelings.
			I serve from here... like this...
			And you must hit it back before
			it bounces twice. Let's try it.
			Not bad.
			I win at all the games.
			I can believe it. Well, shall
			we give this a try?
			Jono? You all right?
			Fine.
			Take him and get to cover!
			I can't leave you!
			Jono -- what is it?!
			Take Jeremiah... get to the
			forest! I'll hold them off!
			No, come with us!
			Go!
			Mama...
			Jeremiah... Jeremiah... This way!
			She was... all red. I cried...
			but she didn't answer me...
			... she used to sing to me... I
			don't remember the melody, just
			the sound of her voice...
			Before I remembered these things,
			I was strong. Now...
			I have endured much pain. But
			this... I do not like.
			It is part of being human, Jono.
			But as deeply as you can feel hurt
			-- you can also feel joy.
			I do not think so. I think I will
			always feel like this.
			Jono -- are you tired?
			Yes. But I do not want to rest.
			I think --
			-- I think I am hungry.
			Well, how was racquetball?
			He gave me quite a game for his
			first time out.
			I look forward to the next time,
			Captain.
			I'm sure you do. sit down, Jono.
			What would you like?
			What's that?
			That's called a banana split and
			it's maybe the best thing there
			is in the universe.
			Here -- give it a try.
			It is called a spoon.
			Go ahead.
			Forgive me --
			I fail to see why this is amusing.
			Check your data banks on humor...
			subheading "Slapstick"...
			Comedy stressing farce and
			horseplay... ah, this no doubt
			is a variation on... "Pie in the
			Face"...
			Now do you see why it's funny?
			No, I do not. But I will take
			your word. It is very amusing.
			Let's start over. A fresh banana
			split for me, one for my friend
			here.
			Look at him. He's like a
			different person.
			Who would ever have thought he
			could laugh out loud like that?
			And half an hour ago he was crying
			in my arms like a baby.
			Two bleeders... single-plane
			penetration...
			I need the autosuture over here!
			It looks like the blade hit the
			sternum and was deflected... it
			could have been a lot worse.
			Then it wasn't a dream...
			I'm afraid not...
			No vital organs were pierced...
			no major arteries...
			Where is the boy now?
			Worf has him in security. Hold
			still...
			I want to see him. Here, now.
			He'll wait until I'm finished.
			Talarian warships converging,
			Commander, range five hundred
			kilometers.
			On screen.
			Any communication, Lieutenant
			Worf?
			No, sir. We have an open channel.
			Commander, the warships' closing
			velocities are decreasing...
			staggered approach vectors
			bearing zero, one hundred twenty,
			and two hundred forty degrees.
			Riker to LaForge.
			LaForge here, sir.
			Geordi, the Talarians are moving
			into attack posture. Classic
			triangular envelopment.
			I've tapped the impulse engines
			for additional power to shields,
			Commander. We're ready.
			Commander, Captain of the Q'Maire
			requests communication.
			Well, here we go. On screen.
			Captain Picard... have you made
			your decision?
			This is Commander Riker. What
			are your intentions, Captain
			Endar?
			Where is Captain Picard?
			He has been injured. I am in
			command now.
			Very well. Please prepare my
			son for immediate transport.
			I'm afraid that's not possible.
			Last night, Jono attacked Captain
			Picard and tried to murder him.
			We are holding him in custody.
			If you had returned him with the
			others, this would never have
			happened! I hold you responsible
			for this incident.
			He'll have to come back with us
			now, Endar. It will be up to
			Starfleet to decide the
			consequences.
			I do not accept that decision.
			I repeat, you will prepare my son
			for transport. If he is not on
			board in five minutes, you will
			suffer the consequences.
			Red alert.
			Talarian vessels routing power
			to forward rockets...
			Ready all weapons, Mister Worf...
			Jono... why did you do it?
			That doesn't matter.
			I think it does. It matters to
			me.
			What matters is that I have
			attacked a Captain. I am ready
			to be put to death.
			You think you are to be killed?
			To attack a superior is the worst
			offense. I will die at your
			hands.
			Jono, you aren't going to die at
			my hands or anyone else's.
			But... I committed a terrible
			crime...
			What I want to know is why? You
			seemed so happy just a few hours
			ago...
			I was.
			But then... I thought about my
			father. I felt like I was
			betraying him.
			I'd be throwing away all that
			he's given me... all that I
			learned from him... my home...
			running along the river... playing
			in the games... sharing victory
			with my brothers...
			... all the things that are part
			of my life.
			As I grew closer to... you... I
			knew it meant leaving more and
			more of that life behind.
			Forgive me, Captain -- I could
			not allow myself to do that.
			Q'Maire is requesting
			communication on a secure
			channel, Commander.
			On screen.
			Commander Riker, you have failed
			to transport my son aboard the
			Q'Maire.
			Our position has not changed.
			We are returning him to Starfleet.
			I regret your stubbornness. Much
			will be lost.
			One moment, Captain...
			Captain Endar, last night Jono
			attacked me with a dagger.
			Which he could not have done had
			he been returned to me with the
			others!
			There was a crime committed on
			board this ship... but it was not
			Jono's -- it was mine.
			When we found Jono, it seemed
			so clear what had to be done.
			We knew if he could only be
			persuaded to make the decision
			to stay... you would most likely
			let him. So with the best of
			intentions, we tried to convince
			him... and, in so doing,
			thoroughly failed to listen...
			to his feelings, his needs.
			That was the crime, and it has
			taken a huge toll on a strong
			and noble young man. It must be
			rectified.
			Jono will return home -- to the
			only home he has ever known. To
			the father that he loves. To you,
			Endar.
			Thank you, Captain...
			Please transmit coordinates for
			his immediate transport.
			Goodbye, Jono.
			Goodbye, Captain.
			Thank you.
