			It's been five months since Marc's
			accident. I haven't missed a
			single hour of my duties. I've
			volunteered for extra time in the
			nursery. My language studies are
			better than they've ever been.
			Someone else might have given in
			-- but I didn't.
			"Given in" to what?
			Death is a normal part of life.
			Maybe some of us are better at
			facing that than others.
			Or maybe some of us aren't really
			facing it at all.
			Sometimes, we suffer more than
			our suffering requires.
			What do you mean?
			Recovery from a great loss
			involves a great deal of pain.
			If we try to avoid that pain we
			only make it harder on ourselves
			in the long run.
			But I feel fine.
			Then why did you come to see me?
			I told you. I just wanted to...
			check in.
			Today would have been your
			husband's thirty-eighth birthday.
			You keep excellent records,
			Deanna.
			Last night. I dreamt Marc was
			with me, celebrating. I held him.
			I was so glad this nonsense was
			finally over. Then I woke up --
			Alone. And I knew he was dead.
			For the first time, I knew it...
			I looked everywhere for something
			that belonged to him -- anything.
			I forgot that after the funeral
			I told them to take it all away.
			You were there, Deanna. What in
			the world was I thinking?
			They didn't take everything away.
			How did you know... ? How did you
			know... ?
			... An ancient trail along the
			Kabul River in the Himalayas...
			it's a wonderful program...
			Will, it'll do you good to get
			a little fresh Holodeck air...
			Thanks anyway, but my horsemanship
			is a little too rusty to take
			on the Himalayas.
			Nonsense. We'll program an
			appropriately docile steed for
			you and...
			Captain! Sensors indicate
			a vast field of...
			Of what, Lieutenant?
			It's gone. But something did
			appear to be directly in our
			path.
			Deflector shields are not
			encountering elevated levels of
			interstellar matter...
			A sensor echo, Data?
			Uncertain... I have no unusual
			readings, Commander.
			I promise I'll come by to see you
			tomorrow.
			Deanna, are you alright?
			What... ?
			You faded out there for a second.
			No, I'm okay. Very... tired,
			that's all.
			You're sure?
			Yes... Will I see you tomorrow?
			Tomorrow. Thank you, Deanna.
			Of course.
			An aggregate field of
			plane-polarized objects has just
			appeared...
			And disappeared.
			Recommend we run a diagnostic on
			the forward sensor array. We
			don't want a ghost tailing us all
			the way to T'lli Beta.
			I'm not convinced it is a ghost,
			Commander. There may be something
			there...
			Ensign Allenby, full stop. We'll
			investigate both possibilities.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain's log, stardate 44356.9.
			Sensor diagnostic has been
			completed and indicates that all
			systems are normal. There remains
			no explanation for the images
			which appeared in our path.
			I have completed another full scan
			of the area, sir. There is no
			further indication of the
			anomaly...
			Prepare to resume course to T'lli
			Beta, Ensign. Mister Data, what
			velocity will put us back on
			schedule?
			An immediate resumption of our
			course at warp six will place
			us in the T'lli Beta system in
			six days, thirteen hours and
			forty-seven minutes.
			What, no seconds?
			I have discovered, Sir, a certain
			level of impatience when I
			calculate a lengthy time interval
			to the nearest second. However,
			if you wish...
			No, no. Minutes is fine.
			Ensign, set course and stand
			ready at warp six.
			Aye, Sir.
			Engage.
			Riker to Engineering... what the
			hell happened, Geordi?
			Checking... looks like the field
			collapsed before we could enter
			warp...
			Reason?
			Damned if I know. There doesn't
			seem to be any permanent damage
			to the nacelles. Recommend full
			stop while I check it out...
			Back to full stop, Ensign.
			Aye, sir.
			All decks reporting. Minor
			injuries only.
			Damage?
			None.
			Weapons and shields normal.
			Go to yellow alert.
			Captain... we've started moving
			again... something's pulling
			us...
			Troi to Doctor Crusher.
			Yes, Deanna?
			Beverly, I'm feeling very...
			dizzy...
			Did you hit your head... ?
			I'm not sure. I'm not sure what
			happened.
			Lie down, breathe deeply, stay
			calm... we've got calls coming
			in from all over the ship. I'll
			be there as soon as I can.
			New heading confirmed: zero-two-five
			mark two-seven-three.
			Speed is holding at one-tenth
			impulse...
			Whatever's pulling us sure isn't
			in a hurry...
			Picard to LaForge.
			Go ahead, Captain.
			If your engines are functional,
			we'll attempt to break free.
			Everything down here seems normal
			enough, sir... but I suggest we
			take it a little slower this
			time...
			Ensign, bring us around ninety
			degrees to starboard from our
			current heading...
			New course laid in, ninety
			degrees to starboard.
			One-quarter impulse. Engage.
			Aye,sir.
			Nothing, Captain. Course and
			speed are unaffected.
			One-half impulse.
			No change.
			Full impulse... rotate heading
			in five degree increments.
			Aye, sir.
			LaForge?
			There's nothing wrong down here!
			The engines are fine!
			Integrity field stress now
			exceeding eighty-two million
			kilo-dynes. Recommend immediate
			shutdown.
			Ensign.
			All engines down.
			We're still being pulled. Same
			heading. Same speed.
			I got here as quickly as I could.
			We've got a Sickbay filled with
			headaches. How are you?
			I was feeling intense pain when
			I first called you. Now it's
			gone. But I'm still a bit...
			foggy.
			I'd like to take you to Sickbay
			and run an internuncial series.
			I'm getting some unusual readings.
			Can you walk?
			All senior staff report to the
			Observation Lounge.
			Are you up to that?
			Yes, I think so.
			Is something wrong?
			No, I'm fine.
			Could it be some sort of tractor
			beam?
			No other ship is indicated.
			Mister Worf, your analysis.
			Tactical sensor readings were
			indeterminant.
			They don't even give us enough
			for an educated guess.
			And yet all sensors are operating
			properly.
			Can there be an intelligence at
			work here?
			Counselor, do you sense a
			lifeform out there?
			I don't think so... No, there's
			nothing...
			Nothing.
			Strange, I sense... nothing.
			It's alright, Counsellor. Perhaps
			there's nothing out there to
			sense.
			Indeed, there are many races that
			are not empathically detectable.
			The Breen, the Ferengi, the --
			-- No, you don't understand. I
			don't sense anything. Not out
			there, not in here. All of you,
			you're blank to me.
			Deanna.
			There's no indication of a
			concussion or a blow to the
			head... just a pattern of
			unresponsive neural cells
			throughout the cerebellum and
			cerebral cortex...
			Unresponsive?
			There's brain damage. How
			serious... I can't tell yet.
			But I feel fine otherwise.
			Can you treat it?
			I'm not sure. I'll have to study
			up on Betazoid physiology.
			The Betazoid brain has a
			remarkable ability to heal
			itself... this condition could
			reverse itself over time.
			It might. But you are half-human.
			That changes the map a little.
			I just don't want to offer you
			any false hope.
			It's just hope, Beverly. Not
			false hope.
			What would cause something like
			this... ?
			... because it happened to her at
			just about the same time we
			encountered the anomaly.
			There may be a connection... I
			don't know.
			If you were anyone else, you know
			the first thing I'd do?
			I'd send you to Counselor Troi.
			Well, then I have an advantage,
			don't I... I see her quite
			often...
			Deanna, it's no different than
			one of us suddenly going blind...
			Doctor, you don't have to tell
			me... I understand the
			psychology...
			You may understand it... but
			you've never had to live with it.
			I may be perfectly fine by
			tomorrow.
			And you may not be. Now I'll do
			my homework... I'll see if
			there's anything we can do to
			regenerate those cells... but in
			the meantime, I want you to talk
			to someone... there are several
			people on board with degrees in
			psychology...
			Fine. Fine. Okay. If I need
			to. All I want to do now is go
			back to work.
			Deanna...
			If there are no medical
			objections...
			No... medical objections.
			Thank you, Beverly.
			Will.
			Come in.
			I don't have a psychology degree
			but if you want to talk...
			You know what the worst part of
			this is... and I've seen it happen
			with so many patients...
			What?
			It's the way other people change.
			How they start to treat you
			differently.
			They walk on egg shells around
			you. Sometimes they avoid you
			altogether. Sometimes they
			become overbearing -- 'reach out
			a helping hand to the blind
			woman'...
			I'm sorry if...
			Well, I won't be treated that way.
			Hey, Imzadi...
			Oh, please...
			I've never seen you... quite so
			scared.
			I'm fine. If I get better, I
			get better. If not, I adapt.
			Life goes on.
			I'm a little busy now.
			Deanna --
			-- I really must finish this.
			I have some appointments this
			afternoon.
			Probe launch is successful.
			Telemetry transmissions are being
			received.
			Let's see what we've got.
			Nothing unusual here... same
			readings as the ship sensors.
			Expanding analysis parameters.
			Applying Bayesian functions...
			broad E-M and subspace spectrum
			polling...
			Uh Uh... No change...
			I am now adding virtual particle
			trajectories...
			Whoa. What is that?
			Unknown. I am attempting to
			analyze motion patterns... results
			still inconclusive.
			Last time I saw anything like
			that, I was skindiving off the
			Coral Reef on Bracas Five.
			Counselor's personal log, stardate
			44357.1. I hear their words, I
			see their faces, I know the
			techniques of therapy... and
			yet it all forms an incomplete
			equation. I am without insight.
			How do I help these people?
			You said you woke up 'a new woman'
			this morning.
			That's how I feel...
			Tell me about her - this new
			woman...
			She's not holding anything back
			anymore.
			She's not?
			I let it all out last night. I
			cried for two hours. I realized
			I'd never accepted the loss of
			my husband. I worked, I kept
			busy. I did everything to pretend
			it never happened.
			You feel different, now.
			Completely.
			Can I share something important
			with you?
			Of course...
			I'm having a very difficult time
			today. And I feel you need to
			know.
			What's wrong?
			I've temporarily lost my empathic
			sense.
			It's kind of like having one hand
			tied behind your back.
			I'm sorry... do you want me to
			come back?
			No, no, I'm fine. It's just...
			I feel before we continue it's
			important you know that.
			Okay... ?
			All right...
			Because I can't tell how you feel
			this morning, but it... it seems
			to me... one night of crying
			can't make up for months of
			pretending.
			No. You're wrong. I feel better
			today than I have in ages. You're
			absolutely wrong, Deanna.
			The probe's point of view reveals
			that the objects exist entirely
			in two dimensions. On a single
			plane.
			They have length and width, but
			no height. Virtually flat.
			That is why the ship's forward
			sensors did not detect them at
			first. We were looking at them
			along their edge. There was no
			surface to read. I will
			illustrate.
			Are they a lifeform?
			The movement pattern within the
			cluster is not a naturally
			occuring phenomenon in the
			Newtonian sense. The objects
			appear to be alive.
			Can you explain why they're
			pulling us along with them?
			Somehow, they polarize the
			graviton field around them as they
			move. We're caught in the wake.
			So how do we get out of it?
			We've processed the limited
			information from the probe... best
			idea for now is to try a
			controlled overload of the warp
			drive... jump directly to warp
			six. The laws of a
			three-dimensional universe say
			it should work. Not so sure about
			a two-dimensional universe
			though.
			Fascinating. So many
			questions... how could a two
			dimensional entity have access
			to a three dimensional universe...
			and are they even aware of us... ?
			Number One, if we can put off the
			T'lli Betans, I'd like to stay
			and investigate once we're free
			of this graviton field...
			It's too bad we can't tell if
			they're sentient.
			What do you mean by that?
			I'm doing the best I can.
			No one has suggested otherwise,
			Counselor.
			Mister Data, try to isolate any
			signal patterns from the cluster.
			Perhaps we'll find a basis for
			communication. Commander La
			Forge, we'll attempt your warp
			jump as soon as you're prepared...
			That'll be all.
			Counselor --
			How are you feeling?
			Beverly, I can't do my job. I'm
			absolutely lost. You've got to
			do something.
			I cross-referenced your scan
			results with the baseline files
			in the computer. Nothing helpful
			turned up. And so far the lab
			work is inconclusive.
			Inconclusive. What does that
			mean?
			It means there's nothing I can
			do now. I'm still trying...
			How do you people live like this?
			We get by pretty well actually.
			And so will you. In time.
			You have no idea. No idea what
			this is like. How can you know
			what it's like to lose something
			you've never had?
			I don't claim to...
			But you're telling me I'm
			supposed to get used to it.
			If our positions were reversed,
			what would you tell me?
			If our positions were reversed,
			I wouldn't have been in here
			treating skinned elbows while you
			were passed out on your office
			floor. I would have been there
			a lot sooner... maybe in time to
			prevent this before it ever
			happened.
			I've been working with Ensign
			Brooks since the death of her
			husband... she's avoided the
			reality of what happened...
			denied it to herself... and I
			realize I've been doing the same
			thing about my condition.
			That's perfectly understandable...
			It's time I accept the truth,
			Captain.
			And resign as ship's counselor.
			Resign... ?
			I can no longer fulfill my
			obligations. What other option
			is there?
			Deanna, I have been fortunate in
			having had access to your Betazoid
			abilities. Most starship
			captains must be content with
			human counselors. Empathic
			awareness is not a requirement
			for the position.
			It is for me.
			I'm sure after awhile you'll be
			able to compensate. They say
			when one loses a sense, the other
			senses become stronger to help
			adjust... a blind man develops
			better hearing...
			With all due respect, Captain,
			you don't know what you're talking
			about.
			That is a common belief which has
			no scientific basis... no doubt
			created by normal people who feel
			uncomfortable around the disabled.
			I am disabled. And I'm telling
			you I cannot perform my duties.
			There was a teacher of mine at
			the Academy who had been confined
			to a wheelchair since birth...
			Spare me the inspirational
			anecdote and accept my
			resignation, Captain.
			Counselor Troi has just resigned.
			Come in.
			I really would rather be alone
			right now.
			Too bad.
			Is this how you handle all of your
			personnel problems?
			Sure. You'd be surprised how far
			a hug goes with Geordi or Worf...
			Will, I don't know what to do.
			So you resign, cut yourself off
			from all the people who care for
			you...
			I look around me and all I see
			are surfaces without depth.
			Colorless and hollow. Nothing
			seems real.
			I'm real.
			No, you're not! You're a
			projection. With no more
			substance to me than a character
			on the Holodeck.
			I don't believe that.
			You have no idea how frightening
			it is for me to just be here
			without sensing you, without
			sharing your feelings...
			That's it, isn't it... we're on
			equal footing now...
			What do you mean?
			You've always had an advantage...
			a little bit of control over every
			situation... it must have been
			a very safe position to be in.
			To be honest, I always thought
			there was something a little too
			aristocratic about your Betazoid
			heritage. It's as if the human
			side wasn't quite good enough
			for you.
			That isn't true.
			Isn't it?
			LaForge to Riker...
			Go ahead, Geordi...
			We're ready to attempt a
			controlled overload jump to warp
			six.
			Acknowledged. I'm on my way to
			the Bridge.
			I'll check in on you later.
			Really, you don't have to...
			I'll check in on you later.
			Setting new course at optimal
			shearing angle: bearing two one
			seven mark two zero three.
			Engaging impulse engines, now.
			Go to warp, Geordi.
			Status?
			Unchanged. We have not broken
			free of the graviton field...
			Integrity field pressure has
			increased by two hundred seventeen
			percent, Captain.
			Warning. Differential stress
			will exceed upper limit in
			fifteen seconds.
			Disengage all engines!
			Warning. Differential stress
			will exceed --
			Engines disengaged, sir.
			LaForge, report...
			The energy we wanted to transfer
			to the nacelles was absorbed by
			the graviton wake instead. It
			set up a torsional wave that
			rebounded back to the ship.
			We're lucky the hull is still in
			one piece.
			This little nuisance is quickly
			losing its fascination.
			Sir, during our attempt to break
			away , I recorded a momentary
			alteration of the movement pattern
			within the cluster.
			You think we got their attention,
			Data?
			Possibly. But only for an
			instant. The pattern immediately
			returned to its previous
			dynamic.
			Follow up on it, Mister Data.
			Input your observations into the
			Universal Translator. Perhaps
			the movements themselves are an
			attempt at communication.
			Aye, Captain.
			Care for a little tea?
			I didn't mean to startle you.
			That's alright. I'm getting used
			to it.
			Are you?
			No.
			You want to talk about it?
			No.
			Good. I get tired of listening
			to everybody's problems anyway.
			They come in here looking for a
			shoulder to cry on... it's always
			my shoulder for some reason...
			You'd make a good counselor...
			You know, I always thought so
			myself. Maybe I ought talk to
			Picard, what do you think?
			About what... you becoming a
			counselor?
			You're leaving. With no counselor
			on board, there's gonna be a line
			at the bar... and it's not like
			I make a percentage on the drinks
			I sell... I'd just as soon have
			the nice office, you know?
			Well, it's more than just letting
			them cry on your shoulder... it
			takes an enormous commitment...
			I can do that.
			Guinan, people come to you to talk
			about things they want to reveal.
			A ship's counselor has to get people
			to talk about things they don't
			want to reveal.
			I can do that.
			Guinan... what are you doing... ?
			You don't really want to be ship's
			counselor...
			Why do you say that?
			I just know you're not serious.
			Have I given you any reason to
			believe I'm not serious?
			Well, not really, but...
			Then how can you know?
			Your empathic abilities come back?
			No. I suppose it's just...
			instinctive.
			Interesting.
			Ah, I get it. You're trying to
			make me see that I have other
			abilities to draw on... human
			intuition, instincts... but those
			skills only develop with years
			of experience, Guinan... it's not
			so easy...
			Who said anything about 'easy'?
			It's even harder than you think...
			human intuition and instinct --
			they're not always right.
			Makes life very interesting...
			So I'm discovering.
			Well, they're starting to line
			up... it's been nice...
			Guinan...
			If you want, I'll put in a good
			word with the Captain about the
			job...
			Problem, Data?
			Yes, Commander. Sensors are
			detecting highly accelerated
			interstellar gases...
			Suggesting?
			Uncertain, Commander. The
			phenomenon is within visual
			range.
			On screen.
			Magnify.
			It appears to be a cosmic string
			fragment, sir. Only one hundred
			seven kilometers long.
			Cosmic string?
			They're no wider than a proton
			and have gravitational fields
			as powerful as a black hole.
			The two-dimensional beings seem
			to be caught in the gravitational
			pull of the string. Their course
			is taking them directly toward
			it.
			And us right along with them.
			Captain's log, Stardate 44359.5.
			What began as a curious
			inconvenience has turned into a
			serious threat. At current
			speed, the two-dimensional beings
			and the Enterprise will be drawn
			into the cosmic string fragment
			in seven hours.
			The entities offer no indication
			that they are aware of the string
			fragment, Captain. Their course
			and speed remain constant...
			Sir, recommend we fire a spread
			of photon torpedoes into their
			field.
			Must we destroy them to save
			ourselves...
			It is not clear what affect a
			photon torpedo would have on a
			two-dimensional being, Captain.
			Nevertheless...
			We don't necessarily have to fire
			at them. Half-a-dozen photon
			torpedo bursts directly in their
			path could make them change
			course.
			Make it so.
			Torpedoes armed. Fire
			distribution set. Detonation at
			seven kilometers ahead of the
			cluster.
			Data, launch another probe and
			patch the monitor through to the
			main viewer.
			Aye, sir.
			Probe has been launched. On
			screen.
			Mister Worf, proceed.
			Launching photon torpedoes.
			Five seconds to detonation...
			Three, two, one.
			No change in the graviton field.
			The torpedoes are having no
			effect.
			Fire another volley directly into
			their field, Mister Worf.
			Launching torpedoes.
			Five seconds to detonation...
			Three, two, one.
			No affect, sir. Matter anti-matter
			explosions appear to be
			ineffective.
			Yes?
			Janet. I'm sorry... I meant to
			cancel your appointment today...
			That's okay... tommorrow then... ?
			Janet, I've resigned as ship's
			counselor.
			But why?
			Well, I think it was fairly clear
			during your last appointment...
			it was obviously non-productive
			and...
			Non-productive. I don't
			understand... how could you say
			that?
			But I couldn't sense what you
			were...
			Deanna, you were right about me.
			I had to go back and look at what
			I was doing, why I was trying to
			convince myself and you that I
			was a "new woman"... and I
			realized I was doing the same
			thing to myself all over again...
			trying to hide from the pain...
			I have to accept that... it's
			really just beginning for me, isn't
			it...
			So, as far as I'm concerned, it
			was very productive. Maybe you
			couldn't sense what I was
			feeling... but you helped.
			You wanted to see me, Captain?
			Sit down, please.
			Our situation has become critical.
			The cluster is still completely
			unresponsive. We have not been
			able to alter its course toward
			the cosmic string fragment.
			How much time do we have?
			Less than five hours. That's why
			I've called you.
			Sir?
			All that remains is the
			possibility of communication.
			There might be some way to warn
			them of their impending
			destruction.
			I thought Data already tried to
			establish communications through
			the universal translator.
			He has tried every technical means
			at our disposal to reach them.
			Captain, I wish I knew how to
			help. But under the
			cirumstances...
			If there is a psychology to
			these creatures, we must discover
			it... if there is an explanation
			to their behavior, we must know
			it...
			Even in your current condition,
			you are the most qualified person
			aboard this ship to assist.
			Data is currently in Observation,
			attempting to formulate a
			strategy. I'd like you to join
			him.
			Deanna. We need you.
			Captain's log, supplemental. If
			our speed and course remain
			unchanged, in one hour, the
			Enterprise will be torn apart by
			the gravitational forces of the
			cosmic string fragment.
			Are your signals reaching them
			at all?
			Possibly. However, the beings
			may perceive them as negligible
			noise rather than an attempt at
			communication.
			Is there any evidence at all that
			they're sentient?
			Negative. The nature of their
			movement suggests a simple order
			of intelligence.
			I'm sorry, Data... I don't seem
			to be much help without my
			empathic abilities... I just
			don't know how to draw on my
			human instinct...
			As I have no human 'instinct' per
			se, I cannot advise you,
			Counselor.
			Right now, I feel as two-dimensional
			as our friends out
			there... in this universe, but
			barely aware of it...
			... just trying to survive on...
			Instinct?
			Data, what if they're simply
			acting instinctively... there are
			inherent, inborn forces that
			drive every species. What they
			need. What they fear.
			We've got to discover what drives
			this species?
			I do not believe there is any way
			to know for certain, Counselor.
			We can speculate based on the
			available evidence...
			The only evidence we have at
			present is the brief interruption
			in their movement pattern during
			our last attempt to break away...
			Which may suggest some kind of
			awareness of our presence...
			Otherwise their course and speed
			have been constant.
			On a straight line to the cosmic
			string...
			You're convinced the string's
			gravitation is pulling them in.
			Since the cluster is
			two-dimensional, I have no direct
			evidence to support that
			assumption. But it is the most
			reasonable hypothesis.
			Why?
			It is unlikely they would
			intentionally move toward a
			destructive force...
			Moths fly toward a flame. Horses
			sometimes run into a burning barn.
			Data, don't you see, we've been
			thinking in three-dimensions.
			We have to get two-dimensional.
			Pardon me?
			Subspace signals, photon
			torpedoes, nothing's had an
			impact... it is reasonable to
			wonder if a gravitational pull...

			string's... would affect them.
			Please continue.
			What if they've chosen a course
			to the cosmic string? A case of
			pure stimulus-response. Driven
			by instinct... just like the moth
			to a flame...
			If Counselor Troi's supposition
			is correct, Captain... a replica
			of the string projected behind
			the cluster could induce them to
			reverse course. Disrupting the
			graviton wake long enough for
			us to escape.
			How do you simulate a cosmic
			string? It has the gravitational
			force of a hundred stars.
			I do not suggest we simulate the
			gravitational field of the string
			fragment, Commander. Rather the
			string's vibration.
			Vibration. This isn't a violin,
			Commander.
			Data's right. The principle is
			the same. A cosmic string
			emanates a characteristic set of
			subspace frequencies as atomic
			particles decay along its event
			horizon. I could use the ship's
			parabolic dish to amplify and
			reflect those frequencies back
			toward the cluster. The
			Enterprise itself would echo the
			cosmic string.
			How much time do we have, Mister
			Worf?
			Twenty-three minutes.
			Make it so.
			Frequency scan detectors
			engaged.
			Receiving...
			Data... we're picking up
			frequencies across the entire
			electromagnetic and lower subspace
			spectrum... trying to isolate...
			Can you focus the reflector field
			for me?
			Stand by...
			I am differentiating particle
			emission signatures now.
			That's doing it... Patterns are
			converging...
			Same course. Same speed. No
			change, sir.
			We are beginning to encounter the
			gravitational effects of the
			string. Impact is in four
			minutes...
			Sir, the shear force turbulence
			is impairing our ability to
			create an accurate simulation...
			Geordi, fire up the impulse
			engines and activate the ship's
			stabilizers...
			Stabilizers on.
			Electromagnetic and subspace wave
			fronts approaching
			synchronization.
			Three minutes to impact.
			Status?
			No effect on the cluster. Same
			course, same speed.
			Let's try to turn up the volume.
			Increase intensity, Mister Data.
			Increasing by fifty percent.
			They're slowing.
			Graviton wake field collapsing.
			Mister LaForge, take us out of
			here.
			My pleasure, sir.
			Course two nine five, mark two
			zero four. Warp six. We're
			clear.
			Excellent work, Mister Data;
			Counselor.
			The beings have resumed their
			course into the string. Three
			seconds to impact.
			It's all right. They're home.
			We were wrong. The cosmic
			string... it was never dangerous
			to them... it was the one place
			in the galaxy they most wanted
			to be.
			Deanna... ?
			Yes... I sensed it...
			Such overwhelming intensity of
			emotion. When we first
			encountered them, it must have
			been more than my senses could
			process.
			A short-circuit.
			Something like that.
			Beverly...
			Apology accepted.
			Therapists are always the worst
			patients. Except for doctors,
			of course. Stop by and see me
			later, okay... ?
			I was so awful to her.
			You were just being human...
			I never fully appreciated how
			difficult... and rewarding... it
			is to be human...
			I had a lot of help. Thank-you.
			You don't happen to know if that
			ship's counselor position is still
			open... ?
			It's been taken.
			Too bad.
			Better hours.
			And you, Will Riker... Thank you
			for making me face my other half.
			Frightening, wasn't it?
			A little.
			You were right, though. Maybe
			there's something to be learned
			when you're not in control of
			every situation.
			Welcome to the human race.
			By the way. The next time you
			call me aristocratic...
