Captain's Log, Stardate 44769.2.
For some weeks we have had a
Klingon exo-biologist on board
as part of a scientific exchange
program. Unfortunately, we
suspect that he may have been
involved not only in a security
breach but in the possible
sabotage of our warp drive.
What were you doing accessing
the propulsion system files on
Stardate 44758?
I didn't...
But you did... from computer
Twelve-B-Nine on Deck Thirty-six.
The computer logged in your
identification from your
communicator.
It must be a mistake.
J'Dan... we have confirmed
reports that schematic drawings
of our dilithium chamber fell
into Romulan hands... one week
later.
I know nothing about it.
And you don't know anything about
the explosion that disabled the
warp drive at almost the same
time?
No. I was not involved. You
accuse me because I am Klingon.
Our Chief Security Officer is
Klingon, J'Dan -- that has
nothing to do with it.
Send me home, then, if you are
so distrusting.
We've discussed that with the
Klingon High Council. You'll be
sent back... as soon as we've
finished our investigation.
I have nothing more to say.
Very well. Mister Worf... please
accompany the Lieutenant to his
quarters.
What do you think?
It's hard to tell. He is very
closed... but...
He is hiding something.
On the Klingon Home World... your
name is not mentioned... it is
as though you never existed.
A terrible burden for a warrior
to bear... to become nothing...
without honor... without the
chance for glory...
I have friends... powerful
friends... on the Home World.
I could talk to them... they might
help to restore your name...
If you could just take me to a
shuttlecraft...
It could be done without any one
knowing --
I do not know how you managed to
transfer secret information to the
Romulans... but I will find out.
Pahtak -- !
And when we inform the Klingon
High Council, they will put you to
a slow death.
Retired Admiral Norah Satie,
whose investigation exposed the
alien conspiracy against Starfleet
Command three years ago, is
arriving to assist in our
investigation.
Captain Picard...
Admiral Satie. Welcome to the
Enterprise.
I am delighted to be here.
I've managed to acquire my former
staff... My aide, Sabin Genestra,
from Betazed, and my assistant,
Nellen Tore, from Delb Two.
And my First Officer, Commander
William Riker. May I show you
to your quarters?
Captain... if Starfleet Command
is so concerned with your report
that they brought me out of
retirement... I think I should
get right to work.
Very well... Commander, will you
see to the Admiral's Staff?
First, I'd like to inspect the
damage to your Engine Room.
We still can't get in there,
Captain. The radiation levels
are dropping, but they're too high
to raise the isolation door.
How much longer will it be?
At the rate the levels have been
decreasing, we will be able to
gain entry in forty-nine hours.
Maybe the Admiral would like to
see the visual log of the
explosion.
This was logged four days ago...
at oh-three hundred hours.
At that point the emergency
confinement field was activated
and the isolation doors came
down. No one was killed, but
two of my people are in Sickbay
with radiation burns.
Have you been able to make any
preliminary assessments?
A slow-motion study of the
explosion suggests that the
articulation frame collapsed.
The schematics that were stolen
from the Enterprise... I believe
some involved the articulation
frame of the dilithium chamber...
That is one reason we tend to
suspect sabotage.
Other evidence lends credence to
that theory, Captain. A review
of the sensor logs indicates that
every systems reading was well
within normal parameters until
fifty-two milliseconds before the
explosion.
We haven't found anything that
suggests there was a malfunction
anywhere along the line.
Captain Picard... I think I need
a full briefing before we go any
further.
Commander Data... LaForge... I'll
admit I'm glad I don't have to
do your job... good luck.
Excuse me, Doctor...
Yes, Lieutenant?
When you have a moment... I must
ask you something...
Good timing. I'm finished here...
Mister Tarses... ?
Please enter these readings into
Ensign Dagget's file.
Yes, Doctor.
What is it, Worf?
Did you issue this to J'Dan?
Looks like a micro-replicating
hyposyringe... but it's not
Starfleet issue...
It was found... in his quarters.
J'Dan has Ba'ltmasor Syndrome...
he comes in regularly for
treatments... but we use our
own hyposprays. Is this one
Klingon?
Yes. Do you know what this
attachment is?
No... it's nothing we use...
Thank you, Doctor.
I hope that helps.
You've told me exactly what I
wanted to hear.
There are disturbing overtones...
to the idea of a Klingon providing
information to the Romulans...
Are you... aware... of any other
Romulan-Klingon connections that
Starfleet Command might have
encountered recently?
I don't believe... what Starfleet
Command knows or doesn't know is
for me to reveal.
This ship has had several
encounters which might suggest
a potential alliance between those
two powers --
We're aware of that, Captain.
What we must concentrate on is
the business at hand.
Come.
Excuse me, Captain, I didn't know
--
Please come in Mister Worf. I
particularly want our guest to
meet you... Admiral Satie...
my head of security, Lieutenant
Worf.
Captain... I have been pursuing
the investigation of Lieutenant
J'Dan. I believe I know how
he transferred information off
the Enterprise.
Good work, Lieutenant.
This is J'Dan's. It is fitted
with an optical reader...
specially modified to read data
from Starfleet isolinear chips.
He can extract digital information
from a computer... encode it in
the form of amino-acid sequences,
and transfer those sequences into
a fluid in the syringe... Then
he injects someone, perhaps even
without their knowledge...
Or perhaps with their knowledge...
The information would be carried
in their bloodstream in the form
of inert proteins.
The body itself becomes a conveyor
of top-secret files...
Lieutenant Worf... when we
confront J'Dan, I want you to
conduct the interrogation.
I would be honored.
Captain... I predict that officer
will be extremely valuable in this
investigation.
I tracked the movements of each
person who left the Enterprise
since you've been here. I traced
one Tarkanian diplomat as far as
the Cruces system... where he
disappeared and has not been seen
since.
That proves nothing.
This was found in your quarters.
I take injections. Everyone knows
that.
But your injections don't require
an optical chip reader. This
device --
-- has only one function: to
transform computer information
into biological sequences.
The blood of all Klingons has
become water... since the
Federation alliance we have
become a nation of mewling
babies... The Romulans are
strong... they are worthy
allies... they do not turn
Klingons into weaklings --
-- like you...
How did you damage the dilithium
chamber?
I had nothing to do with that --
No? You mean it was sheer
coincidence that it was sabotaged
after you gave the plans for its
design to the Romulans?
I do not know. I had nothing to
do with it.
You've admitted your crime. Why
lie now?
I am not lying.
You may have him confined, Mister
Worf.
Sabin?
I believe... he is telling the
truth.
He admits stealing the files...
but not sabotaging the dilithium
chamber. I get no sense that he
is lying.
If you're right... someone else
may be involved.
I think, Captain... that you have
a bigger problem on your ship than
one Klingon Exchange Officer.
I've seen this before. The
spectre of conspiracy on a
starship is a frightening one.
It's hard for me to believe...
but I am grateful for your
presence, Admiral. If anyone in
Starfleet can help us, it's you.
Captain Picard... I find myself
changing my mind about you...
In what way... ?
When Starfleet ordered me here...
it was with the express command
that we work together on this
problem... as equals...
My father taught me to avoid
partnerships... most of them are
woefully lop-sided.
That sounds like Judge Aaron
Satie...
You knew my father?
Through his writing. His judicial
decisions were required reading
at the Academy.
He was an extraordinary man.
Every night at the dinner table...
he'd pose a question for debate.
My big brothers and I would
wrangle it around, from one side
and the other... my father would
referee... he kept a stopwatch
on us so we'd have to learn
brevity... and he wouldn't let
us leave until he thought we had
completely explored the issue...
I'm willing to wager you trounced
your brothers in those debates...
More than once. Father would love
it when I nailed one of them on
some subtle point of logic...
All that I am, I owe to him. He
was... a giant...
You must miss him very much.
I like your Mister Worf. Very
direct, to the point. The two
of you make a good combination.
Captain... I've always preferred
working alone.
That way, if something goes wrong,
I don't have to look far for the
cause.
I resented your being assigned
to me. But... I was wrong. We're
going to make quite a team.
J'Dan did not make friends
easily... there are not many to
question...
You've done a thorough job,
Lieutenant.
I am strongly motivated in this
matter.
Yes. I can see that. And I don't
mind telling you I'm surprised.
Frankly, when I first heard about
your father...
My father...
...yes... There are some who
believe he betrayed your people
to the Romulans...
My father... what he did or did
not do... is no one's concern but
my own...
Of course. Of course. I only
meant... before I saw you in
action, I naturally considered
you a possible security risk...
but I want you to know you have
the Admiral's and my complete
confidence. You have nothing to
prove to us.
If there is a conspiracy on board,
I promise you I will find it...
Good. You know the ship, you know
the personnel... you know exactly
what we're up against... we're
counting on you, Lieutenant.
I will arrange for the interviews
to begin.
And how often did Lieutenant
J'Dan come in for injections?
About once a week.
Did you administer them yourself?
No. One of my assistants did
that...
Did you ever hear him say
anything... anything that might
have seemed innocent at the
time... that might now shed any
light on this investigation?
No, nothing. In fact, he rarely
talked at all.
Thank you, Doctor Crusher, we
appreciate your time. You are
excused now. Mister Worf, will
you bring in the next person?
Please sit down, Mister Tarses.
For the record, will you state
your name and position?
Simon Tarses, Crewman First Class,
medical technician.
I assure you this is an informal
inquiry... we're not accusing you
of anything. However, if you want
counsel, it will be provided for
you.
No, sir... I have nothing to hide.
Very well. How long have you held
your appointment on the
Enterprise?
Since... Stardate 43587.
Eight-eight...
Mister Tarses... your records
state that you were born on Mars
Colony...
That's right.
Then you are human?
Largely. My paternal grandfather
was Vulcan.
Yes, I see that here. Tell me...
what is your relationship to the
Klingon, J'Dan?
I... he... I mean, there's no
relationship... he just came in
for his injections...
Did you give him those injections?
Sometimes. There were several
of us, actually... I might have
done it twice...
Did you ever hear him make any
comments that might, in
retrospect, be suspicious?
Not really. He hardly talked.
Did you ever see him outside
Sickbay?
Once or twice in Ten-Forward...
with a group of people. I never
had a conversation with him.
Very well, Mister Tarses. I don't
think there's need for more...
Captain?
You're excused, Crewman.
Mister Worf...
Wait.
He's lying.
He's desperately frightened...
he's covering something.
It was clear he was frightened,
but that's hardly an indication
--
It's more than that. He wasn't
truthful. He's covering a lie...
one so big it's overwhelming him.
I think we've found the man.
I'm not sure I can sanction any
action against Mister Tarses based
solely on Betazoid intuitions.
Sabin has uncanny instincts. I've
learned to trust them.
I must admit... that I'm a bit
uneasy with this use of a
Betazoid.
You have a Betazoid counselor...
surely you are aware of the
advantages.
There is a difference between a
counselor... and an investigator.
Are you saying you never use your
counselor during interrogations?
I do... but I don't act on the
basis of her instincts alone.
Nor do I.
You're asking me to restrict
Tarses' movements -- based on
Sabin's "feeling."
If Counselor Troi suggested to
you... that someone on the ship
were dangerous... would you not
act on that? Observe him... curb
his activity?
I have to admit I probably would.
And maybe I should re-evaluate
that behavior.
Nonsense. Let's keep our
priorities straight... the
important thing is to uncover the
conspiracy on this ship... and
to prevent further damage. If
Tarses is a possible saboteur,
you cannot allow him access to
the sensitive areas of the ship.
And... I strongly suggest
continuous surveillance.
If we had better evidence...
We will have better evidence...
Sabin and Worf are continuing to
investigate... but if you don't
act until then... it may be too
late.
No. I won't treat a man as a
criminal unless there is probable
cause to do so.
And while you're being so
generous... you give a saboteur
the chance to strike again.
Last time it was just a hatch
cover... what if next time it's
more serious? What if lives are
lost? Can you afford not to act?
Engineering to Captain Picard...
Yes, Mister LaForge...
Sir, could you come to Engineering
right away? We've got something
interesting to show you.
We'll be right there.
We finally got in here about six
hours ago, and we've been going
over it inch by inch ever since.
We have made micro-tomographic
analyses of the dilithium
chamber... the hatch mounting...
the blast pattern from the
explosion...
We did mass spectrometer readings
of the residue for chemical
content... sifted the debris for
bomb fragments...
And what did you find?
See the frame for the hatch... ?
It ruptured --
-- right there. And when we take
a reading of that spot...
See?
I'm afraid I'm out of my element
here, Commander. You'll have to
interpret for me.
There are sub-micron fractures
in the metal casing...
That's right. A breakdown in the
atomic cohesive structure.
Yes... ? And what caused them?
Those fractures suggest nothing
more than simple neutron fatigue.
I would speculate that when the
engine was last inspected at
McKinley station, the hatch casing
was replaced with one which had
an undetectable defect.
I think, sir, that the conclusion
of our investigation must be that
the explosion was not
intentional.
That's the way I see it. This
wasn't sabotage at all... it was
nothing more than an accident.
An accident? I find that hard
to believe...
If my men say there was no
sabotage, you can be sure there
was none.
Let's keep our perspective,
gentlemen. Just because there
was no sabotage doesn't mean
there's not a conspiracy on this
ship. We do have a confessed spy.
And he had confederates.
Do we know that for sure?
Of course he did.
Do you think J'Dan could have
come on board the flagship of the
Federation and done all that he
did without help?
It would be difficult... but not
impossible...
We must continue to investigate
Tarses. He was hiding something.
Captain Picard... Lieutenant Worf
and I are working well together.
I suggest we continue... if for
no other purpose than to determine
Tarses' innocence.
I remind you all... that Tarses
is innocent... until he is proven
guilty.
Of course he is. What Sabin is
saying is that he and Lieutenant
Worf would like to establish
Tarses' innocence
unequivocally... for his own sake.
Very well. But I hope we can put
the matter to rest as quickly as
possible.
You've opened the hearing to
spectators?
It isn't good to have closed-door
proceedings for too long... it
invites rumor and speculation.
Besides... spies and saboteurs
don't like the bright light of
public inquiry. They're like
roaches, scuttling for the dark
corners...
This hearing is convened on
Stardate 44740 as a continuing
inquiry into the activities of
Crewman Simon Tarses.
Mister Tarses... for your own
protection, I have assigned you
counsel in the person of Commander
William Riker.
Begging your pardon, sir... I
appreciate it, but... I don't need
protection. I haven't done
anything wrong.
With the Captain's permission,
I would like to make a statement.
This is irregular. Let's stick
to procedure, here.
It's not irregular to have a
statement read into the record.
This is a hearing, not a trial.
Doctor, you may come forward.
Thank you. I would like to go
on record as saying that I have
worked with Crewman Tarses for
eighteen months. His work has
been exemplary. He is a model
of diligence and reliability.
He is devoted to Starfleet and
as far as I'm concerned, his
loyalty is without question.
There's no way this man is a
traitor.
Thank you for letting me speak.
Doctor Crusher...
Did you ever observe Crewman
Tarses with J'Dan...
Well, yes... he came in for
injections --
I mean outside Sickbay.
I mean outside Sickbay.
I think so... maybe in
Ten-Forward...
And whom else did you observe at
these occasions, Doctor?
I don't see what relevance that
has here -- it was an innocent
social gathering...
If it was innocent, why would you
hesitate to give us the names?
Thank you, Doctor Crusher. You
are excused.
Admiral Satie... if you have a
case to make against Tarses, you
had better make it. Or I am
calling this off here and now.
Mister Tarses. Isn't it true that
you have had access to the
biological supplies in Sickbay?
That's part of my job, yes.
J'Dan used deoxyribose
suspensions to carry the encoded
files he stole. Isn't it true
that one of your duties is to
prepare those suspensions?
Several technicians share that
job...
And isn't it true that your
security clearance gives you
access to all the stores and files
in Sickbay -- access which you
can exercise at any time?
Because I have access doesn't mean
I --
What would you say if I told you
there is evidence that the
explosion in the engine room
was caused by a corrosive
chemical... one that is kept
stored in Sickbay.
I had nothing to do with it --
How can we believe you? How can
we possibly believe someone whom
we know... we know... to be a
liar?
I object, sir... There is no
basis for calling Officer Tarses
a liar.
Agreed. Mister Sabin...
Captain, there is a basis which
will be clear in a moment.
Mister Tarses, isn't it true that
you deliberately and
premeditatively lied when you
filled out your personnel
application and compounded that
lie by repeating it to this
committee?
What -- ?
Isn't - it - true... that the
paternal grandfather of whom you
speak was not Vulcan... but was
in fact a Romulan? That it is
Romulan blood you carry... and
a Romulan heritage that you honor?
We're waiting, Mister Tarses.
On the advice of my counsel...
I refuse to answer the question...
in that... the answer... may
serve... to incriminate me.
Ensign Bailey, you and Crewman
Marcus will coordinate to track
Tarses' movements for the last
five years. Ensign Kellogg, I
want a list of all his
relatives... his known
associates... especially old
school friends...
And make arrangements to do an
encephalographic polygraph scan...
Mister Worf...
Yes, Captain?
I need to speak with you.
You are dismissed. Please get
your reports to me as soon as
possible.
What is going on here?
Captain... I am conducting the
investigation of Simon Tarses.
What has happened to us, Mister
Worf?
Sir?
I think... we're putting on a
drumhead trial...
I don't understand...
Five hundred years ago military
officers would upend a drum on
the battlefield... sit at it and
dispense summary justice...
decisions were quick...
punishments severe... appeals
denied. Those who came to a
drumhead were doomed.
But... we know there is a traitor
here. J'Dan has admitted his
guilt.
That's true. And he will stand
for his crimes.
Tarses has all but done the same.
How?
He refused to answer the
question... about his Romulan
grandfather.
That is not a crime, Worf. Nor
can we infer his guilt because
he did not respond.
If a man is not afraid of the
truth, he would answer.
No. We must not let ourselves
think that. The Seventh Guarantee
is one of the most important
rights granted by the Federation.
We cannot use one of the
fundamental principles of our
Constitution and turn it against
a citizen.
Sir... the Federation does have
enemies... we must seek them
out...
Yes... that's how it starts. But
the road from legitimate suspicion
to rampant paranoia is shorter
than we might think. Something
is wrong here, Worf... I don't
like what we have become.
Here you are, Mister Tarses...
do you care for lemon?
No, thank you, sir. This is fine.
Tell me a little about yourself,
Crewman... I know you were born
on Mars Colony...
Yes, sir... All my life I wanted
to be in Starfleet. I went to
the Academy's program for enlisted
personnel... took training as a
medical technician... served at
several outposts... and the day
I was posted to the Enterprise
was the happiest day of my life.
Did you ever consider applying
to the Academy... going the whole
route and becoming an officer?
My parents wanted me to... and
I thought about it... I used to
sit under this big tree near the
parade grounds...
An elm tree? With a circular
bench?
That's the one...
I spent many an hour there. It
was my favorite spot to study.
I used to sit... and watch the
drills... and picture myself an
officer. I knew it would make
my mother happy...
But you didn't do it.
No... I was eighteen, and eager...
the last thing I wanted to do was
spend four years sitting in
classrooms... I wanted to be out
there... traveling the stars...
I didn't want to wait for
anything...
And now... it's done, isn't it?
My career in Starfleet is
finished...
Not if you aren't guilty.
It doesn't matter. I lied on my
application... and that mistake
will be with me for the rest of
my life.
I couldn't wait to get started...
and now it's over...
Mister Worf has found a brother
who still lives on Mars Colony...
contact someone there and have
him interviewed...
Admiral Satie...
... and start a background check
into all his friends from the
Academy training program.
Yes, Captain?
I'd like to talk to you.
Of course.
In private...
... and off the record.
Of course, Captain.
After all... you are my partner
in this.
I cannot possibly believe you mean
this.
But I do. This must stop. It's
gone too far... you lied to him
about the Engine Room -- there
was no volatile chemical found
there...
It's just a tactic... a way of
applying pressure.
We are hounding an innocent man.
And how, may I ask, have you
managed to determine that?
I talked with him.
I see. And he told you he was
a victim of circumstance...
blameless and pure...
No... he admits his mistake in
falsifying his application... but
that doesn't make him a traitor.
Can you be so incredibly
naive... ?
Captain... do you know how I have
spent the last four years?
Traveling from planet to Starbase
to planet...
I have no home... I live on
starships and shuttlecraft... I
haven't seen a family member in
years... I have no friends.
But I have a purpose. My father
taught me... from the time I was
a little girl still clutching a
blanket... that the United
Federation of Planets is the most
remarkable institution ever
conceived. It is my cause to make
sure that this extraordinary union
is preserved...
I cannot imagine why you are
suddenly trying to block this
investigation... there have been
others, in the past, who got in
my way. They came to regret it.
The hearings on Simon Tarses must
stop. If necessary, I will go
to Starfleet Command.
Captain, I have news for you...
I've been in constant contact with
Starfleet Command. And the
hearings aren't going to stop --
they're going to be expanded.
What are you saying -- ?
I am going to get to the heart
of this conspiracy... if it means
investigating every last person
on this ship.
And every hearing from now on
will be held in the presence of
Admiral Thomas Henry of Starfleet
Security. I've requested that
he be brought here at once...
You never told me about this --
I report directly to Starfleet
Command. I do not require your
permission or your approval for
my decisions.
Admiral... what you're doing
here... is unethical... it's
immoral... and I will fight it.
Do what you must, Captain. And
so will I.
Captain, the warp engines are back
on line. We are ready to
commence restart sequences.
Sir?
Yes... ? Oh... yes, Mister Data.
Proceed.
Are you all right, Captain?
Yes, of course. Just a bit --
preoccupied.
Admiral Satie has ordered you to
report to the interrogation room
at oh-nine-hundred hours tomorrow
morning.
You are to be questioned before
the committee.
Your full name?
Jean-Luc Picard.
Rank and position?
Captain, Federation Starship
Enterprise.
How long have you held that post?
Over three years. Since Stardate
41140.
Very well.
Admiral?
If you don't mind... I would like
to address the committee.
If you have a statement, you'll
get an opportunity to make it
later --
I believe that Chapter Four,
Article Twelve of the Uniform Code
of Justice grants me the right
to make a statement before
questioning begins...
Very well.
I am deeply concerned by what is
happening here. It began when
we apprehended a spy, a man who
admitted his guilt and who will
answer for his crime. But the
hunt didn't stop there. Another
man, Simon Tarses, was brought
to trial -- and it was a trial,
no matter what others may call
it.
Unfortunately, it was a trial
based on insinuation and innuendo.
Nothing substantive against
Crewman Tarses was offered, much
less proven.
This man has a Romulan
grandfather. For that, his career
stands in ruins. Have we become
so fearful? Have we become so
cowardly that we must extinguish
a man because he carries the blood
of a current enemy?
I remind you... we are not
descended from cowardly people.
We come from those who were
willing to think the unthinkable,
speak the unspeakable...
... and to defend with passion
ideas and causes which were, at
the moment, unpopular.
Admiral, let us not condemn Simon
Tarses or anyone else on the basis
of half-truth. I implore you...
do not continue with this
proceeding. End it here.
Captain Picard... do you believe
in the Prime Directive?
Of course.
In fact, it is Starfleet General
Order Number One, isn't it?
Your point, Admiral... ?
Would it surprise you to learn
that you have violated the Prime
Directive a total of nine times
since you took command of the
Enterprise?
I must say, Captain, it surprised
the hell out of me.
My reports to Starfleet document
the circumstances in each of those
instances --
Yes, we're looking into those
reports, Captain, very closely
into those reports... after which
I'm sure we'll have more questions
for you about your so-called
commitment to Starfleet's Prime
Directive.
Captain, could you explain just
what happened on Stardate 44390?
Excuse me?
Let me refresh your memory. You
were transporting a Vulcan
ambassador... T'Pel...
I was following orders to deliver
the ambassador to a destination
near the Neutral Zone, and --
I don't think we need the
preamble.
In fact, she was not a Vulcan at
all, was she? She was a Romulan
spy.
That's correct.
A spy whom you delivered back
into the hands of the enemy.
Tell me, Captain... when the
deception was revealed... and she
stood proudly on the Bridge of
a Romulan ship... did you make
any effort to retrieve her?
No.
No? Even though you knew she
carried Federation secrets she
had been accumulating for years?
There was no chance of getting
her back. We were deep in Romulan
space. The safety of my crew was
my primary concern.
The Enterprise could have been
captured by Romulans... Captain
Picard did the only thing he could.
Really, Lieutenant? And where
were you while this traitor was
on board the Enterprise? Where
was ship's security?
Wouldn't you say it is
questionable judgment, Captain,
to have a security officer whose
father was a Romulan
collaborator?
Lieutenant?
Captain Picard... have you fully
recovered from your experience
with the Borg?
Yes. I am fully recovered.
It must have been awful...
actually becoming one of them...
being forced to use your vast
knowledge of Starfleet operations
to aid the Borg...
Just how many of our ships were
destroyed?
...ah. I have it...
thirty-nine... with the loss of
life measured at nearly eleven
thousand...
One wonders how this man can sleep
at night... having caused so much
destruction...
I question your actions,
Captain... I question your
choices... I question your
loyalty...
There is a saying... which many
of us have heard since we were
school children... "With the first
link, the chain is forged. The
first speech censured, the first
thought forbidden, the first
freedom denied -- chains us all,
irrevocably."
Those words were uttered by Judge
Aaron Satie -- as wisdom and
warning. The very first time any
man's freedoms are trampled...
we are all damaged.
I fear... that today... on this
starship... we are forging that
chain.
How dare you -- you who consort
with Romulans... invoke my
father's name to support your
traitorous arguments... It is
an offense... to everything I hold
dear... to hear those words used
to subvert the United Federation
of Planets.
My father was a great man... his
name stands for principle, and
integrity... you dirty that name
by speaking it...
He loved the Federation...
but you, Picard... corrupt it...
you and those like you undermine
our very way of life...
I will expose you for what you
are... I've brought down bigger
men than you, Picard...
I have nothing more to say.
Perhaps... we should take a
recess... until tomorrow.
Am I bothering you, sir?
No... please, come in, Mister
Worf.
It's over. Admiral Henry has
called an end to any more hearings
on this matter.
That's good.
Admiral Satie... has left the
Enterprise.
We think we have come so far...
the torture of heretics and the
burning of witches is ancient
history... and then... before you
can blink an eye... it threatens
to start all over again.
I believed her... I helped her...
I didn't see what she was.
Villains who wear black hats are
easy to spot. Those who clothe
themselves in good deeds are well
camouflaged.
I think... after yesterday...
people will not be as ready to
trust her.
Maybe. But it won't stop her.
She -- someone like her -- will
always be with us... waiting for
the right climate to flourish...
spreading disease in the name of
liberty.
Vigilance, Worf. That is the
price we must continually pay.
