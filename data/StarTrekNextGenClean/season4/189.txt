Ready... lift!
He took a severe blow... possible
trauma to the telencephalon...
Start fifteen octares of
quadroline. We'll need a complete
del-scan series.
I can't find his cardial organ...
What do you mean? I'm reading
a steady circulation...
There it is... up here...
In his digestive tract?
Have you ever seen anything like
this... ?
He's missing three costal struts
on one side and four on the other...
You think that's something... look
at this...
He has digits on his terminus...
What are you?
What happened?
You're in the crisis room at the
Sikla Medical Facility. You've
had a severe injury, but you're
going to be all right.
I was caught in the riot when the
police moved in... that's the last
thing I remember.
Can you tell us your name?
Rivas. Rivas Jakara.
Rivas Jakara. Where do you live?
In the Marta community on the
southern continent...
You're a long way from home.
Are there any members of your
family we should notify...
No... I have no family.
I can't stay here... I have to
get back...
You're in no condition to leave
yet...
There are several... unusual
things about your case, Mister
Jakara... your cranial lobes, for
example. They seem to be surgical
implants...
I did have some cosmetic
surgery... to correct a genetic
birth defect...
And these? Another birth defect?
Yes, isn't that something? My
father's were the same way...
You want us to believe that all
your abnormalities are inherited
genetic traits?
I understand your confusion. My
personal physician is much more
familiar with these... genetic
irregularities... to be honest,
I'd feel better if I were back
home under her care...
Why don't I talk to her about
that... what's her name?
Crusher... but actually, I'm not
sure you'll be able to reach her.
Why not?
She's taking... a sabbatical.
Well, we'll do the best we can
for you.
Oh, there was one other thing...
We found this curious looking
device in your clothes... what
is it?
Oh, it's just a toy I was taking
home... a present...
I thought you didn't have any
family...
For a neighbor's child.
Did they find anything else, I
had one piece of jewelry... a
metal pin...
No, I'm sorry. This was all we
found...
"Genetic irregularities"?... that
thing isn't even the same species
as we are...
Keep your voice down.
The last thing we need is a panic
in here over some...
It's all the space flights...
they've attracted creatures from
outer space...
Now, that's exactly the kind of
thing I don't want to hear ... is
that understood?
What are you going to do?
With all the medical facilities
available, why did he have to end
up here?
I think we ought to call Central
Security.
I'm not calling anybody yet. Not
until we've done a lot more. A
lot more. I want his story
checked out...
Run a complete search through the
medical library... be absolutely
certain there's never been
anything like him...
What if there're more of them?
They could be everywhere...
Somebody get Nilrem a calmative.
We ought to see if we can find
the physician Crusher. And give
this thing...
... to somebody in technical to
check out.
What about him?
Cordon off this wing... I want
security on his door twenty-nine
hours a day... and I want this
kept quiet...
They've already questioned my
judgement on the diagnostic
center, criticized my resource
allocations... all they need to
hear now is that I'm treating
alien creatures...
At twelve-point-four after launch,
the warp field generator will be
activated...
That's when it would break the
light barrier?
Yes, Chancellor. If we're
successful, the craft will leave
our star system in a matter of
minutes and will be on its way
toward the Garth system...
And then what?
And then, Krola, we'll see what's
there...
How long, Mirasta?
We have the prototype design for
the warp engine... it would simply
be a matter of building the
actual production units. If I
get your approval today... ten
months, maybe less.
Chancellor, I'll admit Mirasta's
enthusiasm for her work is
seductive, but perhaps we're
moving too fast...
As fast as the speed of light,
Krola...
Why am I always the only realist
in a room full of dreamers... ?
Please, I must be serious...
there was another demonstration
today... some violence. Your
opponents will see this as another
example of your determination to
pull us further from our
traditional ways...
My opponents look back as I look
forward. I cannot believe that
my people would choose to retreat
after all we've done...
I agree.
The people were willing to accept
your social reforms because they
believe in you, Chancellor. But
there are many who say we have
gone far enough... all of these
new ideas... new technology...
and now space travel... it
confuses them, frightens them...
And I will not allow them to
remain in the dark ages... the
warp program will proceed as you
have outlined, Mirasta...
And then we will slow down, Krola,
to let everyone catch their breath
including you...
Excuse me, Mirasta Yale?
Yes?
My name is Jean-Luc Picard. This
is my associate Deanna Troi. May
we come in?
Who are you?
Please don't be alarmed by our
appearance... we've come with
some... important information.
About what?
About space. About the universe
you are preparing to enter.
We are from a federation of
planets, Mirasta... Captain Picard
is from a planet called Earth more
than two thousand light years from
here. I am from another planet
called Betazed.
Uh huh.
We have been monitoring your
progress toward warp drive
capability. When a society
reaches your level of technology
and is clearly about to initiate
warp travel, we believe it is time
to make first contact. We prefer
meeting like this rather than a
random confrontation in deep
space.
We've come to you first because
you are a leader in the scientific
community. And scientists can
generally accept our arrival more
easily than others.
We almost always encounter fear
and shock on this sort of mission.
We hope you will be able to help
facilitate our introduction.
Is this a joke? Did Lupo and the
others at the lab put you up to
this?
I assure you this is no joke.
You can see we are quite
physically different than
Malcorians.
And with your permission, I am
prepared to prove what I am
saying.
All right...
Picard to Enterprise. Three to
beam up.
Welcome aboard.
It's beyond words... everything
I've ever dreamed about...
When I was a child, my parents
would take me to the
planetarium... and we would sit
in the dark and it was as if I
was on a spaceship on my way to
another world... to meet people
from other planets...
Now that you're about to travel
beyond your own solar system, you
will meet a great many more people
from other planets, Mirasta...
The Federation prefers to make
first contact like this... rather
than a random confrontation in
deep space.
A part of me still expects the
lights to come up as the program
ends...
How did you know about me?
We try to learn as much as
possible about a planet before
first contact.
One of the things we do is monitor
broadcast signals... We listen
to your journalism, your music,
your humor... try to better
understand you as a people...
I hate to think how you would
judge us based on our popular
music and entertainment.
To be sure, we get an incomplete
picture from long distance...
that's why we also do on-surface
reconnaissance.
You've had people on our planet?
For several years.
We've found that the most
hazardous aspect of this kind
of mission is a lack of sufficient
information...
You don't have to explain. I
understand.
But not everyone on my planet
would. They'd think you were
trying to infiltrate our society.
We do have a complication here,
Mirasta. One of our people is
missing. My first officer,
Commander William Riker.
He was on the surface to
coordinate the final details with
our observation team when he
disappeared. Our people have made
inquiries... but we have not been
able to locate him. If there's
any way you can help...
Of course. Where was Riker's last
known location?
The capital city. He was there
under the name of Rivas Jakara,
a tourist from the Marta
community.
We've got to find him before
someone realizes what he really
is... if this gets out prematurely,
it will seriously complicate
matters.
Introducing you to this world
will not be an easy matter.
It never is.
You must already know that my
people are in a transitory
stage... an old staid culture
has been pulled into the future
by Chancellor Durken... but it
is not easy to discard deep-rooted
beliefs. Our entire ideology is
based on the assumption that the
Malcorian is the supreme lifeform
and that our world is the center
of the universe. Your arrival
will change our entire
understanding of life...
Some will not want it to change.
What about Durken?
Durken will be open-minded. But
cautious. I strongly suggest that
you do not discuss your
surveillance teams with him...
not right away at least.
But, with the disappearance of
Commander Riker, wouldn't it be
prudent...
Captain Picard, you must trust
me on this. If you tell the
Chancellor about Commander Riker,
it would undermine everything you
hope to accomplish here.
Durken would assign Krola, the
Minister of Security, to find him.
Krola has his own political
agenda. He will perceive you as
the greatest threat my people have
ever known. And he will not
hesitate to use Riker to prove
he is correct.
It doesn't make sense that he's
the only one... think about it...
From another planet, hundreds of
them... invasion from space...
Somebody said he's not bad
looking... what if that's just
a disguise... meat-eaters... I've
heard he can see through walls...
thousands of them...
I thought I said this was to be
kept a secret...
You know Nilrem...
Well, it's getting out of
control...
... I don't know what else he is,
but he's still a patient in this
medical facility and we have a
responsibility for his care and
recovery... remind them of that,
will you?
Berel, you're not going to be able
to contain this much longer.
I know.
If people get scared enough,
anything could happen...
Mister Jakara, we have been unable
to confirm anything you told us.
No physician named Crusher is on
file... not on this planet...
Your address in Marta is an eating
establishment... the cook has
never heard of Rivas Jakara.
There's obviously been some
misunderstanding...
There's a growing number of people
on the other side of that door
who believe you are not one of
us.
Not one of you... ?
That you're from another planet.
Are you, Mister Jakara?
Do you realize what you're saying?
I know how it sounds. And I am
not anxious to make a fool of
myself.
Mister Jakara, this new era of
space flight, it does fire the
imagination. People see
unidentified vessels in the sky
that turn out to be weather
balloons.
It is far more likely that I'm
a weather balloon than an alien.
Our medical journals have
documented several cases of
genetic mutation in recent
history... some unusual physical
disfigurations have occurred...
I guess I'm another case for the
medical journals then...
Perhaps. But you, Mister Jakara,
are hiding something. Unless you
tell me the truth about yourself,
this rumor will persist and grow
and could even become dangerous.
Most especially to you.
... the delegate from the Central
Province at four-point-three...
the conference with capitol
journalists is at six-point-one...
and Minister Yale of the Space
Bureau would like to introduce
you to someone...
Call her back and see if the
Vice-Chancellor will do...
They're out here waiting to see
you, sir...
All right. Send them in.
Always time to meet your friends,
Mirasta.
Chancellor, please sit down...
you may want to clear your
afternoon schedule for this.
The security chief and a medical
officer are always present during
a first contact transport -- a
matter of policy... we've learned
to expect the unexpected...
Your fortitude is impressive,
Chancellor... my knees buckled
the moment we... we... what do
you call it... ?
"Beamed up"...
Yes, beamed up...
It sounds as though you have done
this quite often.
Personally, I have been involved
with four first contact missions.
And what happened to those other
four planets?
They're still there, Chancellor.
This is their warp drive,
Chancellor. Do you believe it... ?
Our theories were correct...
I can only imagine the sort of
armaments your vessel carries,
Captain Picard.
This vessel also carries families
and children, Chancellor. It is
not a warship. The Federation
is dedicated to the peaceful
exploration of space.
And do you expect all the worlds
you contact to become members
of your federation?
Not at all, Chancellor. Some
desire membership. Some do not.
And in some cases the
philosophical differences are so
great, it is not even a
consideration...
This is my bridge.
Captain.
Mister Data. Allow me to
introduce Chancellor Avel Durken
and Space Administrator Mirasta
Yale.
How do you do?
Data is my Second Officer.
He is an android, Chancellor.
A constructed being.
A machine?
In a manner of speaking. The term
"artificial lifeform" is more
accurate.
Chancellor.
Captain Picard. Is there
somewhere we might speak together?
Without distraction?
Chancellor, with your permission,
I will... beam back to the
surface.
I have several matters to attend
to.
Not a word to anyone about this,
Mirasta.
Of course.
Mister Data will escort you to
the transporter room.
Has there still been no
communication from Commander
Riker, Data?
No, Minister. He has not returned
to our designated transport
coordinates. We have continued
to scan the capitol city without
success.
I've been saving this for a
special occasion. My brother on
Earth produces fruit known as
grapes which he turns into wine.
He's really quite good at it.
We have a tradition, Chancellor,
called a toast... a drink to
salute one's friends and good
fortune. I propose a toast to
a new friendship.
We have something very much like
this here on Malcor Three.
I am sure we will find much in
common.
And much that is not in common.
An opportunity to learn from one
another.
You speak the language of
diplomacy very well, Captain
Picard... it is a language I
appreciate and understand... but
I have learned to not always trust
it...
Trust requires time and
experience...
My world's history has recorded
that conquerors often arrived
with the words, "we are your
friends."
Chancellor, we are not here to
conquer.
What do you want?
Today, all I wish to have is a
drink between friends.
A beginning. How we proceed is
entirely up to you...
And if my wishes conflict with
yours... ?
There will be no conflict.
And if I were to tell you to leave
and never return to my world...
We would leave and never return.
We are only here to help guide
you... into a new era. I assure
you we will not interfere with
the natural development of your
planet... that is, in fact, our
Prime Directive.
I could infer from that directive
that you do not intend to share
all this extraordinary technology
with us...
That is not the whole meaning...
but it is part of it.
Is that your way of maintaining
superiority?
To instantly transform a society
with technology would be harmful
and destructive...
You're right of course.
I am overwhelmed, Captain Picard.
Quite overwhelmed.
I come home each night to a loving
wife and two beautiful
daughters... we eat the evening
meal together as a family, I feel
that's important... and they
always ask me if I've had a good
day.
How shall you answer them tonight,
Chancellor?
Well, I'll have to say... this
morning, I was the leader of the
universe as I knew it... this
afternoon, I am only a voice in
a chorus.
But I think it was a good day.
There are guards out there.
You'll never escape that way.
I'm not afraid of you.
Good. Because there's nothing
to be afraid of...
We shouldn't fear the unknown.
We should embrace it.
Can you help me get out of here?
Are you really an alien? It's
all right to tell me.
No, I'm not an alien...
I don't believe you. You are an
alien.
Listen, I really have to leave...
I could divert the guard's
attention. You might have a
chance if you took the service
exit down the hall to the left...
To the left. All right. Let's
do it.
Why should I?
You know why. Because I don't
belong here. Because I have to
get back to my ship in space.
I believe you.
Now, will you help me?
If you make love to me.
What?
I've always wanted to make love
with an alien.
Listen, Miss...
Lanel...
I really have to get going... all
the... other aliens are expecting
me...
It's not so much to ask. And then
I'll help you escape.
It's not that easy. There are...
differences... in the way my
people make love.
I can't wait to learn.
But...
It's your only way out of here...
my alien...
Something's happened to him...
I think he's dead... hurry, go
get help...
Okay...
Will I ever see you again... ?
I'll call you next time I'm
passing through your star system.
Hey!
Stop him! Somebody stop him!
He's escaping! The alien's
escaping!
He's loose! Get him! Don't let
him get away! Kill him! Stop
him! Where's he going? He's
dangerous! Block the exits!
Knock him down! Kill him!
Leave him alone!
Stop it! All of you! Stop it
now!
Have you all lost your minds?
They've aggravateded the injury
to his telencephalin... he's
bleeding internally...
Get him into a surgical cubicle...
And call Central Security. This
has gone too far.
Recommendation?
I don't know... it doesn't match
anything...
Forget your training. What do
you see?
The ichor pooling under the
cranial bone... it seems to be
exerting abnormal pressure.
Ordinarily, I'd say we have
to drill to relieve it.
Agreed.
Suction...
Three-point-six aspiration drill.
I wonder what his own kind would
do for him...
I have to believe it'd be better
than this...
Their leader, Picard, has made
it clear that how we proceed is
entirely our own decision...
You cannot possibly be suggesting
surrender, Chancellor...
They are not hostile...
Mirasta, you are incredibly naive.
Can you be so enraptured with the
notion of space travellers that
you are blind to the threat they
represent... ?
I have seen their vessel, Krola...
if they chose to be hostile, I
don't think we would be standing
here now...
Why should they use force when
we are ready to lay down in
fear...
I do not lay down in fear... to
them or to you, Krola.
Chancellor, I mean no disrespect.
But I have repeatedly warned you
about your policies... taking us
so quickly where we had no
business going in the first
place... New philosophies, new
economics, new technologies.
There are many people who still
value our traditional way of
life... and I for one am willing
to die to defend it.
Open your eyes, Krola. We are
part of a greater community now.
We cannot ignore it.
You would ignore them... as they
infiltrate and spy on us...
What are you saying, Krola?
We have captured one of their
spies.
Chancellor, he is Captain Picard's
first officer, Commander Riker.
You knew about this?
He has been missing for two days.
I told Captain Picard not to
discuss it because I was afraid
this is exactly what would
happen...
What else do you know, Mirasta?
Everything.
They've been on our planet,
observing us for several years...
Years... Imagine what they have
done... influenced our young,
stirred up dissent...
They were collecting
information...
Where is this Commander Riker now?
You will not discuss this with
Picard or the other aliens. If
you are not comfortable with that,
Mirasta, you may leave now.
He is at the Sikla Medical
facility, recovering from
surgery... he suffered head
injuries in an attempt to escape.
He will recover consciousness in
a few hours.
Will he survive?
I didn't think he would have
survived the injuries. The real
question is can he survive the
treatment..
I have to interrogate him before
he dies.
At least give him time to regain
some strength. Come back
tomorrow.
It cannot wait until tomorrow.
Krola, we can get help from his
ship. With their medical
technology, he might recover.
We're not giving him back. He
is the one advantage we have now.
Use your drugs to revive him...
Those drugs increase cardial rate
and vascular pressure... that's
the last thing we want to do to
him right now...
It will probably be enough to kill
him... you can't do it...
Revive him.
I'm just a physician, Minister.
I don't know much about affairs
of state. But he is a living,
intelligent being. I don't care
if the Chancellor himself calls
down here. I have sworn an oath
to do no harm. And I will not.
Then I will find someone to
replace you.
He won't have any trouble finding
someone, you know.
Chancellor...
You are punctual, Captain.
I know how busy you are.
Do you?
I think you know a great deal more
about me than I know about you.
In what respect?
I can't know what motivates you...
how you make decisions... what
value you place on life... you
speak of trust and peace and
working together to enter a new
era... at the same time you
conduct secret surveillance...
posing as Malcorians...
Commander Riker.
Commander Riker.
Mirasta felt it would be a
mistake to discuss...
Yes, she's tried to accept the
responsibility.
You're right. It was my error,
not hers.
Chancellor, no starship mission
is more dangerous than first
contact. We never know what we
face when we open the door to a
new world. How will we be
greeted? What are the dangers?
Centuries ago, a disastrous first
contact with the Klingon Empire
led to decades of war. It was
decided then that we must do
surveillance before making
contact. It was a controversial
decision. But I believe it
prevents more problems than it
creates.
I appreciate the logic of your
position, Captain. But it would
seem a full disclosure after
contact would have been in order.
In time, there would have been
full disclosure. I know I can
only ask you to believe that.
On some worlds, it is not even
an issue. But here, everything
our observers reported suggested
the people of this world would
almost certainly react negatively
to our arrival. We could see
our surveillance might even be
interpreted as an act of
aggression.
I was hoping that we would find
Commander Riker before you did...
so the matter would not
complicate our introduction. And
it was a mistake.
A mistake I might have made in
your place.
I rather like it actually.
Like it?
That you make mistakes like any
man.
Oh, I've made some fine ones in
my time.
Will you release my officer?
We'll talk again later, Captain.
Enterprise, one to beam up.
Yes I understand.
I've been relieved of my duties...
as I'm sure you already know.
You are acting director of the
facility, Nilrem.
Revive him.
Leave us.
I am Minister Krola from Internal
Security. You are Riker, an
alien...
Yes, we know.
Please. Bring my people here.
In time. In time. But first,
I need to ask you some
questions...
Thank you for seeing me.
If I did not depend so much on
your expertise in space matters,
I would have asked for your
resignation.
I felt I was acting in the best
interests of our people,
Chancellor.
When you are selected to occupy
this office, then you'll have the
privilege of deciding the best
interests of our people.
Picard, I can excuse. But you,
Mirasta, you should have trusted
me.
Chancellor -- we must release
Riker to Picard... Any hope for
a relationship with these people
depends on it...
I cannot afford to be the idealist
you are, Mirasta.
Riker...
I am prepared to release Riker
after we've interrogated him...
Are you prepared for him to die,
Chancellor?
His injuries are extremely
serious. A mob at the medical
facility almost killed him. Krola
has ordered drugs to be used to
revive him for questioning, drugs
that are dangerous in his
condition. Without medical aid
from his ship, I believe Riker
will not survive the day. You
must tell Picard where he is.
You have lied since the moment
of your capture... and I believe
you are lying now, Commander.
We... are here on a mission of
peace...
Such noble creatures.
Why do peaceful people develop
such lethal weapons?
Or do you still insist it is a
toy?
Yes, my experts were able to make
it function. An interesting toy
to be sure.
It is... for defense...
Perhaps, like many conquerors,
you believe your goals to be
benevolent. I cannot. For
however you would describe your
intentions, you still represent
the end to my way of life. I
cannot permit that to occur.
Eventually, Durken would choose
to welcome your people with arms
open and eyes closed. I must
force him down another path.
When they find us, I will be dead,
killed by your weapon. The lines
will be drawn. A peaceful accord
will no longer be an option.
No...
For my people.
Captain, Chancellor Durken has
requested your immediate presence
on the surface. It's in regard
to Commander Riker.
Acknowledged, Lieutenant.
Life signs failing on one...
... he's dying, Nilrem... you
can't just stand here... or can
you... ?
What... ?
He shot him. The alien shot
Krola...
I'm a physician... don't be
frightened...
What happened?
The... he shot him...
with that thing...
Crusher to Picard.
Go ahead, Doctor.
Commander Riker is near death.
But there is still brain
activity... I've got to take
him back to the ship...
Acknowledged.
Minister Krola has a phaser wound
in his upper chest.
I should take him with us.
We'll meet you on the
Enterprise.
Enterprise, five to beam up...
directly to Sickbay...
energize...
They're both going to be okay...
we were able to stabilize Will...
if we'd been any later...
Krola?
He was never in any real danger...
the phaser was on stun...
Stun?
It is a defensive weapon. We do
not use it to kill.
Have you been able to ascertain
what happened?
I have a good idea. Based on the
angle of impact... it suggests
that Krola had his right hand on
the phaser when it went off...
They were struggling for the
weapon?
Commander Riker was in no position
to offer any kind of struggle,
Chancellor.
Krola was trying to be a
martyr... ?
Where is this?
You are aboard the starship, my
foolish old friend.
No. Chancellor... you must not...
you must not pursue relations with
them... you must not...
I know. I know.
But Chancellor...
Mirasta, it goes against every
instinct in my being...
... but my people are not ready
to accept what you represent.
Everything that happened at the
hospital proves it. Krola is the
best evidence of all. We must
slow down and allow all those like
him to join us in the present
before we move into the future.
But when we encounter other beings
in space, our people must be
ready...
The warp program will have to be
delayed... we will divert more
resources into education and
social development to prepare for
the day when we are ready.
Chancellor, I strongly disagree.
I know.
Captain Picard, you once said that
if I ask you to leave, you would
without hesitation. I'm afraid
I must ask you to do just that.
It is your decision, Chancellor.
But I must say I regret that we
won't have the opportunity of
knowing your people better.
We are a good people, Captain.
A society with much potential.
Once we cross this threshold of
space, we will have to give up
the self-importance, the conceit
that we are the center of the
universe.
But this is not the time. For
now, it is better that we continue
to enjoy that sweet innocence.
But how can you keep us a
secret... when so many have seen
and heard so much?
The stories will be told for many
years, I have no doubt... of the
ship that made contact... of an
alien who was held prisoner in
a medical facility... there will
be charges of a government
cover-up... some of the witnesses
will tell their tales and most
people will laugh at them and go
back and watch more interesting
fiction on the daily broadcasts.
It will pass.
I'm sorry to say... he's probably
right.
Captain, I have one last
request... take me with you.
She will be unhappy with the
restrictions I must place on her
at home, Captain.
We may not be back in your
lifetime. And I have to believe
that you are not fully prepared
for the risks of space, Mirasta...
I have been prepared for the risks
of space since I was nine years
old sitting in a planetarium.
Mister Worf, to my Ready Room...
Escort Chancellor Durken to the
transporter room, Lieutenant...
and then assign quarters to
Minister Yale. She'll be staying
on board.
Aye, sir.
Until we return then...
With luck, we will both still
be around to renew our friendship,
Captain.
