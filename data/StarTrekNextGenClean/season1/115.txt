Captain's log, stardate 41636.9.
As feared, our examination of the
seven year overdue Federation
freighter, Odin -- disabled by
an asteroid collision -- revealed
no survivors.
However, three escape pods were
missing, suggesting the
possibility of survivors...
Ready to begin orbit of Angel One,
Captain.
Make it so, Mister LaForge. What
kind of place is this, Data?
Angel One is a class M planet,
supporting carbon-based flora and
fauna, sparsely populated with
intelligent life forms... similar
in technological development to
mid-twentieth-century Earth.
Just like being marooned at home.
Assuming any survivors made it
this far. Admittedly, it's the
closest planet to the Odin. But
the distance we've traveled in the
past two days at warp one would've
taken the Odin escape pods five
months.
Five months, fourteen days, eleven
hours, two minutes --
Thank you, Data.
-- and fifty-seven seconds.
Captain, we're receiving an audio
signal from Angel One.
Starfleet was quite adamant that
we maintain excellent diplomatic
relations with this planet. Any
other pertinent information before
we reply, Mister Data? Their form
of government would be a logical
starting place.
Angel One has evolved into a
constitutional oligarchy. It is
governed by a parliamentary body
consisting of six elected
Mistresses, and headed by a female
they refer to as "The Elected
One."
It sounds very much like my own
planet.
Klingons appreciate strong women.
How current is your information,
Data?
A Federation vessel last visited
this planet sixty-two years ago,
Captain.
Except, let us hope, for the Odin
escape pods.
Since this is a female-dominated
society, it might be more prudent
if you made the initial contact,
Counselor.
Please open hailing frequencies.
Hailing frequencies open.
This is Counselor Deanna Troi of
the USS Enterprise.
I am Beata, The Elected One. How
may we assist you, Counselor?
The Federation has neglected a
visit to your planet for far too
long. With your permission, we
would like to correct that
oversight.
We feel in no way neglected,
Counselor. A diplomatic courtesy
call is neither expected nor
required.
We also come in search of possible
survivors from one of our
freighters.
A brief visit will be tolerated.
They've broken off transmission.
Ever feel like you're not really
wanted?
That's their prerogative,
Lieutenant.
Prepare the away team, Number One.
Aye, aye, sir.
Where're you boys off to?
Skiing, sir. Our instructor has
us scheduled for the Swiss Alps,
sir.
Save us some deep powder.
No problem, sir. The Holodeck
has all you'll ever need.
The away team is ready, Captain.
Angel One's position in this
quadrant may become strategically
vital. The hope at Starfleet is
that some day this planet could
become a part of the Federation.
We'll try to make a good impression,
Captain.
Energize!
See that these matters are handled
immediately.
As you wish, Mistress.
I am Beata, The Elected One of
Angel One.
Mistress Beata, I am Counselor
Troi.
We've brought you a small token
of our goodwill.
My cooperation is not for sale,
Counselor.
We didn't mean to imply that it
was, Mistress.
Out of respect to your wishes that
we keep our visit brief, perhaps
you would like to address the
issue of survivors immediately.
Immediately -- but not
impetuously. You will present
your case.
Until I am certain of your
intentions, I know of no such
survivors.
Representatives of the Starship
Enterprise -- do you wish to
petition the Parliament of Angel
One?
We do. We have reason to hope
that survivors from a damaged
Federation freighter may be
marooned on your planet. We are
seeking to learn if this is so.
Even a planet as remote as Angel
One has heard of Starfleet.
Searching the galaxy for survivors
seems a petty task for one of their
mighty vessels.
We don't consider even one
survivor petty.
Is this man suggesting that we
place a lesser value on life than
you do?
Not at all.
Our discovery of the abandoned
freighter was an accident,
Mistress Beata. We have a duty
to investigate.
I see. And if you were to find
survivors? What then?
We will take them with us. See
that they are reunited with their
families.
Mistress Beata... ?
Yes, Ariel?
Are we to take these strangers
at their word?
A good question.
What reason could we possibly have
to deceive you?
Another good question.
Are there survivors from the
freighter Odin on this planet?
After we discuss that matter,
we'll let you know.
See to their comforts.
You will remain here until
summoned.
Are we able to talk? Is the
area secure?
Yes. Tricorder doesn't show
any listening devices or
anything else of a threatening
nature
Good. Troi?
There was much fear in that room.
Paranoia, if you ask me. But of
what?
I cannot say. Nor do I feel their
fear was focused. I sensed that
all were not concerned for the
same reason.
Data?
There are undoubtedly survivors
from the Odin on this planet,
Commander.
I agree. Otherwise, why would
they be so circumspect?
As the Mistress Beata is so fond
of saying -- good question.
What do we do if they elect to
deny the existence of any
survivors?
Let's not look for problems.
I want all departments prepared
for a warp six trip to the Neutral
Zone as soon as the away team
completes its mission.
Trouble, Captain?
Insurance. Romulan battlecruisers
have been detected near one of
our border posts. They've
requested assistance as soon as
we are available.
Captain Picard!
Report, Mister Crusher.
We, ah, finished our ski lesson,
sir... and it kinda just happened,
sir.
On the Enterprise, Mister Crusher,
nothing "just happens."
What is that smell?
Hmm, yes... slightly reminiscent
of Night-Blooming Throgni,
Captain. From home.
Quite stimulating, wouldn't you
say?
No.
I can't smell anything. I'm
a little congested...
Don't let this "just happen"
again, Mister Crusher.
Yes, sir!!
Interesting. An alcohol-based
synthetic, artificially
reproducing a floral scent.
It is called perfume, Data.
The purpose of which is... ?
Certain cultures consider perfume
an aphrodisiac.
I am unfamiliar with that term.
An aphrodisiac is something
designed to stimulate or enhance
sexual pleasure.
How does stimulation of the
olfactory nerve affect the
enjoyment of sex?
The Elected One will see you now.
You claim you intend to remove
these survivors from our planet.
Are you prepared to give us your
solemn word on that?
We are.
You should know that the vote was
not unanimous. Some among us are
suspicious.
Yet, the majority feel that we
have no choice but to trust you.
We don't understand the source
of your misgivings, Mistress, but
we appreciate your faith in us.
Make certain that our faith has
not been misplaced.
There are four survivors from the
ship you call the Odin. All male.
Their leader is a man who calls
himself Ramsey.
If you'll bring these men to us,
we'll have them off your planet
immediately.
If they were mine to deliver, I
would do so without hesitation.
Unfortunately, their hiding place
has long eluded us.
Hiding place? Why are they in
hiding?
Because they are fugitives on
Angel One! And the sooner we are
rid of them, the better!
When these men arrived seven years
ago, they accepted our hospitality
quickly enough. But gradually,
they grew restive. Making
unreasonable demands, going
against the natural order -- there
seemed to be no end to the trouble
they created.
Using the technology of the
Enterprise, we might be able to
find these men.
I assumed as much. But be warned,
Counselor --
-- these men are dangerous.
This is worse than Hesperan
Thumping Cough. What is it, Mom?
You and your friend probably
picked up something on the Quazulu
Eight field trip last week.
Whatever it is may have been
activated by your exposure to the
cold ski environment of the
Holodeck.
But the transporter biofilter is
supposed to kill stuff like that.
If this is our first contact, it
wouldn't have been programmed into
the biofilter computer yet.
Mom...
Sickbay to Captain Picard.
Picard here.
Wesley and one of his friends have
contracted some form of
respiratory ailment -- most likely
a viral infection.
Is it contained?
I believe so. I've isolated the
twelve students who were on the
field trip where I believe the
problem began.
How contagious is it?
Unknown. Nor do I have a clue
as to how it's transmitted.
Please stay with it, Doctor.
Starfleet has important business
for us as soon as the away team
returns. I don't relish having my
crew infected.
At the moment, my only suggestion
is that all crew avoid any
cold-weather Holodeck simulations
until further notice.
Agreed. And keep me advised.
Data, how can we best go about
finding Mister Ramsey and the
other survivors?
Assuming the survivors have
retained some remnants of their
lives aboard the Odin, we might
not have a difficult task. If
we can isolate something unique
to the survivors -- perhaps an
element not otherwise found on
Angel One -- we can utilize the
Enterprise scanners.
Mister Data will need access to
your library.
Our library is far too
sophisticated for a man to
comprehend.
I am an android, Mistress, though
anatomically, I am a fully
functioning male.
An amusing notion. Perhaps you
could teach our males a thing or
two.
Trent -- see to the android's
needs.
Do not forget your promise.
Bridge to Captain Picard.
Go ahead, Lieutenant.
The away team has requested that
we scan the planet surface for
traces of platinum.
Have Mister LaForge break fixed
orbit and initiate a search
pattern.
Aye, Captain.
Geordi.
Search pattern initiated now.
This is all quite unnecessary,
Doctor.
I'm merely fatigued.
Because you are very ill, Captain.
You have the virus.
Captain, in my opinion, you are
no longer physically able to
effectively command this vessel.
Don't be ridiculous, Doctor. I've
got an away team down there, in
less-than-friendly territory, not
to mention an appointment with the
several Romulan battlecruisers...
You have an appointment in your
cabin, Captain. With your bed.
Is that an order?
Yes.
I guess I'm better at giving
orders than taking them.
I think I may sneeze...
A Klingon sneeze?!
Only kind I know.
Lieutenant LaForge -- you have
command until further notice.
Please make the proper entries
in the ship's log.
Aye, sir.
Scanners indicate a platinum
trace. Should I notify the away
team?
Make it so.
The Enterprise reports a possible
location for Mister Ramsey and
the other survivors.
So soon? I'm impressed with your
haste.
I am suspicious of it.
You've had your opportunity to
object, Ariel. You were in the
minority.
Excuse me, Mistress. I have
matters to attend to elsewhere.
With your permission, we'd like
to begin our search immediately.
By all means.
But I'm sure that Counselor Troi
and the others can do that without
you.
If I recall, you had a gesture
of goodwill you wished to give
me... ?
That can certainly wait until
we've recovered the survivors.
Are you suggesting that the women
in your party are incapable of
performing this task without the
help of a man?
Not at all. Lieutenant Yar and
Counselor Troi are completely
qualified.
How generous you are with your
praise.
Inform them you will remain here
with me.
Riker to Lieutenant Yar.
This is Yar.
Tasha - you'll be leading the team
without me.
Commander... ?
In the interest of diplomatic
relations, I'll remain with
Mistress Beata while you conduct
your search.
Certainly, sir.
Relax. We have much to discuss.
Set phasers to stun.
Is that really necessary?
A justified precaution, Counselor.
Mistress Beata observed that
Mister Ramsey and his men were
dangerous.
Lieutenant Yar to Enterprise.
Go ahead, Tasha.
Three to beam to the location of
that platinum trace, Geordi.
Coordinates set.
Energize!
Welcome. I've been expecting you.
Picard to bridge.
Pardon me.
LaForge here, Captain.
Status report, please.
Eighty-two more reported cases
of the virus, sir. Doctor Crusher
has converted the Holodeck into
an isolation ward.
And the --
-- away team?
No recent contact, Captain. But
I've informed them of the medical
situation up here and the growing
Romulan threat to our Neutral Zone
outpost.
Keep me--
--advised. You'll have the bridge
until Commander Riker returns.
Engineering reports a computer
malf...
Sorry, I'm... getting sick.
I'm sure half the ship knows that
by now. Report to Sickbay.
Engineering to bridge.
LaForge here.
Sir, the computer won't accept
the variant climate controls
Doctor Crusher wants in the
quarantine areas.
I'm on my way.
With all respect, Lieutenant,
there are other people to do that
job now.
bridge to Engineering. Lieutenant
Wong knows the system. I'm sure
she'll be able to resolve all
problems.
I'll ask her to look at it right
away, sir.
Worf...
Thanks for the advice.
We haven't much time, Mister
Ramsey. The Enterprise has urgent
business elsewhere.
Certainly we have time for a
drink.
How did you find me?
Actually, it was quite simple.
I accessed all possible elements
available to the crew of the Odin,
cross-referenced those to elements
endemic to Angel One, then
eliminated the common
denominators. Angel One has no
platinum. Enterprise scanners
did the rest.
Platinum, was it?
My wings. I kept them for their
sentimental value.
Where are the other survivors,
Mister Ramsey?
Oh, they're nearby. Packing, as
a matter of fact, since we can
no longer remain here. As the
unofficial leader of our little
group, I've been chosen to speak
for us all.
Marooned seven years on an alien
planet. Rather than excitement
or anticipation at being rescued,
I sense a feeling of calm in you.
What is it you think you're
rescuing me from? My shipmates
and I have all taken wives. A
few even have children. You can't
"rescue" a man from the place he
calls his home.
... Why were you so hesitant at
first to tell us about the Odin
survivors?
Simply because Ramsey and his men
are anarchists. Tampering with
the laws of nature. Obsessed with
spreading untruths, and
encouraging dissent among our
people. I had to be certain you
weren't here to fuel their
struggle.
It's not our place to interfere
in the domestic affairs of other
societies.
Not you, perhaps, because you
understand a man's place. But
Ramsey is not so well-mannered.
Sometimes I fear that it is
actually the men who are the
clever ones, enjoying all that
life has to offer while we women
devote ourselves to the drudgery
of making life work.
In our society, men and women
share equally in all that life
has to offer.
Don't misunderstand me, Riker.
I'd be the last to imply that men
are in any way inferior to women.
But, after all, men are... men --
with a natural place in the scheme
of things.
We gave up those distinctions
centuries ago. In our world,
equality among the sexes is so
well established, we no longer
consider it an issue.
You deny that differences exist
between men and women?
We not only acknowledge the
differences. We delight in them.
That's so like a man. So
emotional. What would we do
without you... ?
Thank you, Trent.
You may go.
With compliments of the USS
Enterprise.
It's called an Albeni meditation
crystal.
Very impressive.
And now, of course, I must repay
you in kind.
... Five months in a rescue pod
no bigger than this room is an
eternity I hope none of you ever
have to face. When we finally
made it here, we all thought we'd
died and gone to heaven. You've
seen the women of the planet --
tall and strong and lovely.
But once the newness wore off,
we started to see how men on this
planet were treated. No vote,
no opinions... no respect.
None of which is any longer your
concern, Mister Ramsey. Call the
others in, please. It's time to
leave.
Despite its problems, Lieutenant,
we like it here on Angel One.
We're not going anywhere.
But Mistress Beata --
Mistress Beata be damned! Her
wish is not my command. And
neither is yours. You can't force
us to go.
Mister Ramsey is correct,
Counselor. The Odin was not a
starship, which means its crew
is not bound by the Prime
Directive. If he and the other
survivors wish to stay here, there
is absolutely nothing we can do.
Bridge to Sickbay -- how are you
Doing, Doctor?
We have more sick than we do beds.
I've been forced to confine over
three hundred to their private
quarters.
We're going to be seriously
undermanned if we're forced to
engage the Romulans in battle.
The Romulans are your problem,
Lieutenant. Trying to find an
innoculant is mine. This virus
mutates every twenty minutes.
On the positive side, the virus
is debilitating -- but so far we
haven't had any fatalities.
If this continues, there'll be
no one left to run the ship.
If it continues, no one will be
healthy enough to care.
Lieutenant Yar to Enterprise.
Enterprise, go ahead.
Prepare to beam three back to our
previous location, Geordi. After
we regroup with Commander Riker,
we'll return to the ship.
Suggest you make that on the
double. We have a real medical
emergency brewing up here. A
third of the crew is down. And
the latest report from the Neutral
Zone outpost is that more Romulan
battlecrusiers are entering the
area.
I'll inform the commander.
One thing before we go. You said
you were expecting us. Why?
I'm sorry. I can't tell you.
We wish you well, Mister Ramsey.
Energize!
They are gone.
It is such a refreshing change
to be with a man who knows what
he wants.
You mean without a woman having
to tell him?
Exactly! I knew you were bright
enough to understand. Women, by
our very nature, want only what
is best for their men.
Men are not objects to be
possessed, Mistress Beata.
Of course they're not. It was
merely a figure of speech.
Enter.
Why do you bother me?
Forgive the disturbance, Elected
One...
I expect so little from this sorry
excuse for a man. Perhaps even
that much is too much...
What is so important you find it
necessary to intrude on my
privacy?
They have returned, Mistress.
But without Ramsey or the others.
Your advanced technology has
proven inadequate?
What happened, Troi?
Mister Ramsey and the other
survivors refuse to leave.
But you promised!
I'm sorry. There's nothing else
we can do.
I am sorry as well.
Since you refuse to take them with
you, I am left with no choice...
but to sentence them all to death.
Enter.
It looks horrible, tastes worse --
but it's absolutely guaranteed to
make you feel better.
Knew you'd like it.
New cologne?
Same... you gave me last birthday.
Uh-uh, different. Like something
I smelled earlier. Something...
I don't know... like a flower I
remember. Something Klingon, I
think.
Lieutenant Worf and I... detected
a similar scent when we bumped
into... your son at the Holodeck.
It's that smell! That must be
how the virus travels!
An airborne microbe whose sweet
scent inspires deep inhalation...
... And once inside the body,
becomes this damned virus!
I have a great deal of work to
do.
You are excused, Doctor.
What's the latest on the
Enterprise's medical situation?
Doctor Crusher feels the virus
will undoubtedly run unchecked
through the entire ship's
contingent. Attempts to develop
an innoculant have so far ended
in failure. Lieutenant LaForge
still has the Conn pending your
return.
What about the Romulans in the
Neutral Zone?
The border outpost reports a
contingent of seven Romulan
battlecruisers within sensor
range. The USS Berlin has
answered their distress call, and
is standing by. However, should
hostilities erupt, the outpost
and the starship will be
outgunned. It is felt that the
Enterprise's presence in the area
will be a vital show of force.
Some show of force. The
Enterprise may be able to fly on
autopilot. But with that virus
knocking down our crew, we're
going to be in sorry shape if
things turn ugly.
The Romulans won't know our
strength, Lieutenant.
It's time for us to leave this
place.
It feels terribly wrong to leave
while Beata is determined to
execute those people.
She has to find them first.
Ramsey and his bunch have been
fugitives for years. I suspect
he's pretty good at evading
capture. As cold as it sounds
we're going to have to treat this
mission as if it never happened.
Everything will remain exactly
as it was before we arrived.
Something is wrong.
Your presence on Angel One no
longer amuses me.
Amusement was never our intention,
Mistress.
Before you go back to your ship,
there is something I wish you to
see.
We were no harm to anyone. Why
did you tell them where to find
us?
Don't blame them, Ramsey. You
brought this upon yourself.
You... and the traitor.
One doesn't need the technology
of the Enterprise to follow
Mistress Ariel sneaking off to
warn her husband.
Let her stand with him now...
... For tomorrow they will die
together.
You're out of commission, Geordi.
Report to your quarters.
Can't leave my post... until I'm
relieved.
I've been aboard the Enterprise
long enough to know she's designed
to run herself.
But the innoculant --
I can do my research on the
computers here.
Then I can convalesce here.
You claim to be an advanced
society, yet you resort to tyranny
and executions in order to
suppress those who don't share
your views.
I don't expect you to understand.
Why? Because I'm only a man?
You'll accomplish nothing with
that attitude.
Mistress Beata, if you could avoid
executing Ramsey and his
followers, would you do so?
Is that not the way of an advanced
society?
Then let us talk to men from the
Odin one last time. Let me try
to convince them to leave with
us.
But what of the others? Their
minds have been poisoned. Will
you also include those from this
planet who unwisely chose to
follow Ramsey and his group?
Yes. All of them.
Mistress Beata is giving you a
second chance. We're prepared
to take your entire group with
us.
That's very kind of you, sir, but
we're not going.
Haven't you been paying attention,
Ramsey? You're scheduled to be
executed tomorrow.
We don't want to die. We don't
want to leave, either. I'm not
Academy educated, but I've studied
a little history. The ancient
Christians faced their lions, the
natives of the African continent
faced their suppressors.
Even the women of the twentieth century
chose to settle for nothing but
full equality.
There's no time to debate the
issues, Ramsey. We're taking you
with us whether you choose to go
or not.
Excuse me, Commander, but removing
any of these people against their
will would be a violation of
several Starfleet regulations,
not the least of which would be
the Prime Directive.
I realize that, Data.
But I'd rather be facing a court
martial than trying to live with
the guilt of leaving these people
to their deaths.
Commander Riker to Enterprise.
This is the Enterprise.
Things must be worse up there than
we thought.
Doctor, where is Lieutenant La
Forge?
He's right here, Will, but he's
in no shape to be here.
We're on our way, Doctor.
There'll be fourteen to beam up.
Two groups, five each. I'll be
in the last group of four.
I'm afraid I can't allow that,
Will. The virus is totally out
of control. Until I know exactly
what I'm dealing with, I can't
let anyone new be exposed.
There are people facing certain
death down here, Doctor.
They could well be facing the same
thing up here, Will. I have no
idea what effect living on Angel
One might have on a person's
immune system. I'm sorry.
Understood.
Doctor -- would this virus have
any effect on Data?
None that I can imagine.
You're going back alone, Data.
We have no idea what the Romulans
plan to do to that outpost.
You're going to have to get the
Enterprise to the Neutral Zone
before it's too late.
That's a direct order, Mister Data.
Neutral Zone before it is too
late. Understood, Commander.
This is Data, standing by to beam
up.
And what of them?
I don't know, Deanna.
Mistress Beata invites you to
witness this morning's
reaffirmation of Angel One's moral
imperative.
Is that supposed to be the fancy
name for murder on this planet?
Send Mistress Beata our regrets.
The Elected One will not look
fondly upon --
Enterprise to Commander Riker.
They are still here?
This is Commander Riker.
I gave you a direct order to head
for the Neutral Zone immediately.
Explain the delay.
To be precise, Commander, you
ordered me to reach the Neutral
Zone "before it is too late."
I have computed the length of time
the border outpost and USS Berlin
can safely withstand a Romulan
attack... deducted our time to
destination at maximum warp speed.
That leaves Doctor Crusher with
forty-eight more minutes to
complete her research and develop
an innoculant to the virus.
Which means there's still time
for us to do something.
Forty-eight minutes... I think
we're down to splitting hairs.
Splitting hairs is a figure of
speech I recognize, Commander.
Speaking for those whose hair is
soon to be split, forty-eight
minutes may make a great deal of
difference.
Excuse me -- forty-seven minutes.
Perhaps, Data, just perhaps.
Thanks for following my orders
so precisely, Data. Riker out.
On second thought, Trent, we would
be honored to watch your moral
imperative in action.
Sickbay to bridge.
Go ahead, Doctor.
Bingo, Data.
Bingo? I fail to see the
relevance, Doctor. Is that not
a reference to an ancient Earth
game?
It's also a reference to success,
Data. I've got the innoculant.
Excellent, Doctor. And we still
have a margin of seventeen
minutes. I will inform the away
team immediately.
Enterprise to Commander Riker.
We are ready to have you beamed
up, Commander.
Data, I want you to lock the
transporter on the holding area
where they're keeping Ramsey and
the others. If we don't hear from
Beata in the next ten minutes,
you are to begin the beam up
sequence, five at a time. The
away team will beam up last.
Understood, Commander. Enterprise
out.
The Elected One wishes to see you.
Welcome home.
It's good to be back. Is everyone
recovering?
Slowly... but yes.
Enter.
How are you feeling, sir?
On the mend, thank you. Tell me
about Angel One.
Set coordinates for the Neutral
Zone, Mister Data. We have a call
to pay on the Romulans.
Coordinates set, Commander. On
your mark --
As Captain Picard would say --
make it so, Mister Data.
