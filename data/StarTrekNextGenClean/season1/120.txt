			Captain! Communication from
			Starfleet. They have recorded
			a disturbance in the Neutral Zone.
			What is the nature of the
			disturbance?
			A battle. Quadrant nine --
			coordinates zero-seven-zero, mark
			three. No information who is
			involved. They are asking if we
			can investigate.
			Answer "affirmative."
			Lieutenant LaForge, lay in the
			course.
			Captain, I have no reports of any
			Federation ships in that area.
			Ferengi?
			It's a little out of their area.
			Should we separate the saucer?
			Let's get some more information
			first.
			Course set.
			Speed -- warp seven.
			Warp seven. Aye.
			Engage.
			We are approaching the Neutral
			Zone.
			Sir... Sensors indicate several
			recent photon explosions and heavy
			phaser activity.
			I have analyzed the residue of
			the explosives. They are not of
			any known Ferengi design. It is
			possibly Romulan.
			That's a name we haven't heard
			for a while.
			And I could have gone a lot longer
			without hearing it.
			If the Romulans have returned to
			this sector we should know about
			it.
			Shall we move to the Battle
			bridge?
			Not yet. Worf, any further
			activity?
			Negative, sir.
			Slow to half impulse.
			Slowing to one-half impulse.
			Entering quadrant nine-zero-seven,
			mark three.
			Shields and deflectors up.
			I have located a ship. It is
			drifting.
			On the Main Viewer.
			Aye, sir.
			Magnify!
			The life-support systems on the
			ship are failing, propulsion,
			navigation, and all
			communication, inoperative.
			Any trace of the other ship?
			None, sir.
			If it is a Romulan vessel, it
			could be cloaked.
			Send this to Starfleet. We are
			entering the Neutral Zone.
			Get us in a little closer, Mister
			LaForge. Stay sharp everyone.
			It's Talarian.
			Any life signs?
			Nothing yet.
			I have identified the vessel.
			It is the Batris. A general
			cargo vessel.
			Long way from home.
			Stay sharp. If this is a result
			of a Romulan attack, they could
			still be in the area.
			Captain. Possible life signs.
			What do you mean "possible?"
			I cannot be positive. The
			readings emanate from a location
			near what is left of Main
			Engineering. There is a great
			deal of magnetic and radioactive
			clutter making a positive
			determination difficult.
			I'll prepare an away team.
			Lieutenant Yar, remain at your
			post. Whoever attacked the
			freighter may still be in the
			area.
			Aye, sir.
			Data, Geordi. Let's go.
			Lieutenant LaForge, are we close
			enough to use the Visual Acuity
			transmitter?
			We can try it, sir.
			Then please do. And Number One -
			everything about this seems wrong.
			Agreed. It smells like a trap.
			Captain's log, stardate 41503.7.
			We have entered the Neutral Zone.
			A Talarian freighter has been
			severely damaged in a battle.
			Why, and with whom is unknown.
			Personal note: I hope this event
			is not a precursor of things to
			come, and that the peace which
			has endured for the last several
			decades will continue.
			What exactly does that device do?
			Data and I have been working on
			a way to transmit what my VISOR
			sees. If it works, the bridge
			will be able to monitor us.
			It is very restricted. The signal
			from Geordi's VISOR is so complex
			that it is difficult to encode
			and breaks down easily.
			That means it doesn't have much
			range.
			Correct. The effective range is
			a few kilometers, but we're
			working on that.
			Bridge, this is Lieutenant La
			Forge.
			This is the bridge.
			I have attached the Visual Acuity
			Transmitter.
			We are receiving.
			I am switching off.
			Set phasers on stun.
			Let's be ready for anything.
			Energize.
			LaForge to Enterprise.
			This is the Enterprise.
			Captain, I am switching on the
			transmitter.
			Ready to receive.
			Put this on the Main Viewer.
			Extraordinary.
			I understand him better than I
			ever have.
			Geordi. What was that? Over to
			the left.
			What?
			That -- right there? No -- back.
			Yes. That -- right there. What
			is it?
			It's Commander Riker.
			To me it's just an undefined
			upright form, standing in a wild
			visual frenzy. Can you filter out
			the extraneous information?
			No, I get it all simultaneously.
			It's a jumble. How can you make
			heads or tails of it?
			I select what I want to see and
			disregard the rest.
			How is that possible?
			How, in a noisy room, can you pick
			out one specific voice or sound?
			It's something you learn.
			Exactly. It's something I have
			learned. Does that make it
			clearer?
			Yes. Look over at Data.
			There's an aura around Data.
			Yes, of course. He's an android.
			From the way you say that, you
			must think we all see it.
			Don't you?
			Captain - I don't mean to break
			this up, but...
			Yes, of course, Number One.
			Proceed.
			I am detecting high levels of
			Deuterium gas. Probably coming
			from the leakage in the drive
			system.
			Toxic?
			Not as yet.
			The life signs are emanating from
			the far side of Engineering.
			What's the safest way around?
			All routes are equally dangerous.
			Which one is the least dangerous?
			There is no significant
			difference.
			Then steady on.
			Commander, a fissure is developing
			in the bulkhead. The skin of the
			ship is losing its integrity.
			Where? I don't see it.
			There.
			Step closer.
			It looks to me like a spectrograph
			indicating metal fatigue. Is that
			how you interpret it?
			Correct, Captain.
			How long before the hull ruptures?
			Impossible to be exact. Five
			minutes -- probably less.
			Come on.
			I've lost the transmission.
			Signal overload. I'm surprised
			it lasted this long.
			The life signs are very strong
			now. They are coming from over
			there.
			Is there any other way around?
			Negative. This is the only way.
			I think the safest way to proceed
			is for me to cross alone. The
			heat and toxic gases have less
			effect on me.
			Agreed.
			I found them. The door to their
			compartment is jammed.
			The control mechanism. It is
			inoperative.
			This is Commander Riker of the
			USS Enterprise. Can you hear me?
			I advise against the use of
			phasers. The gas buildup is too
			great, Commander.
			Yes. A phaser discharge now could
			blow us all out of here.
			What's going on?
			We are about to force the door.
			What is it? What are you seeing?
			Klingons.
			Klingons.
			Tasha, go to Transporter Room
			Three. I want you there when the
			away team returns.
			I am Korris.
			We'll handle the formalities later -
			right now we have to get off
			this ship. Are there any others
			still alive?
			No.
			I believe there is a quicker way
			out of here.
			Let's go.
			Check him, Data.
			He is alive -- but just barely.
			Pick him up and let's get out of
			here.
			No. I will carry him.
			As you wish.
			We're out of time, Commander -- the
			ship's going to blow.
			Transporter Room, have you got
			a lock on us?
			Not yet. Too much interference.
			You have to get farther away from
			the Engineering section.
			Sir, the Engineering section is
			at critical. Destruction of the
			Batris is imminent.
			End of the line. Transporter
			Room, we've gone as far as we can.
			Get us off -- now!
			It's not good. I can't get
			locked on.
			They're out of options. Do it.
			Bridge, this is Commander Riker.
			We are taking the survivors to
			Sickbay.
			I'll need your weapons.
			I'll be in Sickbay.
			Captain. Request permission to
			join you.
			Granted.
			Situation, Doctor.
			His injuries are serious.
			I am Jean-Luc Picard, the captain
			of this vessel.
			My name is Korris -- captain of
			the Klingon Defense Force. This
			is Lieutenant Konmel.
			Do you mind telling me what
			happened?
			Not at all.
			Firstly, what were you doing on
			that ship? It's not Klingon.
			We were passengers. The Talarians
			were taking us to outpost
			M-Zed-Five.
			What was the ship doing in the
			Neutral Zone?
			We were attacked without warning
			by a Ferengi cruiser. During the
			course of the battle we must have
			unknowingly entered the Neutral
			Zone.
			The weapons were not Ferengi.
			What is your name?
			I am Lieutenant Worf.
			And you are a member of this
			crew?
			Yes.
			You are correct. The weapons were
			Klingon, but the vessel was
			Ferengi.
			What precipitated the attack?
			I don't know -- we were in our
			quarters.
			The captain of the freighter had
			no combat experience so he did
			not anticipate the first attack,
			which was nearly fatal.
			We took control -- with his
			permission. The Ferengi called
			for surrender. I told the captain
			to agree to all their terms. We
			had one chance -- I was confident
			it would be enough.
			As adversaries the Ferengi are
			not very worthy.
			Still, your weapons were limited,
			and their ship superior.
			Yes -- all we had was an ancient
			battery of Merculite rockets.
			Our only chance was to trick them
			into lowering their shields.
			We reduced power and lured them
			in.
			They suspected nothing.
			Then, when they lowered their
			shields to beam over a boarding
			party, we opened fire.
			Your strategy was very sound.
			There are still a few items that
			are not clear.
			Captain -- we are hungry and tired.
			Yes, of course.
			If there is anything more you need
			to know about this incident -- we
			will be available.
			Permission to show our guests to
			their quarters, Captain.
			Permission granted.
			What do you think, Captain?
			There's a lot more to this than
			we've been told. Why was the
			Talarian ship so far off course?
			What was its point of departure?
			And why would three Klingon
			officers hitch a ride on a broken-down
			freighter?
			Contact Starfleet -- find out what
			they know about Korris and
			company.
			It will take forty-eight hours
			for a message to get to Starfleet
			on subspace frequency.
			They are going to be with us for
			a while; we might as well learn
			all we can about them.
			Do you think I should have a
			security team assigned to our
			guests?
			No -- Worf is capable of dealing
			with anything that may arise.
			How's your patient, Doctor?
			Not good. I'll keep you posted.
			Tell me, what it is like for the
			hunter to lie down with the prey?
			Have they tamed you -- or have you
			always been docile?
			Does it make you gentle? Has it
			filled your heart with peace?
			Do glorious battles no longer
			inspire your dreams?
			Why do you mock me? Why do you
			wish to anger me?
			Only to see if it is still
			possible.
			It is.
			Doctor Crusher. I think you'd
			better look at this.
			The Klingon's condition is
			worsening.
			He's convulsing.
			Commander Korris, this is Captain
			Picard.
			Yes, Captain.
			I am sorry to report -- your
			comrade's injuries are beyond our
			medical abilities.
			He's dying.
			Is there any special arrangement
			you would like for the body?
			It is only an empty shell now.
			Please treat it as such.
			The opponent that killed Kunivas
			should have been an enemy -- then
			his death would have been even
			more glorious.
			If the opponent was not an
			enemy... who was it?
			Tell me -- what really happened?
			I do not wish to anger you. We
			are after all, brothers lost among
			the infidels.
			How did you come to this ship and
			that uniform?
			Through an act of kindness. The
			Romulans attacked the Khitomer
			outpost. Everyone was killed.
			I was buried under the rubble and
			left for dead. A human Starfleet
			officer found me. He took me to
			his home on Gault and told his
			wife to raise me as his son.
			How old were you?
			Before the age of inclusion --
			That young?
			Gault is a farming colony.
			When my foster brother and I were
			of age we entered the Starfleet
			Academy. He hated it and returned
			to Gault. I stayed.
			You haven't spent much time among
			your own kind.
			Almost none.
			So when the night was still and
			quiet, and the sound of the blood
			rushing through your veins filled
			your ears, the only way to
			silence it was to slip out into
			the night and, like the hunter
			that spawned you, join in the
			struggle of life and death... but
			you were unable...
			... And those around you did not
			understand. You frightened them.
			They shunned you. Cursed you.
			Called you vile names, and you
			knew not why. Even now do you
			know why you are driven? Why you
			cannot relent -- or repent -- or
			confess -- or abstain? How could
			you know? There have been no other
			Klingons to lead you to that
			knowledge.
			Yes -- those feelings are part of
			me, but I control them. They do
			not rule me.
			Yes, to fit in, the humans demand
			you change the one thing you
			cannot change. Yet, because you
			cannot -- you do, for that too is
			the mark of the warrior. You said
			I mock you -- I do not. I salute
			you.
			But, against whom do you test
			yourself? Against what enemy do
			you charge into battle?
			I have been in battle.
			Then you understand.
			I do.
			Brother, this peace, this
			alliance, is like a living death
			to warriors like us.
			You are right, we lied to your
			captain. We commandeered that
			freighter -- left the crew behind,
			and were in search of a place
			where we could live our lives as
			true Klingons.
			You did not fight the Ferengi.
			It was one of our own cruisers
			sent to bring us back.
			You destroyed a Klingon ship?
			I did not want to battle our
			brothers. But, we had no choice.
			Our leaders sent the cruiser.
			They have been corrupted by the
			illusion of peace.
			They have traded our birthright
			-- so they may die in their
			sleep...
			... A peace that makes the Klingon
			heart that beats in my chest
			wither and die.
			Is it permitted for you to show
			us around this ship?
			Yes -- of course.
			Captain, long-range sensors
			indicate another vessel
			approaching this area.
			Can you identify it, Mister Data?
			No, sir. Not yet.
			Keep a close watch on it. We're
			too close to the Neutral Zone for
			it to be random.
			What magnificent battles we could
			have at the helm of this ship.
			Perhaps your dreams of glory no
			longer fit the time. They
			belong buried with the past.
			Standing here we will never know.
			The answer lies out there. Our
			instincts will lead us.
			Instincts that have not been
			dulled by living among "civilized"
			men.
			I believe, Number One, that was
			the first time outsiders witnessed
			the Klingon death ritual. I think
			I can figure out why they look
			into the dying man's eyes - but
			the howling... ?
			It is a warning.
			To whom?
			They are warning the dead -- beware --
			a Klingon warrior is about to
			arrive.
			Captain, the unidentified vessel
			is moving towards us at warp five.
			Intersect in one hour, sixteen
			minutes, thirty-three seconds.
			Can we get a visual?
			I can try, sir.
			Magnify.
			Klingons.
			Open hailing frequencies,
			Lieutenant Yar.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			To Klingon cruiser -- this is
			Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
			USS Enterprise.
			I am Commander K'Nera. What is
			your purpose in this area?
			We came to investigate a battle.
			We rescued three Klingon
			survivors.
			Is that all that is left of the
			crew of the cruiser T'Acog?
			These men are not from the
			cruiser, they are off the
			freighter Batris. The leader is
			Captain Korris.
			You have him? On your ship? He
			is alive?
			Yes.
			He is a criminal. A renegade who
			with two others stole that
			freighter, and somehow destroyed
			the Klingon cruiser sent to bring
			them back. We expect the
			criminals to be delivered into
			our custody as soon as we are
			within transporter range.
			Where are they now?
			They are with Worf on Deck
			Seventeen.
			Deck Seventeen?
			Yes, sir -- next to the auxiliary
			turbolift to the Battle Bridge.
			Shall I alert Lieutenant Worf?
			No. Send a security team to Deck
			Seventeen.
			Captain, you don't think Worf
			would allow them access to the
			Battle Bridge?
			Right now, Number One, we cannot
			assume anything.
			Captain, should I stay at my
			tactical position or lead the
			security team?
			Lead the security team. And
			Lieutenant -- remember with whom
			you are dealing.
			Aye, sir.
			We have heard this ship can
			separate in time of battle.
			Yes. When relieved of its bulk,
			the Enterprise becomes an
			exceptional weapon.
			Worf.
			They are here for us.
			Step to the side.
			What is the problem?
			The captain wants those two taken
			into custody.
			Do not let them take us, Worf.
			Help us.
			Listen to the voice of your blood.
			You are not "of" these people.
			Yes. Join us.
			GO BACK!
			Bridge -- we have a hostage
			situation on Deck Seventeen.
			Bridge, this is Lieutenant Yar
			-- disregard. The situation is
			under control.
			By order of the captain, you are
			confined to Security.
			I thought for a minute we had a
			problem.
			Oh?
			Yes. It looked like Korris was
			going to hold the little girl as
			a hostage.
			That is not our way.
			Cowards take hostages -- Klingons
			do not.
			R'oiaro.
			A Klingon vessel is due to arrive.
			They have requested return of the
			renegades.
			They will be tried and executed,
			sir.
			Lieutenant Worf, understand that
			I am not unmindful of the mixed
			feelings you must have about this
			incident.
			Thank you, sir.
			Are there no other options, sir?
			None that I can see.
			He seems to be handling it well,
			sir.
			So far. But he must be torn.
			These are his people.
			Sir, the Klingon vessel is within
			range. They are requesting visual
			contact.
			Open frequencies.
			We are in position now to receive
			the criminals.
			We will prepare for transfer.
			Captain -- permission to address
			the captain on the Klingon vessel.
			I know it is against standard
			procedure -- but there is something
			I must say.
			Permission granted.
			K'OMGI BIMOGUS.
			G'ARMOND T'RIS.
			Could we speak English, sir? I
			am not comfortable in Kling.
			What is it you want?
			To plead.
			You waste your time. Their
			actions threaten the alliance.
			They disobeyed and must be
			punished.
			Yes, they must be punished, but
			not executed with dishonor.
			Why do you care?
			What burns in their eyes -- fires
			my soul. I hear their words and
			I see it all as it was. Part of
			me longs for that time.
			It's bred in the bone. We all
			do.
			Then send them to a planet in
			the Halee system. Allow them to
			meet death on their feet with a
			weapon in their hand. Not tied
			and helpless.
			When one of us dies that way --
			it diminishes all of us.
			Yes.
			Brother -- I feel as you. I too
			wish they could fly free. But --
			I have no choice.
			Sir.
			We await the transfer.
			Lieutenant Yar, escort the
			prisoners to the Transporter Room.
			Aye, sir.
			This is Ramos -- the forcefield
			in Security Three has...
			Lieutenant Yar to bridge. There
			has been an escape. Two of my
			security are dead. So is Konmel.
			Korris is loose -- and armed.
			Keep me informed, Lieutenant.
			Aye, sir.
			Data, visual on K'Nera.
			Visual on, sir.
			There will be a slight delay,
			Captain. Korris has escaped.
			He is a trained Klingon warrior,
			perhaps more than you can handle.
			It is no disgrace to request our
			assistance.
			I think we can handle the
			situation.
			Captain. Korris is in Main
			Engineering.
			Commander Korris. This is a
			futile effort. You cannot win.
			I will speak only to my countryman
			-- only to Worf.
			Captain, he has a phaser aimed
			directly at the Dilithium Crystal
			Chamber. At that range, one blast
			and...
			I understand, Lieutenant.
			Permission to leave the bridge,
			Captain.
			We'll both go.
			What's the siutation?
			He's on the second level. Armed
			with a phaser. We do not have
			a clear field of fire.
			How do you suggest we proceed?
			Wait him out.
			Captain. May I speak with him?
			I don't think that's a good idea.
			Right now he's running on
			adrenalin. Let it cool. There's
			no place he can go.
			He will wait only as long as he
			believes it is to his advantage,
			the moment it is not, he will fire
			his phaser into the Dilithium
			Crystal Chamber.
			That would destroy the Enterprise
			and him along with it.
			Yes... he knows.
			Talk to him, Worf.
			Brother -- I knew you would come.
			Now I... we have a chance.
			I could not do it alone, but I
			would rather die here, than let
			the traitors of Kling pick the
			meat from my bones. With you it
			will work.
			What will work?
			I will demand Captain Picard give
			us access to the Battle Bridge.
			We will separate from the rest
			of the ship, and together, we will
			light up the galaxy. Imagine the
			fear which will roll before us.
			Captain Picard will not comply.
			He cannot -- dare not -- refuse us.
			In order to save themselves, they
			will give us what we demand -- then,
			brother, we are free.
			Put down the phaser.
			Wait. I do not believe this.
			Believe it.
			I have tasted your heart. You
			have been with them, but you are
			still "of" us. Do not deny the
			challenge of your destiny. Get
			off your knees and soar. Open
			your eyes and let the dream take
			flight.
			My brother, it is you who does
			not see. You are looking for
			battles in the wrong place. The
			test of the warrior is not without --
			it is within.
			Here we meet the challenge. It
			is the weaknesses in here the
			warrior must overcome.
			No.
			You have talked of glory -- and
			conquest -- and legends we will
			write.
			Yes -- the birthright of every
			Klingon.
			Yet in all you say, where are the
			words -- duty -- honor -- loyalty.
			Without which a warrior is
			nothing.
			What are you saying?
			Put down the phaser.
			Living among these humans has
			sucked the Klingon heart out of
			you. You are a sham. My words
			were dust upon the ground. Your
			blood has no fire -- you are weak
			-- like them. I don't care what
			you look like -- you are no
			Klingon.
			Perhaps not.
			Wait.
			Open hailing frequencies.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			Commander K'Nera, this is Captain
			Picard.
			Yes, Captain.
			Korris and the other Klingon are
			dead.
			May I speak with Lieutenant Worf?
			Yes, Commander.
			How did they die?
			They died well.
			Do you wish the bodies?
			They are now only empty shells -
			dispose of them as you see fit.
			Worf, when your tour of duty on the
			Enterprise is complete -- consider
			serving with us. Your training
			and experience would be of benefit
			to us -- and perhaps there are some
			things we could teach you.
			I will consider it. Thank you.
			I was just being polite, sir.
			Commendable, Lieutenant. Mister La
			Forge, set course for Starbase
			Eight-four.
			Really... I have no desire to
			leave the Enterprise.
			Good.
			Course set.
			Speed -- warp five.
			Warp five.
			... And Worf.
			The bridge wouldn't be the same
			without you.
			Engage.
