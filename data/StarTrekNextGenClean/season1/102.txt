Captain's log, stardate 42353.7.
Our destination is planet Cygnus
IV, beyond which lies the great
unexplored mass of the galaxy.
My orders are to examine Farpoint,
a starbase built there by the
inhabitants of that world.
Meanwhile ...
... I am becoming better
acquainted with my new command,
this Galaxy Class U.S.S.
Enterprise.
I am still somewhat in awe of its
size and complexity.
... my crew we are short in
several key positions, most
notably ...
... a first officer, but I am
informed that a highly experienced
man, one Commander William Riker,
will be waiting to join our ship
when we reach our Cygnus IV
destination.
You will agree, Data, that
Starfleet's instructions are
difficult?
Difficult ... how so? Simply
solve the mystery of Farpoint
Station.
As simple as that.
Farpoint Station. Even the name
sounds mysterious.
The problem, Data, is that another
life form built that base. How
do I negotiate a friendly
agreement for Starfleet to use
it while at the same time snoop
around finding how and why they
built it?
Inquiry ... the word snoop ... ?
Data, how can you be programmed
as a virtual encyclopedia of human
information without knowing a
simple word like snoop?
Possibility ... a kind of human
behavior I was not designed to
emulate?
It means 'to spy, to sneak' ...
Ah! To seek covertly, to go
stealthily, to slink, slither ...
Exactly, yes ...
... to glide, creep, skulk,
pussyfoot, gumshoe ...
Captain ... I'm sensing a ... a
powerful mind ...
Something strange on the detector
circuits ...
It registers as solid, Captain...
Or an incredibly powerful
forcefield. But if we collide
with either ...
Go to Condition Yellow. And shut
off that damned noise.
Shields and deflectors, up, sir.
Reverse power, full stop.
Controls to full stop, sir.
Now reading full stop, sir.
You are notified that your kind
has infiltrated the galaxy too
far already. You are directed
to return to your own solar system
immediately.
That's quite a directive. Would
you mind identifying what you are?
We call ourselves "the Q". Or
you may call me that; it's all
much the same thing.
And I have presented myself to
you as a fellow ship captain so
that you will better understand
me.
Go back from where you...
Stay where you are!
Data, call medics!
He's frozen. Can you feel the
cold?
He would not have injured you!
Do you understand this; the stun
setting?
Knowing humans as you do, Captain,
would you want to be captured
helpless by them?
Now, go back or you will certainly
die!
Is he still alive?
For now. We'll do our best, sir.
Your little centuries go by so
rapidly, Captain. Perhaps you'll
understand this better.
Actually, the issue at stake is
patriotism. You must return to
your world and put an end to the
communists. All it takes is a
few good men.
What? That nonsense is centuries
behind us!
But you can't deny Captain, that
you're still a dangerous, savage
child-race.
Most certainly I deny it. I agree
that we still were when ...
... humans wore costumes like that
four hundred years ago...
At which time you slaughtered
millions in silly arguments about
how to divide the resources of
your little world. And four
hundred years before that you were
murdering each other in quarrels
over tribal god-images. And since
there have been no indications
that humans will ever change
.....
But even as far back as... !
... that costume, we had begun to
make rapid progress.
Oh? Shall we review your "rapid
progress"?
Rapid progress to where humans
learned to control their military
with drugs.
Sir, sickbay reports that
Lieutenant Graham's condition is
better.
Concern for one's comrade. How
touching.
And now, sir, a personal request.
Permission to clean up the bridge?
Lieutenant Worf is right, sir.
As Security Chief I can't just
stand here and ....
Yes, you can, Tasha.
Ah, yes... better!
Then later, on finally reaching
deep space, humans of course found
enemies to fight out there too.
And to broaden those struggles....
.... you again found allies to
permit still more murdering and
all over again the same old story.
No! The most dangerous 'same old
story' is the one we're meeting
now! Those who go on
misinformation, half-information,
self-righteous life forms who are
eager not to learn but to
prosecute, to judge anything they
don't understand or can't
tolerate.
What an interesting idea.
Prosecute and judge?
And suppose it turns out we
understand you humans only too
well?
We've no fear of what the true
facts about us will reveal.
The facts about you? Splendid,
splendid! You are a veritable
fountain of good ideas.
There are preparations to make,
Captain, but when I return...
... we will proceed exactly as you
suggest!
Sir... respectfully submit our only
choice is to fight. If we
Klingons understand anything, it
is the meaning of that kind of
talk.
My sentiments too, sir. Fight or
try to escape.
Sense anything, Commander?
Its mind is much too powerful,
sir. And frightening. Concur we
avoid further contact if possible!
From this point, no station
aboard, repeat no station, for
any reason will make use of
signals, transmission or intercom.
We'll try to take them by
surprise.
Inform engineering to make ready
for maximum acceleration. We'll
find out what this Galaxy Class
can do.
Aye, sir.
Records search, Data. Results
of detaching the Saucer Section
at high warp speeds.
Inadvisable at any warp speed,
sir.
Search theoretical.
It is possible, sir. But
absolutely no error margin.
Attention bridge crew!
Using print-out only, notify all
decks to prepare for maximum
acceleration. Maximum, you're
entitled to know, means we'll be
pushing our engines well past
safety limits. Our hope is to
surprise whatever that is out
there, try to outrun it.
Our only other option would be
to put tail between our legs and
return to Earth as they demand.
Engine room ready, sir.
The board shows 'green', Captain.
All go!
Stand by...
ENGAGE!
Velocity warp nine point two.
Heading, 351 Mark 11, sir.
Steady on that.
The hostile is now giving chase,
sir. Accelerating fast.
We're now at Warp nine point
three, sir. Which takes us past
the red line, sir.
Continue accelerating.
Counselor, at this point I'm open
even to guesses about what we've
just met.
It... it felt like something beyond
what we'd consider a 'life form'.
'Beyond'?
Very, very advanced, sir. Or...
Or certainly, very, very
different!
Sir, we're at warp nine point
four.
Hostile is now beginning to
overtake us, sir.
Are you sure?
Hostile's velocity is already warp
nine point six, sir. Shall I
put them on main viewer?
Reverse angle on viewer.
Magnifying viewer image.
Hostile's velocity now at nine
point seven, sir.
Ops, inform Engineering we need
more!
Engine room attempting to comply,
sir. But they caution us...
Go to yellow alert!
Arm photon torpedoes, Weapons
Station. Place them on ready
status.
Torpedoes to ready, sir.
That was a design tremor, sir.
A warning.
Hostile now at warp nine point
eight, sir.
Our velocity is only nine point
five, sir.
Projection, sir. We may be able
to match the hostile's nine point
eight, sir. But at extreme risk.
Now reading the hostile at warp
nine point nine, sir.
Attention bridge. Print-out
message, urgent, to all decks.
All stations on all decks, make
ready to detach ship's saucer
section.
You will command the saucer
section, Lieutenant.
I am a Klingon, sir. For me to
seek escape while my captain goes
into battle....
You are a Starfleet officer,
Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Note in ship's log that at this
startime, I am transferring
command to the Battle Bridge.
Make the signal, Data.
Captain's log, stardate 42354.1.
Preparing to detach saucer
section.
... so that families and the majority
of the ship's company...
... can seek relative safety while
our vessel's stardrive, containing
our Battle Bridge...
... and main armaments, will turn
back and confront the mystery that
is threatening us.
Lieutenant, your torpedoes must
detonate close enough to the
hostile to blind it at the moment
we separate.
Understood, sir.
Worf, this is the Captain....
Yes Captain?
Begin countdown....
Mark!
All decks acknowledging, sir.
Starship separation.... six, five,
four, three, two, one....
Ship's log, exact moment of
separation, stardate 42354.22.
All torpedoes have detonated, sir.
Reverse power and hold this
position.
Reverse power...decelerating.
That will bring them here in just
minutes, sir.
Will we make a fight of it,
Captain? If we can at least
damage their ship....
Lieutenant... are you recommending
we fight a life form that can do
all those things?
I'd like to hear your advice.
I... spoke before I thought, sir.
We should look for some way to
distract them from going after
the saucer.
All forward motion stopped, sir.
Commander, signal the following
in all languages and on all
frequencies: we surrender. State
that we are not asking for any
terms or conditions.
Aye, sir. All language forms and
frequencies.
Historically intriguing, Captain.
Very, very accurate.
Mid-21st Century, the post-atomic
horror....
All present, make respectful
attention to honored Judge!
Careful, sir. This is not an
illusion or a dream.
But these courts happened in our
past....
I don't understand either, but
this is real. I can feel that!
Get to your feet, criminals!
At least we are acquainted with
the judge, Captain.
Attention! On your feet,
attention!
You are out of order!
The prisoners will not be
harmed...
Until they are found guilty, of
course.
Dispose of that.
Can we assume you mean this will
be a fair trial?
Yes, absolutely equitable.
Proceed.
Before this gracious court now
appear these humans to answer for
the multiple and grievous
savageries of their species.
How plead you, criminal?
If I may, Captain....
Objection, your honor. In the
year 2016, the new United Nations
declared that no Earth citizen
could be made to answer for the
crimes of their race or
forbearers.
Objection denied!
This is a court of the year 2049,
by which time more 'rapid
progress' had caused all 'United
Earth' nonsense to be abolished.
Tasha, no...
I must... 
... because I grew up on a world
that allowed things like this
court. And it was people like
these that saved me from it. I
say that this so-called court
should get down on its knees to
what Starfleet is, what it
represents... 
You barbarian! That girl....
Criminals keep silence!
You've got a lot to learn about
humans if you think you can
torture us or frighten us into
silence.
Are they still alive?
Uncertain. Lieutenant Graham was
when our medics thawed him out.
You will answer the charges!
Or what? Or this, or worse? Or
death? I suggest you take a
better look at human history.
You are charged, criminals. How
plead you?
Just a moment ago, you promised
"the prisoners will not be
harmed." We plead nothing so long
as you break your own rules.
I suggest you center your
attention on the trial, Captain.
It may be your only hope.
And I suggest you now may be
having second thoughts about this
trial! You're considering that
if you conduct it fairly, which
was your promise, you may lose.
Lose?
Yes, even though you're judge, and
prosecutor....
And jury.
Accepted... so long as you keep
to your agreement.
And assaulting prisoners is hardly
a fair trial.
This is a merciful court.
SILENCE!
Continuing these proceedings, I
must caution you that legal
trickery is not permitted. This
is a court of fact!
... court of fact!
We humans know our past, even when
we're ashamed of it. I recognize
this court system as the one which
agreed with Shakespeare's
suggestion -- "Kill all the
lawyers".
Which humans did.
Which led to the rule: "Guilty
until proven innocent".
Of course. Bringing the innocent
to trial would be unfair.
YOU WILL NOW ANSWER TO THE
GRIEVOUS SAVAGERY CHARGE AGAINST
HUMANITY.
We'll be happy to answer specific
charges. "Grievous savagery" could
mean anything.
Obviously it means causing harm
to fellow creatures!
Such as you did when you froze
a member of our bridge crew? Will
you be joining us in the dock
here?
You fool. Are you certain you
want a full disclosure of human
ugliness?
So be it! Present the charges.
Criminal, you will read the
charges to the court.
I see no charges against us, your
honor.
Criminal, you are out of order!
Soldiers...
... you will press those triggers
if this criminal answers with any
word other than "guilty"...
Criminal, how plead you?
Guilty...
... provisionally so.
The Court will hear the provision.
We question whether this court
is abiding by its own trial
instructions. Do I have
permission to have Commander Data
repeat the record?
If this is legal trickery...
Your own words, your Honor.
Exactly what followed his Honor's
statement that the prisoner would
not be harmed?
Yes, sir. The Captain has asked
the question...
"Can we assume this will be a fair
trial?"
And in reply, the judge stated...
"Yes, absolutely equitable."
Unacceptable testimony, entirely
unacceptable... !
If your Honor pleases, there is
a simple way to clear up this
disagreement.
We agree there is evidence to
support the court's contention
that humans have been murderous
and dangerous.
I say "have been" ... and
therefore we will respectfully
submit to a test of whether this
is presently true of humans.
I see, I see.
And you petition the Court to
accept you and your comrades as
proof of what humanity has become.
There should be many ways we can
be tested. We have a long mission
ahead of us...
Another brilliant suggestion,
Captain. But your test hardly
requires a 'long mission'.
Your immediate destination offers
more challenge than you can
possibly imagine. Yes, yes, this
Farpoint station will be an
excellent test of human worth.
Stand respectfully. All present,
respectfully stand!
This trial is adjourned to allow
the criminals to be tested.
This honorable court is adjourned!
Captain, you may find you are not
nearly clever enough to deal with
what lies ahead for you. It may
have been better to accept
sentence here.
Uh... what is present course, Ops?
It's exactly what the Captain
ordered, sir. Direct heading to
Farpoint Station.
Confirm we are on that heading,
sir.
Know anything about Farpoint?
It sounds like a fairly dull
place.
Actually, Ops, I've heard just
the opposite.
Personal log, Commander William
Riker, Star Date 42354.4, at
Farpoint Station.
... U.S.S. Hood has dropped me
off at Farpoint Station where I
await the arrival of the new
U.S.S. Enterprise...
... to which I have been assigned
as first officer. Meanwhile...
... I have been asked to visit
the office of Farpoint Station's
Administrator.
I thought you might like to know,
Commander Riker, that we've still
no word from your vessel. But,
I trust we have made your waiting
comfortable?
Luxurious is more like it. Would
it seem ungrateful if I ask for
some information?
Anything!
Fascinating how in the midst of
an old city like this, you've
built a completely modern
tritanium and duraglass space
station. Your energy supply must
be as abundant as I've heard.
Geothermal energy is the one great
blessing of this planet. I'll
have all the details of that sent
to your quarters.
Thank you. But it still seems
incredible how you've built this
station so rapidly and so... so
perfectly suited to our needs.
Would your care for an Earth
delicacy, Commander?
Well, if there's an apple there...
It doesn't matter... what I was
saying was...
Well, I'll be damned!
Ah... ah yes, there was another
selection here...
Zorn, I would have sworn it wasn't
here a moment ago.
And does your failure to notice
it make it unwelcome?
The same with Farpoint Station,
Commander.
We hope a few easily answered
questions about it won't make
Starfleet appreciate it less.
I'm sure it won't, sir.
And this is delicious. Thank you.
Good morning, Groppler Zorn.
Good morning.
You've been told not to do that.
Why can't you understand? It will
arouse their suspicions.
... and if that happens, we will
have to punish you. We will, I
promise you. We must!
Doctor Crusher...
Mother, it's Commander Riker.
And hello to you, Wesley.
Enjoying Farpoint Station?
Yes, sir.
Saw you and thought I'd join your
stroll, if I may.
Actually, we're about to do some
shopping.
I've been meaning to visit the
mall myself. If I'm welcome?
Of course.
If you're wondering about Mom,
Mister Riker, she's isn't actually
unfriendly. She's just shy around
men she doesn't know.
Wesley... !
I believe that means he would like
us to be friends.
I'm willing, Doctor.
And although we're not officially
part of the Enterprise yet, I
thought there might be something
useful we could do while we wait.
"Useful"? How and what,
Commander?
Investigating some things I've
noticed here, Doctor. The last
was a piece of fruit...
Would this be available in emerald
green?
I'm sure, Commander, there are
reasons for a first officer to
want to demonstrate his energy
and alertness to a new captain.
But since my duty and interests
are outside the command
structure...
Isn't it nice he happened to have
the right color?
Thank you. I'll take the entire
bolt. Charge it to Beverly
Crusher, Chief Medical Officer,
USS Enterprise.
Let's see, where were we?
I was accusing you of inventing
work in order to curry favor with
your new captain. I apologize.
Finding the exact right color took
him only about twelve seconds,
Mom.
Maybe this is something Jean-Luc
Picard will want looked into.
Jean-Luc? You know Captain
Picard?
When I was little, he brought my
father's body home to us.
Yes, Wes, long, long ago.
Shall we continue the walk? I'd
like to know you better, Mister
Riker.
Where is she? They say she's
never late -- not since the old
burrhog took over the captain's
chair.
You wouldn't be talking about the
Enterprise, would you, Ensign
Markham?
Sir. Yes, sir.
You can stand at ease, gentlemen.
We're not on the Enterprise yet.
You know we're assigned to her,
sir.
Riker. I'm slated to be First
Officer.
I read the service records on all
new personnel on the trip out.
Excellent academic record at
Starfleet Academy, Mister Markham.
Thank you, sir.
And you, Mister LaForge. Captain
Dreyer praised your performance
on the Hood. Why did you request
transfer to the Enterprise?
Who wouldn't, sir? The biggest,
newest, fastest starship in the
fleet --
Commanded by the best burrhog in
the fleet. Right, Mister Markham?
Yes, sir.
I've already forgotten who used
those words.
Shouldn't we have heard something
from her by now, sir?
Commander Riker?
Yes?
The Enterprise has been picked
up on our monitors, sir. I should
tell you, sir, it is only the
Stardrive Section.
What about the Saucer Module?
We've received no explanation,
sir. But the captain signals that
you're to beam up immediately.
Our new captain doesn't waste
time.
A good rule for all of us to
follow, gentlemen.
Enterprise, this is Commander
Riker on Farpoint. Standing by
to beam up.
Lieutenant Yar of Security, sir.
Captain Picard will see you on
the Battle Bridge.
Battle bridge.
With the saucer gone, can I assume
something interesting happened
on your way here?
I'll let the captain explain, sir.
We are cleared into the standard
parking orbit, sir.
Make it so.
Commander Riker, sir.
Riker, W.T., reporting as ordered,
sir.
I really didn't expect to welcome
you to half a starship, Riker.
Is the viewer ready?
All set up, sir.
We'll first bring you up to date
on a little... "adventure" we had
on our way here, Commander. Then
we'll talk.
This way, sir.
Message from the Saucer Module.
It will arrive here in fifty-one
minutes, sir.
Inform them we'll hook up as soon
as they arrive.
Bring him to my Ready Room when
he's done there.
He calls that "a little
adventure"?
Come.
Wow!
Exactly.
This "Q", sir... is he crazy?
I mean, seriously?
Seriously, does it really matter
how we judge them? We're dealing
with something that can juggle
starships as if they were pebbles.
It's a rather astonishing "little
adventure" you've had, Captain.
The issue isn't what we call it,
Commander. The important thing
is we can be dead certain...
accent on dead... that "Q" wasn't
joking. We're alive only because
we were placed on "probation",
a very serious kind of
"probation".
Go.
The Saucer Module is now entering
orbit with us, sir.
Acknowledged. Commander Riker will
conduct a manual docking. Picard
out.
Sir?
You've reported in, haven't you?
You are qualified?
Yes, sir.
Then I meant now, Mister Riker.
You say you will be doing this
manually, sir? No automation?
As ordered.
Two percent rise. Up angle
adjustment three degrees.
Maintain docking speed.
Level her out. Maintain docking
speed. Docking crew, prepare for
reconnection.
All stop. Her inertia should do
the job now.
Rejoin lock-up... now.
Enterprise log, First Officer
entry. Ship's modules rejoined,
stardate 42354.71 with command
now transferred back to the main
bridge.
Neatly done, sir.
I don't imagine many mistakes
happen under Captain Picard.
No sir, they don't.
I'm Lieutenant Worf, sir. Captain
Picard requests you come
immediately to his quarters.
Come!
A fairly routine maneuver but you
handled it quite well.
Thank you, sir. I hope I show
some promise.
Some coffee.
No thank you, sir.
And now I have a kind of "what
sort of second-in-command have
I inherited?" question.
Yes sir, I thought you might.
I noticed in your envelope that
Captain DeSoto thinks very highly
of you. One curious thing,
however, you refused to let him
beam down to Altair IV?
In my opinion, sir, Altair IV was
too dangerous to risk exposing
the captain.
I see. A captain's rank means
nothing to you.
Rather the reverse, sir. A
captain's life means a great deal
to me.
Let me postulate something here,
Mister Riker. Isn't it just possible
that you don't get to be a
starship captain without knowing
when it's safe to beam down or
not? Isn't it a little
presumptuous for a first officer
to second guess his captain's
judgment?
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
Always.
You've been a first officer
yourself. You know that assuming
that responsibility must, by
definition, include the safety
of the captain. I have no problem
with following the rules you lay
down. But under no circumstances
will I compromise your safety.
If you have a problem with that,
sir, you can put me back on the
Hood before she leaves.
You don't intend to back off that
position?
No, sir, I can't.
One further thing... a special
favor I have to ask of you.
Anything, sir.
Using the same kind of strength
you showed with Captain DeSoto,
I'd appreciate it if you can keep
me from making an ass of myself
with children.
Sir?
I'm not a family man, Riker, and
yet, Starfleet has given me a ship
with children aboard.
Yes, sir. And families...
And I don't feel comfortable with
children. But, since a captain
needs an image of "geniality"
toward the little monsters, you're
to see that's exactly what I
project.
Aye, sir.
Welcome to the Enterprise, Mister
Riker.
Yes sir, Commander?
Thank you, Lieutenant. Is
Commander Data on duty?
Commander Data is on a special
assignment, sir. He's using our
shuttlecraft to transfer an
admiral over to the Hood.
An admiral?
He's been aboard all day, sir,
checking over medical layout.
Why the shuttlecraft? Can he just
beam over?
I suppose he could, sir. But the
admiral's a rather remarkable man.
But, sir, the transporter could
have you on the Hood in a matter
of seconds, Admiral.
Have you got some reason to want
my atoms scattered all over space?
No sir. But at your age, sir,
I thought you shouldn't have to
put up with the time and trouble
of a shuttlecraft.
My age? Hold it right there, boy,
what about my age?
Sorry, sir. If that subject
troubles you...
Troubles me? What's so damned
troubling about not having died?
How old do you think I am?
One hundred forty-seven years,
Admiral. According to Starfleet
records.
Explain how you remember that so
exactly.
I remember every fact I am exposed
to, sir.
I don't see any points on your
ears, boy, but you sound like a
Vulcan.
No, sir. I am an android.
Almost as bad.
I thought it was generally
accepted, sir, that Vulcans are
an advanced and most honorable
race.
They are, boy. They are. And
also damned annoying at times.
Yes, sir.
This is a new ship, boy, but she's
got the right name. Remember
that.
I will, sir.
You treat her like a lady.
She'll always bring you home...
Show me the results of Captain
Picard's most recent physical
examination.
Already at work, Doctor?
Yes, on a subject that's very
important to this mission,
Captain.
Screen off.
I wanted to say "welcome aboard."
Thank you, Captain.
And I thought I should talk to
you very personally about your
assignment here.
I wanted you to know I protested
your posting to the Enterprise.
Oh? Do you consider me
unqualified?
Hardly. Your service record shows
you exactly the kind of CMO I'd
want.
Then you must object to me
personally. Has it to do with
our last meeting?
I'm trying to be considerate of
your feelings, Doctor Crusher.
For you to serve with a commanding
officer who would continually
remind you of such a terrible
personal tragedy...
If I had any objections to serving
with you, I wouldn't have
requested this assignment,
Captain.
You requested this posting?
Captain. My feelings about my
husband's death will have no
effect on the way I serve you,
this vessel, or this mission.
Then, welcome aboard, Doctor.
I'm pleased to have you here.
Thank you. And now, if I can
return to my duties...
Well... as I said, "welcome
Aboard".
Have you signaled the Hood, Mister
Riker?
Your exact message.
Bon voyage mon amie. Aye, sir.
And what was my answer, computer?
DO YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT PATIENTLY
THROUGH ALL THIS NONSENSE? OR
DID YOU THINK I WAS GONE?
Do you intend to blast a hole
through the viewer, Lieutenant?
If the purpose of this is to test
human worth, your honor, you must
let us proceed in a normal human
way.
YOU ARE DILATORY! YOU HAVE
TWENTY-FOUR HOURS! ANY FURTHER
DELAY AND YOU RISK SUMMARY
JUDGEMENT AGAINST YOU, CAPTAIN.
Sorry, sir...
No criticism. You reacted fast...
... but in a completely useless
way.
I'll learn to do better, sir.
Of course you will. We've a long
voyage ahead of us.
Hope you're right, sir. About
the long voyage ahead.
I hope so too.
What do we do, sir? With them
monitoring every move, every
word...
S.O.P., Mister Riker.
Standard Operating Procedures?
We do exactly what we'd do if this
"Q" never existed. If we're going
to be damned, let's be damned for
what we really are.
Captain's log, stardate 42372.5.
Of the twenty-four hours "Q"
allotted us to prove ourselves...
... eleven have now passed without
incident. And yet I cannot forget
"Q's" prediction that we will face
here some critical test of human
worth.
This planet's interior heat
results in abundant geothermal
energy, sir. But it's about all
this world does offer.
And it's your belief that this
is what made it possible for them
to construct this base to
Starfleet standards?
Yes sir. We have to assume that
they've been trading their surplus
energy for the construction
materials used here. According
to our ship's scans, many of the
materials used are not found on
this world.
Perhaps it's like those incidents
you describe in your report as
"almost magical" attempts to
please us.
Those events did happen, sir.
And in time we'll discover the
explanation. Meanwhile, none of
it suggests anything threatening.
If only every life form had as
much desire to please Starfleet.
Ready to beam down? I'm looking
forward to meeting this Groppler
Zorn.
I'm convinced there's more to it
than just "pleasing us", sir.
Like something "Q" is doing to
trick us?
Over here, Counselor!
I've asked her to join us in this
meeting.
May I introduce our new first
officer, Commander William Riker.
Mister Riker, our ship's
counselor, Deanna Troi.
Do you remember what I taught you,
Izmadi? Can you still sense my
thoughts?
A pleasure, Commander.
I, ah... likewise, Counselor.
Have the two of you met before?
We... we have, sir.
Excellent. I consider it
important that my key officers
know each other's abilities.
We do, sir; we do.
I, too, would never say goodbye,
Izmadi.
My crew and I need a bit more
information...
... before we make our
recommendations to Starfleet.
No objections to that, but...
... but I'm puzzled over your
bringing a Betazoid to this. If
her purpose here is to probe my
thoughts, sir...
I can sense only strong emotions,
Groppler. I am only half Betazoid;
my father was a Starfleet officer.
I have nothing to hide, of course.
Good, since we admire what we've
seen of your construction
techniques. Starfleet may be
interested in your constructing
starbases elsewhere too.
Unfortunately, Captain, we are
not interested in building other
facilities.
If I may, Captain...
Then a trade, Groppler? Some
things you need in return for the
loan of architects and engineers
who can demonstrate your
techniques.
We Bandi do not wish to leave our
home world. If Starfleet cannot
accept that small weakness, then
we will be forced, unhappily, to
seek an alliance with someone like
the Ferengi, or...
Counselor... ? What is it?
Do you want it described here,
sir?
Yes! No secrets here if we're
all to be friends.
Agreed, Groppler?
We ourselves have nothing to hide,
but...
Pain... pain, loneliness, terrible
loneliness, despair...
I'm not sensing him, sir. Or any
of his people... but it's
something very close to this location.
The source of this? Do you have
any idea?
No!
No, absolutely not. And I find
nothing helpful or productive in
any of this!
That's it? No other comment?
What do you expect form us? We
offer a base designed to your
needs, luxurious even by human
standards...
... while refusing to answer even
our simplest questions about it.
We'll adjourn for now...
... while we all reconsider our
positions.
Captain, the Ferengi would be very
interested in a base like this.
Fine. I hope they find you as
tasty as their other past
associates.
Ensign, can you help me find
Commander Data? I was told he's
somewhere on this deck.
This way, sir.
You must be new to these galaxy
class starships, sir.
Tell me the location of Commander
Data.
Lieutenant Commander Data... now
located in Holodeck area 4-J.
And as you see, sir, it's pointing
you that way.
Go that way? How far?
You'll know, sir.
This way, please. The next
hatchway on your right.
Thank you...
You're more than welcome,
Commander Riker.
And if you care to enter,
Commander...
I do.
Hello!
Marvelous how easily humans do
that, sir. I still need much
practice.
There are some puzzles down on
the planet that Captain Picard
wants answered. He suggests I
put you on the away team I'll be
using.
I shall endeavor to give
satisfaction, sir.
Uh, yes. And when the captain
suggested you I, uh, looked up
your record...
Yes sir, a wise procedure always.
Your rank of lieutenant commander,
I assume now must be honorary.
No, sir. Starfleet Class of '78;
honors in quantum mathematics
and exobiology.
But your files... they say you're
a...
Machine? Correct, sir. Does that
trouble you?
To be honest... yes, a little.
Understood, sir. Prejudice is
very human.
Now that troubles me. Do you
consider yourself superior to us?
I am superior in many ways. But
I would gladly give it up to be
human.
Nice to meet you, Pinocchio,
A joke.
Ah! Intriguing.
You're going to be an interesting
companion, Mister Data.
This pattern is quite popular,
sir. Perhaps because it
duplicates Earth so well, Coming
here,
makes me feel as if I'm human too.
I didn't believe these could be
so real.
Much of it is real, sir. If the
transporters can convert our
bodies to an energy beam, then
back to the original pattern
again...
Yes, of course.
And all these have much simpler
patterns.
The rear wall.
I can't see it.
You will.
Incredible!
Mister Riker, isn't this great?
This is one of the simpler
patterns, Mister Riker. They've
got thousands more, some you just
can't believe.
Careful, that next rock is
loose... !
Wow!
Mister Data has agreed to join
my away team, Captain.
Very good.
Sir, maybe I should get something
to wipe this water up.
Good idea.
-- and there's a low gravity
gymnasium, too. It would be hard
to get bored on this ship.
Mom...
could you get me a look at the
bridge?
That's against the captain's
standing orders.
Are you afraid of the captain,
too?
I certainly am not!
But Captain Picard is a pain,
isn't he?
Your father liked him very much.
Great explorers are often lonely,
... no chance to have a family...
Just a look, at the bridge, Mom.
From the turbolift when the doors
open. I wouldn't get off. I
promise.
You're looking for trouble, Wes.
Let's see what we can do.
Recommend that someone could begin
by examining the underside of the
station, sir.
Our sensors do show some passages
down there, sir. Perhaps you and
I?
Tasha, you and the Counselor.
Let's us start with the topside.
Have you noticed anything unusual?
Well, I can't see through solid
matter, sir, but the material so
far looks very ordinary.
Confirmed by the construction
records, sir. Almost exactly the
same material that Starfleet uses.
Riker to Tasha, Troi, come in!
We were about to call you, Team
Leader. We've found something
interesting.
We're in a passageway directly
under the station sir. But the
tunnel walls here are make from
something we've never seen before.
And Troi, have you sensed anything
there?
Sir, I've avoided opening my mind.
Whatever I sensed in the
Groppler's office became very
painful.
I'm sorry, Counselor, but you
must. We need more information.
No, no, such pain. It's so close to
us here... pain, pain..
Hang on, I'm coming... Enterprise,
lock us onto her signal!
I'm sorry. Close your mind from
the pain...
It's also unhappiness... terrible
despair...
Who?
I don't know! No lifeform anything
like us.
What in the hell kind of place
is this?
Geordi, what do you see?
It's of no material I recognize,
sir. Or have even heard of.
Permission to report to the
captain...
Children are not allowed on the
bridge, Doctor.
Captain, my son is not on the
bridge. He merely accompanied
me on the turbolift.
Your son?
His name's Wesley. You last saw
him years ago when...
Oh, back then.
Well -- as long as he's here...
I knew your father, Wesley. Want
a look around?
But don't touch anything!
Try it out.
The panel on your right is for
log entries, library-computer
access and retrieval, viewscreen
control, intercoms, and so on.
Yes sir. And here, the backup conn
and ops panels, plus armament and
shield controls.
The forward viewscreen is
controlled by the ops position...
Yes sir, which uses high
resolution, multi-spectral imaging
sensor systems...
How the hell do you know that,
boy?
Perimeter alert, Captain!
Off the bridge! Both of you.
You have a perimeter alert,
Captain.
As my son tried to tell you!
Picard. Go ahead.
Ship's sensors have detected the
presence of a vessel approaching
this planet. No ship is scheduled
to arrive at this time.
Have Mister Riker, and his team
beamed back up! Security, could
that be the Hood returning here?
The vessel does not match the
Hood's configuration or I.D.
signal.
Put it on main viewer!
Identification?
Vessel unknown, configuration
unknown, sir.
Hail it!
We've been trying, sir. No
response.
Raise all shields, phasers at
ready.
Shields up, sir. Phasers ready.
Could this be that "Q" you
mentioned, sir?
I almost hope so, Lieutenant.
We face too many "unknowns"
already.
Continue universal greeting on
all frequencies. Get me Groppler
Zorn.
This is Zorn, Captain.
There is an unidentified vessel
moving into orbit with us. Do you
know who it is?
There are no ships scheduled to
arrive until --
I asked if you know who it is,
Groppler. You mentioned the
Ferengi Alliance to me.
But we have had no dealings with
them. It was only a... a
thought.
Are you very, very certain of
that, Groppler?
I promise you we were making an
empty threat, Captain. I wanted
your cooperation. Forgive me --
Definitely entering an orbital
trajectory, sir.
It measures half again our size,
Captain.
All stations, give any damage
reports.
I would guess we were being
scanned, sir.
Pain again?
Troi, you've been at it enough!
No, I feel close to an answer of
some kind.
Commander, something down here
is shielding our communicators.
Yes, that's exactly the feeling
I've been reading. As if someone
doesn't want us to be in touch
with our ship.
Come on...
... let's get to the surface.
There is no computer record of
any such vessel, sir. Not even
close.
Still no response, sir. We've
done everything but threaten them.
Sensor scans, Mister Worf.
Our sensor signals seem to just
bounce off.
Something's happening, sir...
They're firing on Farpoint,
sir... !
Bring phasers and photon torpedoes
to ready!
No, hold it, sir. They're hitting
the Bandi city, not Farpoint
Station.
Those stairs are where Tasha and
I entered down here, sir.
At this point, it becomes ordinary
stone and tile, sir.
Matching what's above.
My God! Was that a phaser blast?
Negative. But something similar.
You, Tasha, and Geordi will beam
up to the ship from here. Now!
Come on, I want to see exactly
what's happening.
Don't. If you should be hurt...
You have your orders, Counselor!
Carry them out!
Yes sir, I'm sorry, sir.
Enterprise, three to beam up.
Enterprise, Riker. Come in.
Enterprise, Enterprise, help us!
Come in, please...
... what shall we do? Help us,
please.
Tune him down!
Commander Riker, go ahead. Where
are you?
With Data, on the edge of the old
city, Captain. It's being hit
hard. Who's doing this?
And Farpoint Station? Any damage
there?
Negative on damage to Farpoint,
sir. Whoever they are, it seems
they're carefully avoiding hitting
the station.
It's from an unidentified vessel
that's entered orbit with us here.
No ID, no answer to our signals...
They're hitting the Bandi city
hard, sir. Many casualties very
probable.
Understand, Commander. Would you
object to a clearly illegal
kidnapping assignment?
No objection; anything you order,
sir.
Zorn may have the answers we need.
Get Groppler Zorn and bring him
here!
Aye, sir!
They're forcing a difficult
decision on me, Counselor.
But, I doubt protecting the Bandi
would violate the Prime Directive.
True, they are not actual
allies...
But we are in the midst of
diplomatic discussions with them.
Lock phasers on that vessel,
Lieutenant.
Phasers locked on, Captain.
Typical, so typical. Savage
lifeforms never follow even their
own rules.
Get off my bridge!
Also interesting, that order about
phasers.
Still standing by on phasers,
Captain.
Please don't let me interfere.
Use your weapons.
You're the one who has a lot to
learn, "Q". With no idea of who's
on that vessel, my order was a
routine safety precaution.
Really? No idea of what it
represents? The meaning of that
vessel is as plain as...
... as plain as the noses on your
ugly little primate faces.
And if you were truly civilized,
Captain, wouldn't you be doing
something about the casualties
happening down there?
Captain to CMO, are you reading
any of this?
Medical teams already preparing
to beam down, Captain.
Compliments on that, Doctor!
Any questions? Starfleet people
are trained to render aid and
assistance whenever...
But not trained in clear thinking.
Let's consider your thoughts.
You call us "savages" and yet you
knew those people down there would
be killed. You're the one whose
conduct is uncivilized.
Sir, they're firing on the planet
again.
Forcefields full on.
Go to thrusters! Position us
between that vessel and the
planet.
Aye, sir, thruster power to...
We have no ship control, sir.
It's gone!
Are you undamaged?
Yes. You?
All systems operating.
Please. You can make it stop.
Drive it away.
Drive who away, Groppler?
I don't know.
Unlikely, sir.
Our records show that you
supervised all Bandi contact with
other worlds...
We haven't done anything wrong!
Then if we can learn nothing from
you, perhaps we'll leave.
No! No, don't leave, I'll try
to explain some of...
First officer to Enterprise.
Go ahead, Riker.
We've lost Zorn, sir. Something
like a transporter beam, it
snatched him out of here.
Question, sir, could it have been
the "Q" character you met earlier.
None of you know who it is?
You're running out of time,
Captain.
Captain... Suddenly I'm sensing
something else. It's
satisfaction, enormous
satisfaction.
From the same source as before?
No, that was on the planet.
This seems to be from here.
Excellent, Counselor!
He's such a dullard, isn't he!
Captain from Transporter Room.
First officer and Mister Data now
beaming aboard.
Excellent also!
Perhaps with more of these little
minds helping, you'll...
That is enough, damn it!
We have an agreement; have you
forgotten... ?
We have an agreement which you
are at this moment breaking by
taking over our vessel,
interfering with my decisions!
You are not welcome on my bridge.
Now, either leave or finish us.
One of the two!
Temper, temper, mon capitaine. I
am merely trying to assist a
pitiful species. Perhaps I'll
leave if Mister Riker provides
me with some amusement.
Do nothing that he asks!
But I ask so little. And it is
so necessary if you are to solve
all this.
Beam over there with your... what
is it called... your "away team"?
You should already know what
you'll find there. But perhaps
it was too adult a puzzle for you.
Captain, with all respect, I
intended to suggest beaming over
there.
You show promise, my good fellow.
But you don't. You should have
long ago realized that, humanity
is NOT a criminal race!
YOU MUST STILL PROVE THAT!
Of the 24 hours "Q" gave us, we have
less than one left, sir.
But I had a feeling you impressed
him, Number One. That's hopeful.
Thank you, Captain, That's the
first time you've called me
"Number One".
I believe I'll enjoy getting to
know you, Bill. If we live long
enough.
Phasers on stun.
Energize.
Most interesting, sir.
Much the same construction as the
underground tunnel we saw.
But no sound of power; no
equipment. How does this ship
run?
Troi, what is it?!
Is it the same as you felt down
there?
No, this is... different. It
feels much more powerful... full
of anger... hate...
Toward us?
No. It's directed down toward
the old Bandi city.
Most intriguing again. The place
that this vessel was firing
upon...
Sorry, sir, I seem to be
commenting on everything.
Good. Don't stop it, my friend.
Enterprise, Riker. This is
turning out to be a very long
tunnel or corridor, sir. Still
no sign of mechanism or
circuitry...
... or controls, readouts, nothing
at all like any vessel I've seen
before.
Groppler Zorn, sir... in great
fear...
Just ahead.
It's definitely Zorn, Commander.
Here!
Careful...
Troi!!!
No! Please! No more! Please,
no more...
Zorn. Can you hear me?
Make it stop the pain. Please...
Has the alien communicated... ?
That's it, sir! It's just one
alien that I'm sensing here.
Please! I don't understand what
it wants.
Not true. He does know.
No, no, please don't!
Away team to Enterprise...
Troi... !
Enterprise, come in. Beam us...
Enterprise, we need help...
Transporter chief, yank them back!
Now!
Captain... !
Your time is up, Captain.
Get off my bridge!
Transporter Chief, do you have
their coordinates?
He can't hear you, Captain.
"Q", I've people in trouble over
there... !
Everyone, at ease! That's an
order!
My people are in trouble, "Q".
Help them; I'll do whatever you
say...
You'll do whatever I say?
It seems I did make that bargain.
The agreement isn't valid, sir.
It wasn't "Q" that saved us.
Save yourselves! It may attack
you now.
It was that which sent us back,
Captain.
Yes sir. It's not a vessel, sir.
It's alive somehow...
She lies! Destroy it while you
have a chance.
Make phasers and photon torpedoes
ready... !
No! Do nothing he suggests!
But that thing was killing my
people, Captain...
True, but why? Was there a
reason?
It is an unknown, Captain! Isn't
that enough?
If you had earned that uniform
you're wearing, you'd know that
the unknown is what brings us out
here!
Wasted effort, considering the
human intelligence.
Let's test that...
... starting with the tunnels you
have under Farpoint, Groppler.
Identical to the ones on that
space vessel lifeform, over there.
Why was it punishing you,
Groppler?
In return for pain you caused to
some other creature?
We did nothing wrong! It was
injured, we helped it...
Thank you, that was the missing
part.
Tasha, rig phasers to deliver an
energy beam.
Aye, sir.
Yes, Captain, I understand now.
It has to be conceivable that
somewhere in the galaxy there
could exist creatures able to
convert energy into matter...
And into specific patterns of
matter. Much as our transporters
do.
On the viewer, Captain!
Zorn, you captured something like
that, didn't you?
Warn my people, please! Leave
Farpoint Station immediately!
He's lied to you, Captain.
Shouldn't you let his people die?
Transmit the message. "Leave
Farpoint immediately".
Then it was a pair of creatures
I was sensing. One down there
in grief and pain, the other up
here, filled with anger...
And firing not on the new space
station, but on the old Bandi
city.
Attacking those who captured
it's...
... it's mate?
Energy beam ready, sir.
Lock it in on Farpoint Station.
I see now it was too simple a
puzzle. But generosity has always
been my weakness.
Let it have whatever it can
absorb. Energize!
Now getting feedback on the beam,
sir.
Discontinue it.
Groppler Zorn, there'll soon be
no Farpoint Station if I'm right
about this.
A lucky guess!
I know we deserve this loss, but
please believe me, we meant not
to harm the creature, but to use
it.
Sir, a feeling of great joy. And
gratitude.
Great joy and gratitude... from
both of them.
And why? Because it furnishes
entertainment to you! You use
other lifeforms for recreation.
If so, you've not provided the
best...
Get off my ship, you smug
hypocrite.
Why not? We can also meet
another time, another place.
That's doesn't frighten us at
all! You accuse us of "grievous
savagery"? No, the one proven
guilty of that crime is you!
I trust this isn't the usual way
our missions will go, sir.
On no, Number One, I'm sure
they'll be much more interesting.
