Ship's log, First Officer Riker
reporting. Stardate 41997.7 We
are about to make a brief but
necessary contact with the Jarada,
a reclusive race known for its
idiosyncratic attitude towards
protocol... The Federation has been
trying unsuccessfully to establish
a relationship, and now the task
falls to Captain Picard.
... In two days we will reach the
area of their planet, known as
Torona Four. The Jarada demand
a precise greeting. Their
language is most unusual...
... The slightest mispronunciation
is regarded as an insult.
The double bars indicate an
elongated "s" sound --
-- And the inverted "T" means to
hold the "zee."
Unless... ?
Unless it's followed by three wavy
lines; in which case the "zee"
becomes a "bee."
Exactly.
What a language.
It is an insect mind.
My mind's barely working.
Take a break, sir.
No. I want to go over it again.
You could be over-preparing.
You've been looking forward to
the upgrade of the Holodeck. You
have the time. You need the
diversion...
Dixon Hill.
The program's installed and
waiting.
Planet and city?
Earth... United States... San
Francisco, California.
Time period?
1941, A.D.
File or access code.
File Dixon Hill, private
detective.
Enter when ready.
Very funny, Dix. What'd you do,
lose another bet?
I don't understand --
The bellboy suit. Are you
moonlighting at the Fremont?
The uniform. Totally
inappropriate. Why didn't I
change?
Mister Leech called twice, and
there's a lady named Bradley
waiting in your office. Nice
legs.
Gotta hot date with my fella.
I'll see ya in the morning.
Uh, I lost a bet.
Oh well... At least you're ready
for Halloween.
Halloween?
I need your help, Mister Hill.
Someone is trying to kill me.
Captain's log, supplemental. I
am delighted with how the
Holodeck has created the
fictional world of Dixon Hill...
... the twentieth century
detective who has been a hero of
mine since childhood.
The illusion is flawless. The
computer characters accept me as
Dixon Hill, even to the extent that
Jessica Bradley, a millionaire's
wife from the wrong side of the
tracks, wants to hire me.
I'm not sure who wants me dead.
My husband... My stepdaughter...
Or a lover, perhaps?
Perhaps.
Perhaps Cyrus Redblock.
I need you to find out. Name
your fee.
Twenty dollars a day. Plus
expenses.
Agreed.
I haven't said yes yet.
Oh you'll say yes.
If it's Redblock, he must think
I've got what he's looking for.
But believe me, I don't.
I'll take your word for it.
Here's a C-note in advance.
Consider it a retainer...
... and next time, could you wear
a suit?
Remarkable.
You'll have to call again. I'm
just leaving. I'm not dressed
properly. I'll be back.
Not yet, please --
Memory: save current setting.
Current setting saved.
Holodeck OFF.
When I looked down on the street,
I actually saw automobiles!
An ancient Earth device used
primarily for transportation.
Ahh.
Also seen as a source of status
and virility; often a prime
ingredient in teenage mating
rituals --
Teenage mating rituals?
I saw an entire city block from
that window.
It sounds wonderful.
I'm going to try it again, only
this time I'm going to dress the
part.
Why not come with me?
I also want to take that
historian... the twentieth century
expert...
Whalen.
Yes, Whalen. He probably knows
more about Dixon Hill than I do.
I will tell him.
Invite him, Mister Data. This
is, after all, a leisure activity.
The sense of reality is
incredible. When that woman
kissed me, it was so --
Exciting?
Real.
The subject of this meeting is
the Jaradan rendezvous. Proceed
with the briefing, Number One.
This is primarily a necessary
diplomatic mission. The Jaradan
are strategically important to the
Federation. Previous attempts
failed because they are so easily
irritated. A slip in the
pronunciation of the greeting
caused a twenty-year rift in the
relation.
Therefore the captain must recite
the entire greeting without any
mistakes.
Simple as that.
Yes. If, on the other hand, the
captain makes even the slightest
error --
-- The captain is well aware of
the gravity of the situation,
Commander.
I have located a history tape
of the last Federation starship
to come in contact with the
Jarada. It graphically
demonstrates what happened when
that captain offended them.
The captain is familiar with that,
Data.
Should we not run it?
It's not necessary. Meeting
adjourned.
Why would the captain not want
to review all the information
available on the subject?
When you've seen the Jaradan
react once, you don't ever have
to see it again.
Dixon Hill is a most puzzling
character.
Not really. He was just a
twentieth-century Sherlock
Holmes.
But his modus operandi is quite
dissimilar. Worth investigating.
Indubitably, Watson.

Captain's log, supplemental...
The Jaradan rendezvous is eleven
hours away...
I am about to reenter the world
of Dixon Hill, this time properly
dressed. An experience like this
is more enjoyable when shared,
so I've invited Lit-historian
Whalen to accompany me. Doctor
Crusher will join us shortly...
Ready to go to San Francisco,
Mister Whalen?
More than ready, sir.
If it's anything like the last
time I'm sure you won't be
disappointed --
Request permission to accompany
you, sir.
I have mastered the lingo of the
period. Example:
It was raining in the city of
Angels -- a hard rain -- almost hard
enough to wash the slime from the
streets. But it never does. When
the rain stops, the boulevard
dries and the snakes once again
slink from their holes. That's
when my door opens and the
helpless, the desperate, walk
through with a heart full of hurt
and a pocket full of nothing.
It unearthed half-forgotten
feelings the same way it dug up
sleeping bones in shallow unmarked
graves.
It was that kind of day.
Dixon Hill: "The Black Orchid,"
Chapter Three.
Very impressive, gentlemen.
Now... Shall we?
Hey Dix!
How's tricks?
Uh, she's fine... just fine.
Wonderful! He really thinks
you're Dixon Hill!
Say Joe, I'd like to buy a paper
too, but I don't have any money.
Catch me next time, Dix.
"Hitler on the move... Roosevelt
presses Congress for British
aid... DiMaggio streak reaches
thirty-seven?"
DiMaggio. Joltin' Joe, the
Yankee clipper.
Baseball. A national obsession
at the time.
The streak they refer to, will
eventually reach fifty-six
games...
And be snapped by a pair of
journeyman hurlers for the
Cleveland Indians --
Cleveland!!!
They got no pitching! They never
got no pitching. What are ya,
nuts or somethin'?
The record will stand until the
year 2026, when a shortstop for
the London Kings--
Hey Dix, what gives with this guy?
He ain't from around here, is he?
Uh, no... he's not.
He's from South America.
Yeah. He's got a nice tan.
I should have listened to her.
She told me someone was trying
to kill her.
She's a page from a book, sir.
That's all she ever was.
Well, well, look what the cat
dragged in.
Cat?
What on Earth... Where the hell
did he come from?
South America. Can't you tell?
Wherever you're from, while
you're in my town, keep your nose
clean.
Well, tough guy, this time you've
really done it. Your goose is
cooked, but good.
I'm sorry about this, Dix.
Don't apologize to him'
Where were you last night between
ten and midnight?
That would be a bit hard to
explain.
Yeah? Well you'll have plenty
of time to come up with something.
You're goin' downtown.
What for?
For the murder of Jessica Bradley.
Status report?
We're being probed, sir.
The Jarada.
Most likely. But it's long
range. Can't be certain where
it's originating..
One could get the feeling they
don't exactly trust us.
Commander, I'm receiving a
subspace message from the Jarada.
That's not part of the plan.
Pipe it through.
En-ter-prise. The time has come
to honor us. We await your
greeting.
This is Commander Riker, first
officer of the Enterprise --
-- You are not captain?!
No sir, I'm not. I suggest we
commence with screen to screen
communication so we can see each
other --
-- You offend us! We will not
show ourselves to a mere
subordinate. We await your
captain's greeting with growing
unrest. End of communication!
Terrific.
Get the captain. You'll find
him in the Holodeck.
Hiya Doc. What's shakin'?
Are you alright?
I'm just a little dizzy, thank
you. I had some trouble coming
through. Where's Captain Picard?
He's on ice.
Pardon?
He's being grilled.
What is he Data, a fish?
The captain's being interrogated.
They think he's committed a
murder.
Shouldn't we be doing something
to help him?
Relax Doctor. It's all part of
the game. Believe me, he's having
the time of his life in there.
I've told you everything I know.
Yeah? Well, you're just gonna
have to tell us again. From the
top.
Very good. I've read all this
before. It's exactly as it should
be.
Spill it!
LaForge to bridge.
Riker here.
I can't find the captain, sir.
I told you, he's in the Holodeck.
Something's... gone wrong.
What are you saying Lieutenant?
I can't communicate with them.
I can't access the program -- and
I can't open the doors.
Ship's log, supplemental. First
officer reporting. Due to an
unknown breakdown in the Holodeck,
we are unable to locate the
captain and his party...
Tasha, take over. I'm going to
Holdeck Three.
Commander?... I've studied all
the technical manuals on the
Holodeck. I think I could be of
some help down there.
Geordi's well equipped to deal
with the situation, Wes. Right
now, your duties are on the
bridge.
His mother's in there too, sir.
Come on, Wesley.
Thank you sir.
... And you say you'd never met
her before she came to hire you.
I've already told you that.
Twice.
Yeah? Well you're gonna tell me
again.
Look fellows, this is no longer
amusing.
Easy, Mike!
You think you're tough, Hill!
But you're nothing! You're
garbage!
Don't take him too seriously, Dix.
His old lady's been giving him
a hard time. You know how it is.
I need to get out of here.
Yeah. I'll see what I can do.
Something on your mind?
Yeah. But I'm not sure I can
repeat it in mixed company.
You're a pretty hep lookin' broad.
Is that good?
It ain't bad. You like Charlie
McCarthy?
McCarthy?... Oh, you mean the man
who hunted Communist witches.
I got two tickets to the show
tomorrow night.
Do you mind if I experiment with
this device?
I don't care what you do.
Thanks, Mac.
Who is this jerk?
Okay Dix. We're bustin' you out
of here.
That's welcome news.
You better not try to leave town.
It's been a pleasure, sir.
I get the feeling he doesn't like
me.
We know you're dealing with The
Fat Man, Dixon. Take it from a
friend; it doesn't help your case.
I'll keep it in mind.
Thank you. For helping me.
Forget it.
When you comin' over for supper?
The kids'd love to see you, and
you know how much you love
Sharon's cooking.
Soon, my friend. But at the
moment I have other duties.
Blonde or brunette?
She's a lady all right... and her
name's Enterprise.
Sounds like a working girl.
I'll stop by the office with a
bottle of scotch. You can tell
me all about her.
Have a good time?
I'm not sure. Sometimes it seemed
too real.
Glad you could make it.
I must say, you wear it well.
Why thank you, Mister Hill.
I think it's time we got back to
the Enterprise.
We are on the Enterprise, Captain.
Yes. Of course we are.
Do we have time to see your
office?
I don't see why not.
The Holodeck makes excellent use
of a finite space.
Ah, Mister Hill. You've been
avoiding me.
It's Felix Leech! It has to be.
You know me, sir?
Well, I've read about you. Many
times.
I'm sorry Mister Leech, but we
really must be going. Call again
tomorrow.
You're being quite rude, Mister
Hill. You haven't even introduced
me to your charming companions.
That'll have to wait.
We have business! Urgent
business.
You're not going anywhere. Not
until we have a little chat.
Bridge to Holodeck. We're
approaching Torona Four.
Any word from the Jarada?
Not a thing, sir.
They may be testing us. Seeing
if we'll stick to the
arrangements.
What do we do now, sir?
We wait.
Everything checks out so far.
Ensign Crusher believes the
trouble may have been caused by
the Jaradan probe. If so, it
could be very difficult to
locate.
I'm not a man to be toyed with,
Mister Hill. You were hired to
locate a certain object. I demand
to know what you've done with it.
I can't help you, Mister Leech.
I'm afraid this game is over.
I assure you, this is no game!
Take it from me Leech, you'll
never find it.
Now... give me the gun.
But... they're not real.
This man has been shot. If we
don't get him to Sickbay, he'll
die.
There's massive internal bleeding --
How could this happen?
It'll happen again if you don't
cooperate.
You struck me! How dare you!
You'll be sorry! The Fat Man
isn't going to like this!
We have to get him to Sickbay!
Exit!
Computer! Exit!
We'll try the other exit.
Computer! Identify exit!
There is a programming
malfunction. The computer refuses
to identify the exits.
I'm losing his pulse!
Computer, this is the captain!
Identify exit!
Standard orbit, Mister Worf.
Aye sir, standard orbit.
Riker to Holodeck.
Nothing yet, Commander.
We're running out of time.
It's no use. It's just not here
anymore.
Suggestions, Mister Data?
I am at a loss. We are in a
Holodeck-created building of 1941.
The computer has refused to accept
voice commands. The controls for
the environment are therefore not
accessible. They are outside in
the reality of the Holodeck.
I could use some light.
Good day, Mister Hill. My name
is Cyrus Redblock. I hope you
don't mind us dropping in.
I see I have no choice.
Life is an endless stream of
choices. Unfortunately, you have
chosen to make my life more
difficult.
I don't suppose you'd be foolish
enough to hide it here.
I don't suppose so.
Still, I'm sure you won't mind
if we take a look around.
I wish you'd quit asking, since
it's obvious you're going to do
it anyway. It's a big waste of
time.
Good manners, Madam, are never
a waste.
Civility, gentlemen. Always
civility.
Get that stiff out of here.
He's not dead.
From his pallor, he soon will be.
You want I should throw him in
the garbage, boss?
The next room will do nicely for
now.
Which one struck you?
It was Hill.
For every action, there is an
equal and opposite reaction. A
truism that you have sadly
neglected.
I saw your light and figured you
were working late.
Guess I was right.
Nice company you're keeping, Dix.
You forget to take the trash out
this morning?
I'm a tolerant man, but I don't
tolerate disrespect.
Your devotion to etiquette is
highly admirable, sir. However,
your methods leave much to be
desired.
What have we here?
Looks like a ghost.
Where do you suppose he's from?
Where were you hatched, anyway?
Central America.
I've been all over this world and
I must say, I've not seen anything
like you.
He's not from this world. None
of us are.
We come from a world of fabulous
riches. A world of objects --
far greater in value than the one
you seek.
That's ridiculous! You're a
private dick. We've met before
and you never mentioned any of
this.
He's right, Dix. That's pretty
weak stuff. I can't even buy
that line of guff.
I am not Dixon Hill.
He's not!
I only look like Dixon Hill.
He speaks the truth, sir. From
your point of view, he is only
a fiction, a facsimile, a
knock-off, a cheap imitation.
Thank you, Mister Data.
Sorry sir, that did not come out
quite the way I interded.
Very good. Very, very, good.
What wonderful fiction! Quite
entertaining. I admire your skill
at trying to obfuscate our sense
of reality.
It is you who are not real, sir.
Data--
It is you who are imaginary
characters derived from a work
of fiction.
Give it up, fellas. These guys
are too smart to fall for that
story.
I am afraid you are not real either,
Lieutenant.
I don't want to hear any more
of this! You're making me crazy!
Deep down, you all sense the
truth. Deep down, you know you're
not real. All of you.
Shut up!!
Let me shoot them, Mister
Redblock. Let me kill them, one
by one.
A most interesting situation.
Perhaps we should test this
theory by killing one of them.
You've already done that! This
man is dying! This whole thing
is senseless!
Hardly! Senseless killing is
immoral. But killing for a
purpose is often ingenious.
Well said, Mister Redblock.
What's our purpose?
We are on a quest for knowledge,
Mister Leech.
We want the item.
We don't have it.
Shall I kill him?
No, kill the woman!
Redblock. I have the item.
At last. I knew it! God, man,
you are a character! Waiting
until the last moment! Testing
my resolve! What an ally you
would make! Now -- where is it?
I'll explain. But first, tell
Leech to back off.
Put the gun down, Mister Leech.
But I want to kill her!
Perhaps later. It won't harm us
to listen to Mister Hill.
Don't make any deals with that
slime, Dix!
Begin. Make your thoughts
fruitful and your words eloquent.
Your lovely friend's life depends
upon it.
There is a price.
By God, man, I knew we were of
the same stripe. Name it.
Mister Whalen's life. You must
help us save him.
What the devil --
Probes! I'm reading several
of them, sir. All locked on to
us.
Verified. Coming from the
Jaradans!
Open hailing frequencies.
Frequencies open, sir.
This is Commander Riker, aboard
the Enterprise. We demand that
you --
Cut that off!
Lieutenant LaForge to bridge.
Riker here.
Is everything all right, sir?
We felt quite a surge down here
--
Yes. Status report.
We think we have something, sir.
I'll let Ensign Crusher explain.
I've found three --
Forget the explanation! Can you
repair it?
I don't know if I should. If
this isn't done correctly, the
program could abort and everyone
inside could vanish.
Do you need more time to study
it?
No, sir. Whether we do it now
or later, the risk will be the
same.
Do it.
If we can find the way of getting
him to our Sickbay by fixing our
computer --
Computer? I do not know this
word.
-- A mechanical or electronic
apparatus capable of carrying out
repetitious and highly complex
mathematical operations at high
speed.
Computers are used to control,
perform, process, or store --
Enough!
Let me kill him. He's beginning
to irritate me.
Captain, the exit...
That's it! The way into our
world.
Remarkable. Is this a two-way
passage? Can one enter your world
and return to this one simply by
stepping through?
Yes. Allow us to help Mister
Whalen, and we'll return with
the item.
By God, sir, you are a scamp!
To think that I would wait here
--
If you are thinking of going
through yourself sir, I can assure
you that is not possible.
Not possible!
One look at you sir, proves
anything is possible.
Stand back, Mister Hill. I would
shoot you myself, but I don't want
to rob my assistant of his
greatest pleasure.
Thanks, boss.
After we've gone, kill them all.
Make sure no one ever finds the
bodies.
You're insane! You think you can
kill a cop and get away with it?
Why not? I've done it before.
Come, Mister Leech.
Our destiny awaits.
Au revoir et bon chance, mon ami!
Another world.
A whole new world to plunder!
Uh-oh.
What is it?
Nooo!! I want to live!! I want--
We've done it, but still no sign
of them.
Should we go inside?
Pick him up. Get him to Sickbay.
What about you?
I'll follow you. Now go!
I can't think of a way to thank
you. You know I can't take you
with me.
Someone's gotta book this creep.
Once a cop always a cop, I guess.
I have to go.
So this is the big good-bye.
Tell me something, Dixon.
When you've gone.... will this
world still exist?.. Will my wife
and kids still be waiting for me
at home?
I honestly don't know. Good-bye
my friend.
Captain!
Are you ready, sir?
As ready as I'll ever be. Open
hailing frequencies.
Frequencies open.
This is Jean-Luc Picard, captain
of the USS Enterprise. Aaaaard
kraxon Leeeeesss...
Risssssss... Trassssss.... Trasulah!
You have... honored us with
your words of greeting. A new
day dawns between us.
So... Have a nice vacation?
It was a nice place to visit,
but I wouldn't want to die there.
