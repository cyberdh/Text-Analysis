			Captain's log, stardate 41886.9.
			We are en route to Sarona 8 for
			much needed R and R. The entire
			crew is looking forward to the
			diversion. On a personal note,
			I have allowed myself the luxury
			of a head start.
			En garde.
			I took advantage...
			No, no. The advantage was yours,
			Number One. I'm out of
			practice... too much time on the
			bridge. En garde!
			Interesting move. What technique
			was that?
			The technique of a desperate man.
			Shall we...
			Yellow Alert.
			Picard to bridge. Report.
			It is not an attack that we know
			of, Captain. Origin unknown.
			Sensors did not detect the force
			until immediately prior to impact.
			Shields did not have time to
			respond. Damages unknown.
			We're on our way, Mister Data.
			Damage reports from all decks
			coming in, sir.
			Injuries?
			Minor.
			I still am unable to determine
			the cause of the energy force.
			There is nothing within a
			reasonable distance of this ship
			powerful enough to cause an impact
			of that magnitude.
			Mister Data?
			Damages and injuries are minimal.
			Where did it come from?
			I am still checking, sir.
			Hazard a guess, Mister Data.
			It appears to originate from the
			Pegos Minor sector.
			That far?
			Yes, sir.
			Lieutenant LaForge, set
			coordinates for that sector.
			Shields at full power.
			Aye, sir. Coordinates laid in.
			Sir, I am receiving a transmission
			from Pegos Minor. It's an S.O.S.
			Put it on audio, Lieutenant.
			I repeat, this is Doctor Paul
			Manheim. We are in need of help.
			Urgent. Any ship please respond.
			Coordinates are six-six-seven
			eight point nine by
			seven-zero-seven-five-four-two
			point two. Manheim out.
			I can't get through, Captain.
			Turn it off. Lay in a course for
			those coordinates, LaForge. Warp
			eight.
			Aye, sir. Plotted and laid in.
			Estimated arrival four hours,
			seventeen minutes, thirty-five
			seconds.
			Isn't Manheim the one who was
			thrown out of the Institute for
			unauthorized experiments?
			Quite the contrary, Commander.
			He left of his own volition.
			Professor Manheim is the most
			highly reputed scientist within
			the Federation. A brilliant
			visionary who...
			... Who disappeared over fifteen
			years ago. Along with his wife,
			Laura.
			Did you know him, Captain?
			No. He was teaching at the
			University when I was in Paris,
			but I never had the pleasure.
			Number One, you have the Conn.
			Inform me half an hour before we
			reach the coordinates.
			Aye, sir.
			Computer, this is Captain Picard.
			What is your pleasure, Captain?
			Paris. Twenty-two years ago.
			A warm spring day. April ninth.
			Eighteen hundred hours -- three
			o'clock.
			Monsieur, welcome to Cafe Des
			Artistes. Is this your first time
			in Paris?
			No, I've been here before.
			That table.
			Mais oui, we are here to please
			you.
			I've been away far too long.
			Some wine, some cheese, a perfect
			tarte tatin...
			I'm afraid I'm not hungry. I
			really came for the view.
			Perhaps what you hunger for is
			not on the menu?
			Perhaps not. It was many years
			ago, I had a rendezvous -- I was
			to meet someone, a young woman,
			here, at this very table.
			She did not come?
			I don't know, actually. I've
			always imagined that she did.
			You, however, did not. Trust
			Edouard. I will bring something
			special, just for you.
			I'm not staying if all you're
			going to do is talk about him.
			What is this for?
			My lunch. Feed it to the birds.
			He will come. He will.
			Yes, I'm sure he will.
			He's a military man, just like
			you. We're going to get married
			and he's going to stay here in
			Paris and never leave me.
			He's stationed here?
			Not yet, but that's the way I've
			got it planned. Last night, well,
			after last night, he just couldn't
			leave. He couldn't.
			If he's as young as you are, maybe
			he doesn't know yet exactly what
			he wants to do.
			You're an important Starfleet
			officer -- what would you advise
			my lover to do -- go off and
			explore the galaxy or stay here
			and explore something which has
			no boundaries -- love?
			I would tell him that he must be
			the person he is meant to be...
			and that you deserve nothing less
			than that.
			Bordeaux, a very passionate year.
			A glass for the young lady.
			Do I remind you of the girl you
			left behind?
			No. Yes, you do. It's hard to
			say, it has been many years.
			Then you have forgotten her face.
			Not a single detail. I can see
			every inch of her to this day and
			being here -- I can feel the
			softness of her in the breeze,
			smell the fragrance of her in the
			flowers. I have not forgotten.
			What was her name?
			Laura.
			You've been at that console twice
			as long as you estimated.
			My estimation was incorrect,
			Captain.
			And I think it would be best if
			what I am about to tell you were
			also incorrect.
			Nonsense. Out with it.
			Someone, I would assume Professor
			Manheim, opened up a window. A
			window into another dimension.
			You don't know how?
			You don't know what it is?
			What came through this window?
			A window, that's all you know.
			Sir, the answers to your questions
			will be the most important
			scientific answers of the
			twenty-fourth century.
			Manheim.
			Captain, we've reached the
			coordinates specified. There's
			nothing here.
			I am receiving new coordinates.
			It's a relay signal, the same
			source as the first one.
			Set course for the new
			coordinates.
			Aye, sir.
			Why would someone make it this
			difficult to find him if he truly
			wants to be found?
			A failsafe, I would imagine.
			Captain, my sensors are picking
			up what appears to be a small
			planet.
			Mister LaForge, standard orbit.
			Give me a visual.
			Aye, sir.
			Viewscreen on.
			There's a forcefield of some kind
			surrounding the planet, sir.
			Penetrable?
			No, sir.
			Open hailing frequencies.
			Hailing frequencies open, sir.
			This is the USS Enterprise
			responding to your signal for
			help.
			Help. Please help me. I don't
			know what to do. It's only the
			two of us. He's shaking. Please.
			Can you lock onto her coordinates?
			No, sir. The forcefield is
			preventing any kind of contact
			other than audio.
			Mrs. Manheim, this is... the
			captain of the Enterprise. Is
			your husband conscious?
			No. You've got to help him.
			There's a force field surrounding
			your planet.
			Yes. I know.
			Good. Then you must be very brave
			and leave his side long enough
			to shut down the system that is
			preventing us from helping you.
			Good.
			Lock onto their coordinates and
			beam them up.
			I'd like extra decontamination
			precautions, Captain.
			Fine, Number One.
			The professor seems to be going
			in and out of consciousness.
			Well, the first time he's "in"
			be sure you find out what the hell
			he was up to down there.
			Is anything wrong, sir?
			No.
			Jean-Luc?
			Laura.
			It's not good.
			When will I be able to question
			him?
			I don't know.
			Is he dead?
			No. I've sedated him.
			I'll do everything I can to save
			him.
			Doctor, we need to talk to this
			man as soon as we can.
			I'll let you know as soon as he
			regains consciousness.
			Thank you. Thank you, all.
			Bridge, Picard. Status report.
			Shields are holding, Captain.
			Ten percent loss of power.
			Minimal damage, all decks.
			We can't wait for this man to wake
			up to find out what's going on
			here. Clearly, whatever this
			window is, it's still open.
			Agreed, Captain. I'll have Data
			start immediately on a thorough
			evaluation of all of Doctor
			Manheim's theories.
			Head gone. Must fill up. It's
			in the cross!
			When did this start?
			Right before he sent out the
			S.O.S. -- after he -- well, he'd
			been in the lab for at least three
			days.
			Laura, I'm afraid I need to ask
			you a number of questions - and
			time is of the essence.
			You can use my office.
			This is not how I imagined it.
			Nor I.
			You've done well. Exactly as
			you'd hoped.
			Not exactly. Nothing works just
			as you hope... Laura, I'm sorry
			about your husband.
			I need some information from you.
			I don't know what I can tell you,
			Jean-Luc. At best, I'm a
			glorified laboratory assistant.
			Paul's mental capabilities are
			so far beyond yours and mine, he
			couldn't discuss his work with
			me.
			But you must know something of
			the nature of his experiments.
			He lectures me, he practices on
			me, but he doesn't confide in me.
			I stopped listening long ago.
			Why did he come here? Why Vandor?
			He said it was because it was far
			enough away, no one would or could
			steal his theories... or stop him
			from trying to prove them.
			What he was working on is
			unquestionably quite dangerous
			as well as out of control.
			He's a little like you, Jean-Luc.
			He loves, he needs the challenges
			of the unknown... all I do know
			is that he's been very close to
			a major breakthrough. He's been
			excited and agitated and working
			around the clock for the past few
			months.
			Why weren't you affected?
			Every time he began an experiment,
			he insisted I stay in what he said
			was a protected room. I guess
			he was right.
			Fifteen years here? By yourself?
			There was no place left for Paul
			to go -- and I am his wife.
			Our destiny isn't always exactly
			what we expect. Isn't that what
			you just said?
			I must send a team to the planet.
			You can't. It's protected.
			Paul's made sure no one can get
			in.
			Excuse me.
			Is he worse?
			He's resting. I'd like to have
			you undergo some tests as well.
			He'll start them.
			Thank you for your kindness,
			Doctor.
			She's an old friend.
			I gathered that. It's her husband
			I'm more concerned with at the
			moment.
			What's his prognosis?
			So far, he's dying and there's
			nothing I can do about it. His
			entire genetic structure is
			altering -- constantly. I don't
			know how or why. I've never
			encountered anything like it
			before.
			How long does he have?
			Maybe a couple of days. It's not
			predictable. All I can do is
			attempt to maintain him until we
			find out what's causing the
			damage.
			Can I talk to him?
			You may never be able to talk to
			him. He may never be coherent
			again.
			Doctor.
			I haven't seen Mrs. Manheim since
			Paris.
			You needn't explain, Captain.
			It was a very long time ago.
			Yes. She's a lovely woman.
			Were you able to get any
			information, sir?
			Mrs. Manheim is in the dark about
			her husband's work. And he may
			never come out of the state he's
			in. What have you found out?
			Sensors show there's an immense
			volume of energy being reflected
			from a small point on the planet's
			surface... near the main
			Laboratory.
			Reflecting what?
			We do not know yet, sir. It
			appears to be moving from a thin
			beam into wider beams and back
			again in an unstructured manner.
			Is this "beam" responsible for
			the jolt we just felt?
			Not directly, sir. It is possible
			the beam is responsible for
			opening the "window."
			But that's pure assumption. We
			still know virtually nothing about
			Manheim's work.
			About this particular work, sir.
			Professor Manheim is renowned for
			his work in perfecting subspace
			communications, and
			thermodynamics, but those
			particular achievements seem to
			have no bearing on what he is
			trying to do on Vandor.
			To the point, Mister Data.
			When he disappeared fifteen years
			ago, he had been working on
			theories of non-linear time. His
			colleagues apparently questioned
			his obsession -- and his
			methodology.
			How far did he get?
			No one knows. He became angry
			about their doubts that he could
			enter other dimensions. He left
			the Institute. That is the last
			anyone heard of him until now.
			Can we deal with what's happening
			down there from the ship?
			Unlikely. I would need to see
			the Doctor's notes. And even then,
			his mind is of such unparalleled
			brilliance, I am not sure I could
			decipher them.
			There is an elaborate defense
			system to protect his work.
			We can get through any system.
			It's worth a try.
			Agreed. Take a small away team.
			See what you can find down there.
			Worf. Data.
			Energize.
			I don't care if you have a signal
			or not -- bring them back!
			They will return. Please, they've
			got to.
			I have a reading, it's not much,
			not complete...
			... Lock on, man. Beam them back!
			Medical Emergency Team in
			Transporter Sixteen.
			Good God, what happened out there?
			One at a time.
			Stop! I'll wait for Lieutenant
			Worf.
			I'm all right!
			I'll see you all in my Ready Room.
			A dragon?
			Not exactly, sir, but a monster
			that...
			... It wasn't anything at all like
			that. It was beautiful --
			godlike.
			It was completely logical in the
			most disorganized way possible.
			Colors, sounds, lights. Not light
			you see, but light you feel.
			You each experienced something
			different and it affect you in
			dissimilar ways.
			Sir, Worf is a warrior. He
			probably confronted his dragon
			and fought with it. Professor
			Manheim also tried to analyze
			whatever it is that comes through
			this window. They were both
			struck down.
			I experienced it.
			I observed.
			However interesting this may be,
			it is not, as far as I can tell,
			bringing us any closer to closing
			that damn window.
			Check and re-check all the sensor
			readings that were taken while
			you were "out there."
			Yes, sir.
			Number One, are you clear-headed
			enough to do some research?
			Yes, sir.
			Good, then go over all the
			material that Mister Data collected
			on Manheim's various theories.
			Maybe you'll be able to see
			something that ties in. Something
			that explains the experience you
			just had.
			Yes, Captain.
			Lieutenant Worf... go to your
			quarters and rest...
			... I feel fine, Captain.
			That's an order. There will be
			plenty of "dragons" left when you
			awaken.
			Yes, sir.
			This has nothing to do with their
			subconscious fears and dreams?
			I'm afraid not, sir. This is
			real.
			That's what I was afraid you'd
			say, Counselor.
			Where am I?
			Thank God. We're on the USS
			Enterprise. They answered your
			distress signal.
			I sent an S.O.S.?
			Yes. Oh, Paul, you're going to
			be fine.
			I'm not fine, Laura. I'm not even
			close to fine.
			Always remember this one thing...
			Professor Manheim is conscious.
			Remember... It was worth it. What
			happened, what will happen, all
			of it. It was all worth it.
			The Board was right. We should
			have stayed at the Institute.
			Then you never would have seen
			your Picard.
			What are you talking about?
			Fate.
			But, how could you know, I never
			told you about Jean-Luc?
			I know more things now than I
			could have learned in twenty
			lifetimes. And one of the things
			I know is that you, my darling,
			belong with him. It's your
			destiny.
			Laura, don't you understand, none
			of that's important now. I've
			been on the other side!
			Doctor Manheim, please try to stay
			calm. There are many questions
			we need to ask you.
			Professor Manheim.
			Captain Picard.
			We need your help. The situation
			is not good.
			And I need yours. My body seems
			to be in poor physical condition.
			I need you to go down to the
			planet and collect my notes, my
			calculations.
			We intend to. What exactly were
			you working on when this window
			to another dimension was opened?
			How were you able to determine
			that?
			We are not totally without
			resources.
			I'll speak to the Science Officer.
			Lieutenant Commander Data at your
			service, Professor.
			I have spent the last twenty years
			struggling with time/gravity
			theories.
			I suspected it but I could not
			be sure.
			There is one security system after
			another on your way down to the
			planet.
			We had the privilege of running
			into one of them when we tried
			to beam down.
			What about time/gravity?
			It's all in my notes.
			I'd rather hear it from you
			personally, a condensed version.
			There is hardly a condensed
			version of the most complex theory
			of the twenty-fourth century,
			Captain Picard, but if you insist,
			I'll attempt one that even you
			will be able to understand.
			A star four light years away went
			nova. I have been able to
			mathematically... "latch" onto
			the incredible gravity of this
			smooth back globe and direct that
			energy, that nearly immeasurable
			force, into space.
			So -- this energy, directed into
			space, then what?
			Then, abracadabra, Captain Picard,
			we all see God! A window to
			another dimension, isn't that how
			you put it? So pedestrian.
			Fine. My scientific knowledge
			isn't the issue here -- yours is.
			You opened it. Are you brilliant
			enough to close it?
			Give me thirty cc's of trisinov.
			I'll give you the correct
			coordinates to beam safely to
			Vandor and the electrical codes
			you'll need to bypass security
			systems to get into my lab.
			I'm sorry Captain, my powers
			appear to be quite useless in this
			particular instance. Whatever
			Professor Manheim is going through
			is to feelings what white is to
			color. I cannot distinguish one
			feeling from another. They are
			all there.
			Certainly hostility.
			It would seem he has reason to
			feel hostile to you, sir, his
			wife...
			Yes, Counselor, let's stick to
			the important issues. Lieutenant
			Worf.
			Yes, sir?
			I want every heading that Manheim
			gave Mister Data checked out and then
			rechecked. No one's beaming down
			to Vandor until we can be
			reasonably sure they'll make it
			through.
			Right away, sir.
			I'll be in my quarters, Number
			One.
			Everything's under control,
			Captain.
			He has had a great emotional
			shock. This, coupled with the
			strain of command, is wearing on
			him.
			Women!
			I would think that someone who
			has so recently seen God would
			be a little more... well...
			... No one ever said that God
			didn't have a sense of humor.
			Did you ever hear the one about...
			You saved it. All these years.
			I wondered when you would come.
			You are so beautiful, my throat
			feels as if it will close and I
			will never be able to tell you
			how beautiful you truly are.
			My love, why didn't you come to
			meet me that last day in Paris?
			Fear. Fear of losing you. Fear
			of staying and losing myself.
			Not a day went by that I didn't
			look up into the sky and will you
			to know...
			... to know that I loved you still.
			I always did and Jean-Luc, I
			always will.
			My love. I cannot live without
			you.
			I'll never leave you again.
			Who are you?
			I'm Doctor Crusher and I'm trying...
			Imposter! Touch me and you touch
			whatever your head can't
			understand. I am real. You are
			illusion.
			Try to rest.
			I am rest. I am action. I am you.
			Imposter.
			I wish I could talk to you --
			Professor Manheim. I bet you were
			really something.
			Deanna?
			I wanted to see how he was doing.
			The same. Nothing I do seems to
			make any difference.
			That's not why you're here.
			I'm supposed to be the empath.
			Are you all right?
			Why wouldn't I be? I've got one
			of the medical wonders of the
			galaxy dying in my Sickbay.
			That isn't what I meant.
			I don't think I want to talk about
			what I think you mean.
			You're not helping the situation
			by pretending it doesn't exist.
			I'm making it worse?
			I didn't say that. I said you're
			not helping it. Or yourself.
			Or the captain.
			That's his problem.
			All right. I'm still not sure
			how I feel about him. Now it
			looks as if I'll never know...
			are you happy? I said it.
			Talk to him.
			No. I can't compete with a ghost
			from his past. No one could.
			She's not a ghost. She's here
			right now.
			She may be in the here and now,
			but it's the ghost he sees. No
			Deanna, he'll have to work it
			through without my... input.
			There. Now I feel better.
			thanks, Deanna.
			How soon, Mister Data?
			I am almost through comparing the
			calculations, Captain.
			Bridge, this is Sickbay. Doctor
			Manheim is awake and asking to
			speak with you, Captain. Alone.
			On my way, Doctor.
			Can we do it?
			I believe so. But it must be
			soon. Sensors indicate a rapid
			deterioration of the atmosphere.
			I cannot be more sure than that,
			Commander. Not until I see what
			is in Professor Manheim's
			laboratory.
			Okay. Let's get ready. Worf.
			You asked for me.
			You belong with Laura. It's the
			way it's supposed to be. Give
			me your word you'll take care of
			her.
			I did not come here to discuss
			her. I will not discuss her with
			you until your irresponsible
			actions are checked and until my
			away team is back on this ship
			safe and sound.
			It is only Laura who concerns me.
			Then she is wrong. We are very
			different, you and I. For which
			I am grateful.
			Good. You will take care of her.
			I have the coordinates exactly
			in the corridor the Professor
			specified.
			We're ready.
			Good luck.
			Respirators on.
			Shields barely holding, sir.
			Damage reports coming in.
			Contact the away team!
			Maintain an open frequency, Number
			One.
			Frequency open, sir.
			Look out!
			Manheim forgot to mention that
			one.
			What is it?
			Hopefully, an easily deactivated
			alarm system.
			More surprises.
			Captain, a problem with Manheim's
			security. Any chance he's awake?
			No, Commander. Doctor Crusher
			is under orders to inform me if
			the professor regains
			consciousness.
			What's the problem?
			Professor Manheim's state of
			consciousness is of little use
			to us.
			Explain.
			It appears, sir, he was more
			interested in making certain his
			notes were destroyed than in
			our safety. When we came into
			the lab we triggered an explosive
			device. In less than ten minutes
			the lab and whoever is in it will
			cease to exist.
			I'd like to wake him up myself.
			Do not bother, sir. Manheim
			himself could not stop this. It
			is deactivated by a photogenetic
			code. Manheim's is altered.
			My suggestion is to continue the
			mission posthaste.
			You've got seven minutes. I don't
			care what you've found or what
			you're doing, clear?
			Yes, sir. Worf check the outer
			perimeter -- carefully. And
			Data...
			Truly incredible.
			Sir, the sensor findings from the
			last blast are in.
			And?
			They're different from all
			previous waves.
			In magnitude, in energy mass, in
			composition?
			In every way, sir. It would seem
			we are dealing with something
			that's not even remotely easy to
			classify. We might sit here for
			the next hundred years being
			blasted daily, and no two blasts
			would be the same.
			Anything could happen. We're
			dealing with another dimension.
			Are you saying it could
			arbitrarily, or even with fine
			methodology, change direction and
			instead of blasting us, draw us
			in... suck us through the window?
			That would certainly be a viable
			possibility, sir. One of
			trillions.
			With so much to fear, there is
			truly nothing to do but remain
			calm.
			It is the only chance we have.
			What is?
			A reversal of the same effect
			Doctor Manheim has programmed into
			the computer.
			How?
			There is no time to reprogram.
			You will need to physically change
			microchips the same time I program
			the correct instructions here.
			Captain, we have a plan.
			Proceed, and report at regular
			intervals.
			Someone must climb to the top.
			The circuits we need to change
			are in that panel.
			Whoever goes will be in more
			danger than falling. A great heat
			is generated in this chamber.
			Enough to disintegrate any of us
			in seconds.
			What about the doors, the ones
			we came in? If they stay open,
			would the system short out? Heat
			of that magnitude requires a seal
			of some sort, doesn't it?
			We cannot do it electronically.
			I need to use full power to
			reverse the effect.
			I will keep the doors from
			closing.
			Away team, report.
			Sir, we are executing the plan.
			You've got three minutes, no more.
			Transporter Room, lock onto their
			coordinates and be ready to beam
			them up the instant of my command.
			He's past the halfway mark.
			Captain, I need more time.
			You haven't got it.
			He's almost there.
			Go, Data.
			Remember Commander -- it is the
			blue chip you switch with the
			yellow chip.
			Ready, five, four, three, two,
			one.
			Beam them back.
			Did it work?
			It is well patched... Closed in
			this sense would be an equation...
			Patched is good enough.
			By my calculation, the laboratory
			just disintegrated.
			But this is amazing. All your
			readings are completely normal.
			There's even been a complete
			nerve regeneration.
			Where is my wife? Is Laura all
			right?
			Paul?
			The effect has been reversed,
			darling. It's safe now.
			There are no residual effects.
			No, Doctor, I am not the same man
			I was before.
			I still have the same vision, but,
			Captain Picard, I would like to
			request a science team to help
			me rebuild. I would like to start
			fresh, and do everything the right
			way this time.
			I'm sure the Federation will want
			to help you in any way they can,
			as long as you are willing to now
			be a part of the Federation.
			The science team will be arranged.
			All volunteers, I insist. No one
			on Vandor will be there unless
			they want to be there.
			I hope you don't mind. I
			convinced the technician you
			wouldn't.
			Oh, no, I won't be staying.
			I know.
			I wanted to say good-bye here,
			not in the Transporter Room.
			You have more courage than I did.
			More courage than a young man in
			first love, yes. More courage
			than Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of
			the USS Enterprise -- I doubt
			there are many who could boast
			that.
			I eat, sleep and dream your
			softness -- could it be enough?
			We would have been the richest,
			most gloriously happy two people
			in all the worlds.
			I cannot say good-bye to you.
			Is anything wrong?
			No, sir.
			Then set course for Sarona Eight.
			As I remember we were on our way
			for some much needed R and R.
			Aye, sir. Course set and laid in.
			Warp five. Engage.
			I've only been there once, but
			there's this great bar -- I can't
			remember the name of it, they
			serve these blue concoctions...
			... It's across the square from
			the Zanza Men's Dance Palace.
			It's called the Blue Parrot Cafe
			-- and you're buying.
