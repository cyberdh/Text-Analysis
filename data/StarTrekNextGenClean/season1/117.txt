			Captain's log, stardate 41463.9.
			We are mapping the Pleiades
			Cluster which has many young
			planets and we've been asked by
			the Federation to visit a group
			terraforming Velara III, which
			we would very much like to see.
			Communications have been erratic
			and there is some concern about
			their welfare.
			Entering standard orbit -- now.
			It takes special people to live
			in such desolation.
			Visionaries, who don't see this
			planet as it is, but as it will
			be.
			I've always wanted to see
			terraforming in operation.
			Hailing frequency, Lieutenant Yar.
			Hailing frequencies open, sir.
			Velara III base, this is Captain
			Picard of the starship Enterprise.
			Lieutenant Yar... ?
			No equipment malfunction on either
			end, sir. They are receiving.
			Velara III, this is the Enterprise.
			Come in please.
			Maybe nobody's home.
			We are sensing life-forms, sir.
			Velara III, do you copy?
			Velara Base to Enterprise. Uh...
			yes, Captain. Director Mandl
			here. Sorry for the delay. We
			weren't expecting visitors.
			Terraform Command has asked us
			to see how you were getting along.
			... We were a little behind, but
			we're back on schedule.
			We alarm him for some reason.
			Your staff is all well, I presume,
			Director?
			Understandably tired. We're all
			working very hard, Captain.
			Is there anything we can do to
			help?... You and your staff are
			welcome aboard for a change of
			scene and some rest. We have some
			Holodecks you might enjoy.
			No disrespect, sir, we can't
			afford to take the time.
			His fear is escalating.
			If you'll excuse me, I must get
			back to work.
			I sense deliberate concealment,
			sir.
			Of what?
			I don't know, but it's intense.
			We've heard so much about your
			remarkable achievements in
			terraforming, that my staff would
			very much appreciate looking
			around.
			... It's not really the best time.
			We are at a critical phase just
			now.
			We do not require any special
			attention.
			I'm trying not to be rude, sir,
			but it would be inconvenient just
			now.
			He's concealing something and it's
			more than just being too busy.
			Your announcement about coming
			down has pushed him almost to the
			point of panic.
			Whether he wants us or not...
			Director Mandl, unless you are
			absolutely refusing permission
			for us to land on your station,
			please prepare to receive my
			away team.
			As you wish.
			Stay on your toes, Number One.
			Counselor, perhaps you should go
			along. A man this tense is
			unpredictable.
			Welcome to Velara III. Remember
			it as it is now, because in a
			couple of decades you won't recognize
			the place.
			Luisa Kim. Gardener of Edens.
			Commander William Riker, USS
			Enterprise. This is Lieutenant
			Commander Data, Counselor Troi,
			Lieutenant Yar and Lieutenant
			LaForge.
			This is Bjorn Bensen, Chief
			Engineer, and Arthur Malencon,
			our Hydraulics Specialist,
			An android.
			And third in command of the
			Enterprise.
			Where were you manufactured --
			are there others like you?
			Both matters are subjects of
			protracted discussion.
			Remarkable.
			We don't get visitors. It's
			exciting to have you here.
			We weren't sure how we would be
			received. Director Mandl seemed
			less than enthusiastic about our
			interest.
			I should apologize for him. We
			are at a critical phase. Usually
			he's quite charming.
			We'll stay out of your way, it's
			just that we've never seen a
			terraforming station, and couldn't
			resist the opportunity.
			How much do you know about the
			process?
			The theories -- the reports -- but
			nothing firsthand.
			Oh, wonderful. Then let me show
			you around.
			The other two are as veiled and
			secretive as Mandl, but she is
			not.
			What we're doing is so exciting,
			so -- inspiring. We take a
			lifeless planet and little by
			little transform it into an
			M-class environment, capable of
			supporting life. Terraforming
			makes you feel a little godlike.
			Is that a terribly arrogant thing
			to say?
			Not at all. It is accurate.
			The first phase is selecting the
			planet. That's very important.
			It must have the right mass and
			gravity, the correct rate of
			rotation, and a balanced day and
			night. The planet must also be
			without life or having the
			prospect of life delveloping
			naturally. The Federation makes
			that decision. Then...
			... we take over.
			What you see here -- this station
			-- is Phase Two. Phase Three
			involves the water. Usually we
			create basins, using hydraulic
			landscaping, but the water on
			this planet is subsurface, and
			extremely high in salt content.
			We are just about to begin pumping
			and filtering that water,
			removing the salt, oxygenating
			and replacing. Next we introduce
			micro-organisms, and when the
			process is complete...
			... eventually, we'll have a
			lush, arable, biosphere.
			You make it sound poetic.
			I think it's the best occupation
			in the universe.
			The efficiency of your hydraulic
			landscaping is elegant.
			It isn't yet -- but it will be.
			Right now, I'm disturbed by
			erratic power surges in several
			of the servomechanisms that
			control the hydraulic probes.
			Could it be the increased
			conductivity caused by the high
			saline content?
			That was my first thought, but..
			Arthur.
			We checked that out. That wasn't
			it.
			I'm Director Mandl. I am sorry
			about being so abrupt during our
			initial contact, being isolated
			one tends to forget the social
			graces. Are you seeing everything
			you want?
			What you are doing here is
			miraculous.
			What we are doing here is working
			on a difficult, demanding
			timetable, and there will be no
			miracle unless Malencon gets the
			hydraulic probes back on line.
			We are set to step up to full
			conversion, immediately.
			Shouldn't you be in the hydraulics
			chamber, Arthur?
			Now?
			Yes.
			All right, Kurt.
			That must be the master subsurface
			pump. Impressive.
			This is interesting. How the
			water table is a thin ribbon
			between the sandy surface layer
			and the rock below.
			And it follows the contour precisely.
			Which would require extreme
			precision from the probe controls.
			Here's something which should
			interest you. The vegetation
			graphs are really the key element
			to successful terraforming.
			Incredible. It's planned month
			by month, decade by decade.
			Every single thing we do is
			specific and exacting. You see
			grand, romantic concepts. I see
			unyielding rock under an ocean
			of sand.
			Commander... !
			What is it, Deanna?
			Malencon. He's in trouble.
			Can you open it?
			It's jammed.
			Let me try.
			We're too late.
			Captain's log, supplemental. What
			began as a routine visit to the
			Federation group terraforming
			Velara III has become a serious
			situation. Arthur Malencon, the
			hydraulics engineer, has been
			killed in an extraordinary
			accident.
			Situation report, Number One.
			For safety reasons, we're shutting
			off all power to the hydraulics
			room before entering to recover
			the body. Then we'll beam him
			up to Sickbay, but from the look
			of his wounds, it's probably
			hopeless.
			Keep me informed.
			Data... ?
			Go ahead, Geordi.
			All set.
			We have your section powered down
			now. Bensen has locked the master
			servomotor drive system. It
			should be safe in there now.
			I'm going in.
			I will go with you.
			Transporter Room, this is
			Lieutenant Yar. Two to beam up
			to Sickbay.
			I want to go. We should be with
			him.
			Kurt, please come too.
			Transporter Room, this is
			Commander Riker. Beam up four
			at my coordinates.
			I have seen malfunctions, but
			this is unprecedented. Almost
			as if the laser drill attempted
			to tear itself apart.
			I can't explain it.
			The laser blasts seemed to end
			when the yelling stopped.
			Maybe Arthur stopped it -- only
			not in time.
			Not possible.
			Then what are you suggesting?
			Uncertain.
			Geordi, would you please return
			power to the control console in
			this room. I want to reactivate
			the program.
			I am running the base drilling
			program.
			Servos OFF!
			They are off!
			Data, what's happening?
			Too much to explain.
			LaForge to Enterprise. We have
			a problem!
			Open the door!
			STAY OUT! It is under control.
			Data --
			Are you injured?
			No.
			A year's work destroyed!
			I had no choice.
			Away team report now! What is
			happening?
			... We were attempting to trace
			the source of the malfunction when
			it attacked me.
			How much more of this fantasy must
			I listen to?
			None at all, Mr. Mandl. Until
			this is sorted out, I've provided
			temporary quarters for you and
			your crew. I suggest you use
			them.
			You're overstepping your
			authority, Picard! You have no
			right to interfere.
			An attack on one of my crew gives
			me the right, Mr. Mandl.
			I have a schedule to meet!
			Your schedule is on hold, until
			I have a satisfactory explanation
			of what happened.
			Director Mandl. Wait.
			Escort the director to his
			quarters.
			Aye, sir.
			Proceed with your report.
			It would appear that the laser
			drilling systems had been
			reprogrammed.
			As soon as its memory bank
			received power, it turned itself
			on and went after me.
			Fortunately, I was able to cope
			with it.
			Not by much, from what I saw.
			I believe it was programmed to
			destroy any person moving in that
			room.
			Speculation or certainty?
			Certainty.
			It would have required the talents
			of a master programmer.
			But it was done.
			Then the question is not who,
			because obviously it was one of
			the three remaining terraformers.
			The question is why. What are
			they hiding? What is so important
			it could make one of them, or all
			of them desperate enough to take
			a life?
			Shall I have them brought in, sir?
			Not yet.
			Doctor Crusher?
			Malencon never had a chance.
			The injuries were too severe, the
			damage too extensive.
			The entire Velara III facility
			has been powered down, Captain.
			We've just completed a remote
			power feed to the life support
			systems.
			Good. Data, I want you and Geordi
			to return for a more careful
			inspection.
			What are we to look for, sir?
			Evidence of tampering, negligence,
			sabotage... whatever. I don't
			know, but the answer's there, on
			the planet.
			Tasha, I'd like you to provide
			Counselor Troi and me with
			complete personnel files on our
			three guests. Psych profiles,
			training, everything. I'm looking
			for motive, intent... the
			psychological capacity to commit
			one murder and attempt another.
			Aye, sir.
			It seems we've become policemen,
			Number One.
			Geordi. I need some visual
			assistance.
			What is it?
			Inorganic. Nothing but basic
			elements. No carbon... sandy
			texture... But the flashes are
			almost... musical. I see color
			variations and rhythms which are
			like a melody.
			Speculation. Could it be alive?
			How could it be alive? It's
			inorganic.
			Whatever this is, it could be
			what they are covering up -- and
			the reason someone killed
			Malencon.
			Captain's log, supplemental. On
			my order, Data's startling
			discovery of a possible indigenous
			and inorganic life-form --
			something hitherto thought
			impossible...
			... has been beamed aboard so that
			its true nature might be
			uncovered.
			Activate.
			Let's be sure of what we have
			here.
			Is the sample organic?
			Negative carbon. Negative known
			life components. Substance
			inorganic.
			Recheck analysis.
			Rechecking... Analysis verified.
			Not organic.
			Magnify to screen.
			Magnify -- factor rate five.
			Hold surface. Rate ten.
			Hold.
			What are we looking at?
			It's really beautiful. Whatever
			it is...
			What's causing that hum?
			Computer, what is the magnification?
			Twenty five thousand diameters
			and holding.
			Analysis. The pattern of the
			flashes.
			Not random or repetitive or
			sequential. Pattern not
			recognized.
			What is the source of the flashes?
			Unable to specify. Theoretically
			not possible from this substance.
			Disregard incongruity and theorize
			as to source?
			Life.
			What do you mean a life-form?!
			What life-form?! A Federation
			recon expedition certified Velara
			III lifeless.
			Understandable, given this
			particular life-form's novel
			nature.
			And just what is that nature?
			Doctor Crusher is still making
			her determination.
			I presume you know the Prime
			Directive, Mr. Mandl.
			Are you saying I knowingly defied
			it?
			I don't know. But I intend to
			find out.
			You're a man obsessed with what
			he does. Who knows what an
			obsessed man would do to keep
			going? Kill, perhaps?
			I create life! I don't take it!
			What do you think?
			You hit him pretty hard, Captain.
			Counselor?
			It was useful.
			I felt two levels. He knew about
			the life-form. The idea of murder
			seemed to shock him. I couldn't
			tell if it was the whole idea,
			or just being accused of it.
			What about his file, Lieutenant
			Yar? Could he have accomplished
			the reprogramming that Data says
			took place?
			Mandl holds advanced degrees in
			Computer Science as well as
			Artificial Intelligence. It's
			possible.
			What about the others? Including
			the victim.
			Only the victim had the required
			expertise. But Malencon did work
			where the... whatever-it-is...
			was found. Trying to suppress
			that knowledge would be motive
			for murder... if Mandl were
			obsessed enough.
			Terraformers are often obsessive.
			It goes with the career profile.
			How do you read the designer?
			Possessed of a highly abstracted
			reality. Lovely visions, little
			data.
			You might do better than I.
			Luisa... are you all right?
			It isn't locked.
			Mind a visitor?
			Is it true... did you really find
			a life-form?
			It's still being debated in some
			quarters. But I think so, yes.
			What's it like?
			We have nothing to compare it to,
			but it's microscopic... seems
			colonial... simple... and
			inorganic.
			That's why the recon scouts missed
			it. This one wasn't your mistake.
			Everything I've worked for is
			falling apart.
			It's very beautiful. I'll arrange
			for you to see it, if you like.
			Perhaps later.
			Captain, this is Doctor Crusher.
			I think you'd better come to the
			Medical Lab.
			What is it?
			Geordi observed movement.
			It's not exactly movement, it's
			a shift in the energy pattern.
			Without external influence.
			Couldn't coordinated static
			charges promote the shift?
			Yes, if any were present in the
			jar, but none is.
			It's changing.
			I can't see any difference.
			The infrared range is increasing.
			Warning. Input overload. Input
			overload.
			It is projecting an energy field!
			And it's increasing!
			Only life can replicate itself,
			Doctor. Inorganic or not, it is
			alive.
			Activate quarantine field.
			Quarantine field full!
			Full shield backup!
			Translation request being patched.
			Translation? From whom?
			Evacuating lab.
			Full shield backup in place but
			weakening... translation grhjkj
			wljkdh...
			What's going on with the
			translator circuit?
			bridge, this is the captain.
			Request emergency power to
			increase lab quarantine seal...
			Do it, Mister Worf.
			What's the nature of the problem,
			Captain? We've lost visual.
			We have confirmed Data's discovery
			is life, but more than that - it
			is intelligent.
			How do you know?
			It has just taken possession of
			the Medical Lab.
			Because it's trying to communicate
			with us!
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			are attempting to deal with the
			aggressive inorganic life-form
			which Data brought up from the
			planet. It has taken over the
			Medical Lab, and is apparently
			attempting to communicate with
			us.
			It generates enough energy to
			interfere with surrounding
			systems.
			Mr. LaForge -- can we see into
			the lab yet?
			Negative, Captain. But, reducing
			backup to the quarantine seal
			might help.
			Doctor?
			I wouldn't.
			Continue backup to shield,
			Lieutenant.
			Director Mandl and the others are
			in the Observation Lounge as you
			requested.
			Counselor, I'll need you.
			You have the bridge, Number One.
			What do you know of this
			life-form?
			Nothing.
			You knew of its existence.
			Yes.
			Is this true?
			You knew there was life on Velara
			III?
			I knew there were random energy
			patterns -- I knew that. But
			that's not life. Not by any
			definition I have ever heard.
			But, you tried to hide that
			knowledge from us.
			They're meaningless silicon
			crystals, which rebroadcast sunlight.
			This is absurd.
			They are not only alive but they
			have intelligence.
			Why do you say that?
			They're trying to communicate
			with us.
			Communicate with you?
			I need information, now. When
			did you first see them? What
			were they doing? Why did you
			think they were alive?
			... There were patterns, in the
			sand, appearing and disappearing --
			Captain, we've regained a visual
			on the lab.
			Patch visual to Observation
			Lounge...
			I cannot understand the patterns.
			Neither can I.
			Please show me the spectral analysis.
			Magnification twelve K.
			But is it alive?!
			Probability positive...
			I wasn't asking you.
			Engineering to bridge.
			This is Commander Riker, go ahead.
			The backup on the lab seal is
			fluctuating, sir. I think you
			should come down here.
			On my way.
			Data, you have the bridge. Inform
			the captain.
			Status, Ensign?
			The quarantine seal is getting
			weaker. Every time I try to
			redirect backup... it goes
			somewhere else.
			I think I've... it's... locked
			three people in a turbolift and
			two more in the programmers' rest
			room.
			If that's reading right, there is
			no seal.
			Give me a lab interior image.
			Magnify.
			Captain, this is Riker.
			We see it too, Number One.
			Get that seal back up!
			No matter what I do, the energy
			goes somewhere else. What if it
			hits the Nursery... Or Sickbay... ?
			Hold off.
			Impossible, Captain. We haven't
			got the power.
			The Universal Translator is
			coming on line.
			Ugly... Ugly... Giants... Bags
			of Mostly Water...
			Bags of mostly water?
			An accurate description, sir, of
			humans. You are, after all, over
			ninety per cent water, surrounded
			by a flexible container.
			Do you understand me?
			We understand. We ask you be gone...
			We call... We talk... You not listen.
			We didn't hear you. We come in
			peace.
			Ugly Bag of Mostly Water... we try
			at peace... you still not listen.
			Bag in Dome on Sand of Home...
			we killed.
			It killed Malencon.
			We see and hear you now. We
			didn't know you were there. You
			are beautiful to us. All life is
			beautiful.
			Bag in dome did know. Made some
			of us die. Made us kill. War is
			now with you.
			Can you hear me?
			Duty stations! Report!
			Restabilizing, sir.
			Sir...
			What is it, Data?
			That chaos in the lab, when we
			were studying it... must have
			been the energy surge of a
			reproductive cycle.
			It is now a colony of single cells
			which organize as a computer.
			More is stronger.
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			We've stumbled on a life-form...
			... biologically and
			psychologically difficult for
			us to fully understand.
			The only thing totally clear is
			that this microbrain, as we've
			come to call it, has declared war
			on us.
			Their range of influence appears
			to be concentrated in the Medical
			Lab, Captain.
			All non-essential personnel have
			been moved to the most distant
			areas of the ship, sir.
			Data -- any analysis of those
			bolts of light they emit?
			That seems to be their method of
			reprogramming, Captain. Each bolt
			of light consists of negatively
			and positively charged ions. A
			series of program instructions,
			as it were.
			They seem to have a quicker
			rapport with our computers than
			we do.
			What do you expect? They are
			computers.
			Have we disabled the Medical Lab
			computer console?
			Aye, sir, as soon as Data
			determined the microbrain's method
			of operation.
			I am picking up a decrease in the
			infra-red intensity.
			Maybe the life-form has reached
			its own energy limit.
			Or maybe this is not the end of
			it.
			With single-celled life-forms...
			at least organic ones, cell
			division can be preceded by a
			resting state.
			The calm before the storm.
			Let's use the calm. Medical Lab
			on main viewer.
			It does seem dormant.
			Lieutenant Yar - set coordinates
			to beam it back where it came
			from.
			Coordinates set.
			Energize!
			Transporter power has been
			redirected, sir. We are unable
			to affect it.
			Life-form or not... intelligent
			or not -- the safety of this ship
			and all on her are my primary
			responsibility.
			Data -- evacuate the air from the
			Medical Lab. I want a vacuum in
			there.
			Environmental systems fail to
			respond to commands, Captain.
			It appears the microbrain has
			successfully interfaced with our
			computer.
			Suggestions?
			Anyone?
			I need your help. We have
			communicated with the life-form
			discovered on Velara III.
			You have what?!
			It has told us that it attempted
			to communicate with you, and you
			ignored it.
			If it was trying to communicate
			with us, we didn't understand
			that.
			We didn't try.
			What you were doing was so
			threatening to them that they
			killed your hydraulics engineer
			to stop it. They have declared
			a state of war.
			A state of war?!
			Yes, and we're on the defensive.
			I need your help. I have to find
			some way to fight them. We no
			longer have control of the Medical
			Lab, or the computer. At this
			moment they have the power to
			destroy this ship and everyone
			on it.
			Unbelievable. What can we do
			to help?
			They said you killed some of them.
			I need to know how.
			I -- I don't know.
			Exactly what was Malencon doing
			when he was killed?
			There is a very thin layer of
			highly saline water under the
			sandy topsoil. He was siphoning
			that off.
			Why would that kill some of them?
			Liquid supports life. Perhaps
			somehow, that saline water
			sustained them.
			It connected them.
			I don't understand.
			The microbrains are like our brain
			cells. Individually a cell has
			life -- but not intelligence -- yet
			when interconnected their combined
			intelligence is formidable.
			So that saline fluid is their
			circuitry.
			And to prevent its loss, they
			killed Malencon.
			If we had continued to remove the
			water... we would have destroyed
			them all.
			Reason enough for anyone to go
			to war.
			Captain -- it's happening again!
			If this keeps up, that thing will
			tear the Enterprise apart!
			Captain -- sensors indicate the
			microbrain expends a tremendous
			amount of energy during its
			reproduction cycle. Yet, there
			is no discernible power drain from
			our own systems.
			Then what's feeding the damn
			thing!?
			Data and I found traces of
			cadmium salts. Cadmium is a
			conduit for converting infra-red
			into electricity.
			Meaning?
			Meaning the microbrains might be
			photoelectric.
			Okay, let's see if darkness will
			neutralize them. Kill the lights
			in the lab, Mr. LaForge. We can
			at least do that.
			Sorry, Captain, can't do it by
			remote.
			Number One...
			On my way.
			The creatures must have evolved
			at that narrow layer where the
			light got through the sand to the
			water... Drop the water a
			centimeter below the light
			penetration level and they starve.
			Kill lab lights -- now!
			It's slowing down.
			Getting dimmer, too.
			We copy fine now... more light
			please...
			Darkness death terrible. Go home
			to warm sand...
			War over.
			We are happy to agree with you.
			Riker to Transporter Chief. Pick
			up the coordinates of the bell
			jar in the Medical Lab for return
			to Velara III.
			... Coordinates entered, sir.
			Riker to bridge. Captain, we're
			ready to beam it back to the
			planet.
			I wish we were able to learn more
			about them.
			In time, Mr. Data. When we're
			better prepared.
			Our apologies.
			And our respect.
			Lieutenant Yar...
			Coordinates set, sir.
			Energize!
			Captain's log, stardate 41464.2.
			Declaring indefinite quarantine
			for the Velara System...
			... Returning to starbase with
			surviving Terraformers.
