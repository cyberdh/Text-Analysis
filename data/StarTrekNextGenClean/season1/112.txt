			Captain's log, stardate 41309.5.
			We are in orbit around Persephone
			V where I have been sent to confer
			with Admiral Mark Jameson in
			regard to an extraordinary
			situation....
			Starfleet received this subspace
			transmission two days ago,
			Admiral.
			Let's see it, Captain.
			On screen and relay to the
			admiral, Mister Data.
			I am Karnas, governor of Mordan
			IV. A dissident terrorist group
			has taken Federation Ambassador
			Hawkins and his staff hostage.
			They will not discuss terms with
			me. This is a crisis I cannot
			resolve without assistance. The
			terrorists are demanding a
			Federation negotiator.
			I feel there is only one
			negotiator with the skills and
			understanding to resolve this
			situation. The hostages' lives
			will depend on Starfleet
			delivering this man to Mordan.
			Commander Mark Jameson.
			Admiral Jameson. The terrorists
			have given you six Earth days to
			arrive here -- or the hostages
			will die. Please...hurry.
			Starfleet doesn't understand how
			or why this situation developed.
			Mordan IV has finally gained peace
			after decades of civil war --
			Forty years of civil war, Captain.
			Yes, sir. Karnas was largely
			responsible for the planet's
			unification and peace. Why
			should he suddenly be unable to
			deal with rebellious factions?
			Forty-five years ago I negotiated
			a hostage situation on Mordan.
			Karnas was a young man then....
			... but so was I. He seems to feel
			I can handle the situation again.
			Obviously Starfleet feels that
			way too, or you wouldn't be here.
			I'm detailed to take you to Mordan
			IV as soon as you can be ready,
			Admiral.
			My wife and I will beam aboard
			at 1500 hours, Captain. Be
			prepared to depart this starbase
			and proceed immediately to Mordan
			IV. Acknowledge.
			Received and acknowledged, sir.
			Picard out.
			Nearly 1500 now, sir.
			Well, Number One. Why don't we
			go and welcome the admiral aboard?
			Admiral Jameson, sir. Have you
			met him before?
			Your hero, Number One?
			Not only mine. My father served
			on the Falcon with him. I grew
			up on stories about Mark Jameson.
			I've heard all the legends about
			him, too. Not only the Falcon's
			missions and the Mordan rescue,
			but the Gettysburg's explorations,
			his command of the old Pegasus
			in the Klingon conflicts....
			Welcome aboard, Admiral.
			My executive officer, Commander
			William Riker.
			My pleasure, sir.
			Ma'am.
			My wife, Anne.
			Captain, there are certain details
			of this mission that you should
			understand before we begin.
			Is this the place to be discussing
			them, sir?
			Why not? You and your first
			officer are both here.
			Yes, sir.
			Captain, I am not simply an
			advisor. On any assignment I
			accompany, Starfleet has
			designated me Senior Mission
			Officer. I control the Away Team
			and all its actions. Is that
			understood?
			Of course, Captain, you will
			command the ship -- but the
			mission is mine. I trust you
			are in complete agreement.
			Yes, sir. Of course.
			Response to our message coming
			in from Mordan, sir.
			Put it on the screen, Mister Data.
			Mordan IV to Enterprise. This
			is Karnas. I will speak to the
			captain.
			I am Captain Picard, in command
			of the Enterprise.
			Is Admiral Jameson on board?
			He is here, beside my first
			officer. Do you wish to speak
			to him now?
			So, Jameson.
			I see time has not been kind.
			It seldom is, Karnas. However,
			we could save a good deal of it
			now if you'll outline the
			terrorists' demands....
			They insist all discussions will
			take place here... on Mordan. They
			refuse to speak to me -- only to
			you.
			They could relay their terms on
			your communications channels....
			They insist on speaking face to
			face when you arrive. They say
			they will brook no excuses. If
			there are any offered, your
			ambassador and his people will
			die. Unpleasantly. I believe
			them -- and so should you,
			Admiral.
			Tell them I accept the conditions
			of negotiation.
			I will do so immediately. Karnas
			out.
			For a man in his position, Karnas
			doesn't seem to know much about
			the situation.
			Wrong, Number One. He told me
			the terrorists are desperate
			enough to kill if they're crossed.
			They're willing to talk one on
			one, but not to him.
			Counselor?
			From his body language as well
			as his words and tone... I'd judge
			that what Karnas said was honest,
			but I sensed a holding back.
			Perhaps he knows more about the
			terrorists than he is willing to
			admit.
			Possible, but I suspect it's
			closer to the mark if we said he
			doesn't want to admit failure of
			his own efforts to negotiate.
			He is a proud man.
			That could be, sir. Karnas has
			established himself as a powerful
			man on Mordan. Suddenly -- in
			this situation -- his power is
			useless.
			Sickbay to bridge. I am ready
			for Admiral Jameson now.
			He is on his way, Doctor.
			On my way to what, Captain?
			Just a routine medical checkup.
			Ship's regulations.
			Pardon me, sir, but refusing a
			simple medical check --
			I'm sorry, Doctor, but it isn't
			necessary.
			The chief medical officer on
			Starbase 45 ran a complete battery
			of tests on me two days ago.
			Semi-annual exam. You'll find
			I've been a victim of Iverson's
			Disease for five years. My
			"case," as you doctors like to
			call it, is now chronic. In
			another year, it will undoubtedly
			progress to terminal.
			I'm sorry --
			No need. I do not accept the
			prognosis, Doctor. But right now,
			I don't have time to waste, and
			there's no point in you wasting
			your time either.
			There's your information.
			Thank you, Admiral. I'll look
			them over.
			What I don't understand, sir, is
			how Karnas knew you were still...
			available.
			Still alive, you mean.
			So far as Karnas knew, you might
			have been dead, sir.
			Quite right, Commander. But I'm
			not, and I imagine Ambassador
			Hawkins told him that. I briefed
			the ambassador about Mordan
			before he left to take up
			residence.
			All right. Karnas has a problem
			he feels you can handle. What
			can the terrorists want that
			Karnas can't or won't give them?
			Mordan has had peace for five
			years. They have finally come
			to a state of productivity that
			satisfies their planetary needs,
			but no more than that. Perhaps
			the dissidents feel the Federation
			can provide more -- technology,
			science, agricultural
			assistance....
			I've negotiated many a treaty on
			many planets, Picard. I've found
			that peace -- or the appearance
			of it -- is often a prelude to
			war.
			Admiral are you suggesting the
			terrorists want arms and weapons?
			They may. I am suggesting Karnas
			is the last man to give them such
			weapons.
			Karnas worked and fought for
			years to achieve peace.
			And he's not likely to throw it
			away... even for the lives of the
			hostages.
			I see. You believe Karnas won't
			negotiate on that point, so the
			terrorists demanded an outside
			negotiator.
			I know Karnas. He is a warrior...
			he lives for challenge. These
			people have insulted his honor
			by taking the embassy staff
			hostage. I'll negotiate -- but
			I'll have to be very careful in
			handling Karnas. He'll want
			revenge for that insult.
			... You're late. Couldn't get away
			from the bridge?
			Didn't want to. It feels good
			to be on one again.
			I'm glad, Mark.
			Do you want me to help you up?
			You're stronger today...
			I'm fine. Feel like a kid again.
			This ship is magnificent. Pity
			we didn't have them twenty, thirty
			years ago. We could have been
			together almost all of your
			career.
			It's so good to be able to be with
			you now.
			Mark! I'll call Sickbay --
			No! There's no need. It's
			happened before --
			When? You haven't said anything
			--
			It'll pass... give me a moment....
			See... I'm better. It's going
			away.
			What is it? Do the doctors know?
			Just body changes... My last
			checkup, they said I'd have to
			expect it.
			You're sure? Don't lie to me.
			I'm sure.
			... All the medical information
			the admiral provided is
			satisfactory, sir....
			Excellent, Doctor --
			Except for one thing.
			The test results he gave me aren't
			two days old, they're two months
			old. The medical file coder
			always includes the date as part
			of the file number. He lied to
			me, sir -- and I don't know why.
			He is eighty years old, Doctor.
			For some, the memory begins to
			fail....
			He suffers from Iverson's Disease,
			sir. It affects the body -- not
			the mind. I just have a gut
			feeling he's hiding something.
			I'd expect that observation from
			Counselor Troi, but --
			I respect your opinion, Doctor.
			And I'll want you on the bridge
			for the next day or so. The
			admiral has to remain in the best
			of health for these negotiations.
			He might require your services.
			Captain's personal log... I am
			puzzled and somewhat concerned
			by the dating error Admiral
			Jameson made on his medical
			records.
			Admiral, we're approaching the
			Idini Star Cluster. Would you
			like to take the Conn as we make
			transit?
			Thank you, Captain. I would.
			Well, Admiral. Quite a little
			surprise you've pulled on us.
			Yes. Quite.
			Neglected to mention... I began
			some new therapy before I left.
			Seems to be working. I haven't
			felt this good since the last time
			I was in space. The Gettysburg.
			All I needed to get me out of that
			chair was the thought of walking
			the decks in command of a starship
			again.
			Admiral... you only have the Conn
			temporarily.
			Figure of speech. Of course she's
			your ship.
			I'll just keep an eye on her for
			a while.
			The admiral displayed a remarkable
			improvement out there, wouldn't
			you say?
			Captain, no one recovers from
			Iverson's Disease. There is no
			known cure, and there are no cases
			where it has gone into remission.
			I haven't heard of any new
			therapy that would have results
			like this.
			Then how do you account for it?
			I can't. All I can tell you is
			that the admiral has been confined
			to the support chair for four
			years by the effects of Iverson's.
			By all the medical facts we know,
			he should never have walked again.
			I'd like you to look into it,
			Doctor. Thoroughly.
			Yes, sir.
			The terrorists have given you
			six Earth days to bring him here
			-- or the hostages will die.
			Please...hurry.
			I don't know how much more
			information you think you can get
			out of that tape.
			Mark... ? My God... what happened?
			It's a new therapy I've been
			taking. It's -- working, Anne.
			Oh, Mark!
			Mark... ?
			I told you I just needed to get
			back into space again.
			You're really looking much
			better....
			It's the new treatment.
			No... come here....
			I hope you're heading for the
			bedroom.
			Stop it, Mark.
			Mark, you look like you did twenty
			years ago.
			You're flattering me.
			Mark, what the hell is going on?
			I don't know what --
			Mark!
			Sickbay! Medical emergency in
			the admiral's quarters!
			I've found traces of chemical
			substances in his blood and tissue
			samples, but none of them are in
			our pharmacopeia. We're still
			working on alien references to
			substances like these. All I can
			say is that he ingested something
			that's strongly affecting his
			body.
			Specifics, Doctor.
			Captain, there are so many things
			going on here, I can't be positive
			without a lot more tests.
			Give me what you have now.
			His red cell count is running
			riot. Then there's the cellular
			structure of his body tissue.
			It's -- changing. I can't even
			begin on that until I see what
			it's changing to. His DNA is all
			skewed. I don't know how it's
			possible, but he even looks
			younger. And Captain... there
			is absolutely no sign of Iverson's
			Disease.
			You said there is no cure for
			Iverson's.
			None we know of. Whatever else
			these substances are doing to his
			body, at least they've done that
			for him. But how or why, I can't
			say on the information I have now.
			Get me some answers, Doctor. As
			soon as possible.
			Yes, sir.
			Captain....
			There are some questions I have
			to ask the admiral, Mrs. Jameson.
			Ask away. There's nothing to hide
			now.
			Admiral -- in addition to your
			rank, you are a particularly
			valuable commodity just now.
			Starfleet has a right to some
			answers.
			I'd been planning this for a long
			time -- ever since I learned I
			had Iverson's Disease. Since it
			put me in that chair.
			What did you do, Mark?
			There's a planet in the Cerberus
			system -- Cerberus II -- they say
			the natives have a process that
			rejuvenates the body... gives you
			your youth back.
			I've heard that story, too. It's
			a myth.
			It's true, Picard. I'm the living
			proof. Oh, it's dangerous -- the
			mortality rate is high -- and it's
			painful.
			Very painful. Aliens are seldom
			allowed to obtain the process,
			but I managed it. I negotiated
			a treaty for Cerberus II several
			years ago, and they felt obligated
			to honor my request for the
			process.
			Obviously it works rapidly. How
			does it work?
			The herb and drug combinations
			are self-administered... slowly,
			over a period of two years. Every
			response is different, depending
			on a being's DNA.
			I got enough for both of us, Anne
			-- but I had to test it on myself
			first. I couldn't risk you. If
			I died... well, I was half a man
			anyway, to what did it matter... ?
			It would matter to me.
			But I was starting to change,
			Anne. It was almost undetectable,
			but the improvement was there.
			Then this hostage situation came
			up, and I knew I'd have to be at
			my peak to deal with it. I
			didn't have time to wait for the
			drugs to work naturally --
			You took the whole dose.
			I took both of them. And look
			at me! Annie, look at me. I'm
			strong, alert, I'm fit. I'm
			fitter than you are, Picard. And
			I'm getting younger!
			The only question I have, Admiral,
			is why you felt it necessary to
			be young to negotiate the hostage
			release. Surely Karnas requested
			you because of your age and
			experience.
			I'll be on the bridge, Admiral,
			if you wish to talk further.
			Why didn't you tell me, Mark?
			We've always been honest with each
			other -- until now.
			Annie, I did it for us.
			I'm sure you believed that --
			until you had a chance to head
			up a mission... to command again.
			Then you just upended the bottle
			-- or whatever it was -- and damn
			all. Did you think about me at
			all?
			I got enough of the dosage for
			both of us....
			But you never asked if I wanted
			it. It's just like you, Mark,
			to assume that what you felt was
			right was the only answer.
			It was the right answer for me.
			It was killing you, having to take
			care of an invalid. What good
			was I to you? Annie -- we can
			be together again....
			Let me go!
			I can get another supply of the
			drug for you --
			Commander Data, I wish to open
			a communication frequency to
			Karnas.
			Aye, sir.
			A moment, Mister Data. Admiral,
			this is Picard. May I know the
			purpose of this communication?
			Karnas must have tried to
			negotiate with the terrorists
			before he was forced to call on
			me. I want all the information
			he has access to.
			You said he was a proud man...
			probably sensitive about his
			failure to deal with the
			situation. Is it wise to press
			him on this?
			I'm the negotiator, Picard.
			Karnas will have to cooperate
			with me and the terrorists, and
			damn his sensitivities.
			Then I suggest a secured channel,
			Admiral.
			A sensible precaution, Picard.
			Make it so.
			Aye, sir. Frequency open and
			secured.
			Karnas.
			What is it you want, Admiral?
			We're on a secured channel,
			Karnas. You can talk freely.
			Who's behind this thing? You said
			dissidents.
			Yes... political opponents who feel
			the Federation will disavow me
			as governor if they stir up enough
			trouble on Mordan.
			Then who is it? Ardan? Gilnor?
			They're dead, Jameson. A long
			time now. For a long time I
			thought you were dead, too.
			I almost died a couple of times
			on missions, but I always made
			it through somehow.
			Yes. Now you're coming back to
			Mordan -- to negotiate for
			hostages again. It's almost as
			though the forty-five years
			between never happened....
			You've never forgiven me.
			Should I have -- after the legacy
			of war you left us in your last
			"negotiation?"
			There are no dissidents, are
			there? No terrorists. You have
			the hostages.
			And if I have? You're coming to
			Mordan, Jameson. You're going
			to negotiate for their lives, and
			I'm going to ask a very high price
			for them.
			What if I refuse?
			Then the hostages will die.
			You've seen how my executioners
			work. They are still as efficient
			as they were... perhaps even more
			skilled now. You'll come -- even
			if you don't have much honor left.
			Karnas out.
			Are we still on schedule to arrive
			at Mordan in thirty-eight hours?
			Yes, sir. We're at warp four now.
			Picard, I want a jump to warp eight
			so we arrive ahead of our announced
			ETA. It'll throw Karnas off balance,
			and we can catch him before he's
			ready.
			Ready for exactly what, Admiral?
			I believe Karnas is planning
			something new... something that
			will directly endanger the
			hostages' lives.
			What happened in your
			communication to bring you to that
			conclusion? It seems a big
			jump....
			I'm not at liberty to say, Picard,
			but negotiation is not the answer
			or the issue here. The hostages'
			lives are at stake.
			I agree the most important thing
			is saving the lives of the
			hostages...
			And you agree with that, too,
			Riker?
			I do, sir.
			Good. Because I plan to
			personally lead an away team on
			an armed rescue mission to get
			them out of there.
			Commander Data, will you bring
			up the plans I requested on the
			Viewscreen, please.
			Yes, sir.
			Most of Mordan's principal city
			was devastated in the war. What
			was left consisted of a network
			of underground tunnels -- a rat's
			maze. When they rebuilt the city,
			they simply built over the
			tunnels.
			I have it, sir.
			Admiral, even if you're right
			about Karnas being behind this,
			he still wants to negotiate. Or
			at least to talk. Why not hear
			what he has to say?
			I've heard what he has to say,
			and I have good reason to believe
			he's lying.
			Pardon me, sir, but where do these
			come into the picture?
			This is where Karnas held his
			hostages before and where I
			believe he has them now.
			Wouldn't that be a little too
			obvious, Admiral?
			Karnas is a dogged strategist,
			Picard -- not a brilliant one.
			He sticks to what works.
			An overt rescue attempt could push
			Karnas into killing the hostages
			outright.
			I don't think that's what he
			wants, Picard.
			Then what does he want?
			Maybe his threats are just a way
			to bargain for what he wants....
			Karnas means exactly what he
			says, Lieutenant. He will kill
			the hostages if we don't get them
			out of there.
			Therefore you see an armed raid
			as our only option.
			You don't agree.
			I would point out no one else has
			heard or considered Karnas's
			demands but you, Admiral. The
			Federation might take a different
			view of them if they knew what
			they were.
			Starfleet gave me command of the
			away team, Picard. I intend to
			use them as I see fit.
			Is Jameson physically able to lead
			an away mission, Doctor?
			His cells, his tissue, even his
			bones are still de-aging, but I'd
			say he was. Generally, I'd call
			Admiral Jameson a healthy
			man... about forty-five... in
			excellent physical condition.
			What about his mind?
			The same. Brain scan reveals all
			cells and tissue are changing,
			but healthy. No loss of
			memory... exellent grasp of facts.
			Counselor?
			Certainly his physical capacities
			have been restored. I sense that
			gives him great satisfaction.
			When he came aboard, he seemed
			hopeful, eager. Now there seems
			to be a harder, more forceful
			attitude... ambition....
			More of a young man's attitude,
			I'd say. Aggressive... going right
			for the throat of a situation
			instead of considering the
			alternatives.
			Part of that is ambition too.
			He wants to be the man he once
			was. He is the man he once was,
			but sometimes old memories aren't
			very accurate. He was able to
			lead away teams like this once.
			Now he believes he can do it
			again.
			Our anniversary is next week.
			Fifty years....
			In his heart, he's still the same
			man you married, Anne.
			That's true. He still cares for
			you, despite the physical changes
			he's undergoing.
			But he's getting younger, and I'm
			-- well, look at me. Why did he
			do this... ?
			There are lives at stake, Mrs.
			Jameson.
			What about our lives? Mine and
			his, together?
			Anne... I think I know a little
			of what you're feeling. My
			husband died on an away mission.
			We'd been married two years. So
			little time. Look at what you've
			had with Mark --
			Years, yes -- but not together.
			I was looking forward to time
			together finally -- our
			retirement. Now he's young again
			and has a life to live over.
			She has to know, Doctor.
			Know what?
			Anne... he's --
			What is it?
			He's not stabilizing.
			He may not have that life to live
			over.
			We'll be at Mordan in three hours.
			I couldn't sleep either.
			I never could before a mission.
			Always wound up in the Observation
			Lounge, staring out at the stars.
			Thinking.
			Maybe in this case rethinking?
			Perceptive. They always have
			given you high marks for that at
			Starfleet, Picard.
			Why is this mission so important
			to you? Why did you risk your
			life so you could lead it
			personally?
			I want to save lives, Picard.
			Noble sentiment -- but too easy
			an answer. You've been here
			before. You negotiated a release
			of hostages with Karnas before.
			Why is it now your answer is an
			armed raid?
			It's my away team you're going
			to send in. There's something
			you're not telling me, and I have
			a right to know what it is.
			Do you know the background? The
			Mordanites had some
			sophistication, but were still
			ruled by tribal family units.
			Karnas's father was the ruling
			chief of one of the families, and
			another tribe had him
			assassinated. Karnas seized the
			passengers of a starliner and
			held them hostage, demanding that
			Starfleet provide him with weapons
			that would enable him to defeat
			his rivals.
			That's the official record.
			Officially the story is that after
			two other mediators were
			murdered, I went in and negotiated
			with Karnas to bring out the
			hostages safely.
			Are you saying that's not the
			truth?
			It wasn't my golden oratory that
			saved them, Picard. I gave Karnas
			the weapons he wanted.
			You did what?
			I gave exactly the same weapons
			to his rivals. My interpretation
			of the Prime Directive. Let them
			solve their problems with those
			arms on an equal basis.
			That decision plunged them into
			forty years of civil war.
			I didn't know that would happen.
			I thought, a minor war -- it'll
			be settled in less than a year.
			How could I know it would be four
			decades? I falsified the reports
			to Starfleet, but I've lived with
			that on my soul, Picard.
			Sixty-three people came away safe
			-- but millions died on Mordan
			because I delivered those weapons.
			Karnas could have worked for peace
			all those years instead of
			continuing the war. It's not all
			on your head, Admiral.
			But I started it. I lit the
			match. Now, finally, I can
			vindicate myself, if only in a
			small way. I came to negotiate,
			but that isn't what Karnas wants.
			Revenge. That's why he demanded
			you when he found out you were
			still alive.
			I'm not going to give it to him,
			Picard. I'm going to do what I
			should have done the first time.
			We're taking the hostages out
			by force. No deals.
			Prepare to energize, Chief.
			Belay that.
			Admiral, the correct place for
			you is on the bridge...
			I will remind you one more time,
			Picard, I am the Senior Mission
			Commander, and I'm leading this
			team.
			Sir?
			The Admiral is correct, Number
			One. He has that right. But I'm
			the captain of this ship, and I
			have it, too. You have command
			of the Enterprise, Commander
			Riker.
			Energize.
			Yes...perfect. We are in the M-4
			tunnel directly under the
			governor's residence. M-4 is a
			subsidiary tunnel, but it crosses
			and links with several main ones.
			I am sorry, sir. That does not
			correspond with the information
			I have on the tricorder, sir.
			Your information is incorrect,
			Commander. I know these tunnels
			like the back of my own hand.
			That way. It takes us to the
			hatch that will let us into M-1
			tunnel. Keep scanning for signs
			of human life forms. Karnas held
			his hostages in these tunnels
			before. He'll do it again.
			The admiral is definitely
			incorrect, Captain. The tunnel
			schematics we have indicate this
			is a dead end. It was sealed off
			two years ago....
			I've no doubt you're right, Mister
			Data. However, forty-five years
			ago, I'm sure it linked in with
			the tunnels Admiral Jameson
			remembers.
			Steelplast. Fairly recent
			installation.
			Damn. This is the most direct
			route. Set phasers to cut through
			it.
			If you have the coordinates for
			where you think the hostages are,
			sir, we could just beam in there.
			But Karnas might not have them
			in the same place. There is no
			substitute for a personal
			reconnoiter, Lieutenant.
			No, sir.
			Admiral, there's an infrared light
			signal ahead. Steady beam,
			straight across the tunnel, chest
			high. Another at hip level.
			An alarm trigger or --
			Reset phasers to stun.
			Look out, sir!
			Their phasers, sir -- set on
			kill.
			Thank you, Mister Data. I have
			heard the sound before.
			Is he hit?
			I cannot tell --
			Enterprise, this is Picard. Five
			to beam up -- now!
			How badly is he hurt?
			I do not see any sign of a wound,
			sir.
			It appears to be another attack,
			sir.
			Call Doctor Crusher here
			immediately.
			Sir.
			Transporter Room Three to Sickbay.
			Doctor Crusher, please report
			immediately with Medical Support
			Team.
			This last attack is the worst one
			he's suffered, sir. The others
			were overwith fairly quickly.
			He hasn't recovered from this one
			yet, and nothing has been able
			to relieve his pain.
			Do you have any answers, Doctor?
			I'm afraid none of it is very
			hopeful. The compound he took
			seems to be rejuvenating the DNA,
			but it's also sloughing off the
			old cells too fast for his body
			to cope. His body is trying to
			grow and die and regenerate all
			at the same time.
			You're saying the overdose of
			the drug he took is working too
			well.
			Exactly, sir.
			When will it stop?
			It won't... because it can't.
			Eventually, he won't be able to
			stand the strain.
			The admiral... ?
			Sickbay. "Not good" is a galactic
			understatement.
			Karnas again, sir. On the screen.
			Enterprise. There has been an
			armed intrusion in the tunnels
			beneath the city. That smells
			of Jameson. Where is he?
			This is Picard. I am sorry to
			inform you that the admiral is
			critically ill, Karnas.
			That is not my concern. Sick or
			well, you have ten minutes to beam
			him down, Captain Picard.
			Otherwise, the hostages die.
			Sickbay to bridge.
			Picard.
			Doctor Crusher requests your presence
			in Sickbay immediately, sir.
			On my way.
			What is it?
			You'd better see for yourself.
			Picard....
			Picard, I have to get to Karnas.
			I can't allow him out of my care,
			sir.
			My last option, Picard. The raid
			failed... all I have left to
			bargain with is myself....
			Bridge to Picard.
			Picard here. What is it, Number
			One?
			A new demand from Karnas, sir.
			If we don't deliver Jameson in
			five minutes, a hostage will be
			executed. Fifteen minutes after
			that, another.
			He promises the method of
			execution will be both slow and
			painful.
			Let me go. If I turn myself over
			to him, he'll let the hostages
			go. It's me he wants.
			It's certain death for you,
			Admiral.
			My life for how many hostages,
			Picard? Twenty?
			Let me go.
			Number One, inform Karnas we'll
			be beaming down in less than five
			minutes.
			"We," sir?
			You have your orders, Number One.
			Aye, sir. Riker out.
			Captain, you can't go down there
			again --
			Jameson... ?
			Yes. Exactly why I have to go,
			Will. As a Starfleet captain,
			I have negotiating powers.
			Energize.
			Who are you! I want Jameson!
			This is Admiral Mark Jameson.
			This charade will accomplish
			nothing, Picard. Beam Jameson
			down, and the hostages will be
			freed. Continue this -- and I
			promise you they will die -- and
			you with them.
			Karnas, if you'll just listen....
			Why have you brought him here?
			This is no place for children.
			Peretor Karnas. You always were
			a stubborn man. I thought you
			wanted me. I'm here. Release
			the hostages. now.
			"Peretor" was my old title. Why
			do you call me that?
			Because you're acting like the
			warrior you were -- not like the
			planetary governor you are.
			Picard, I warn you, this trick
			is going too far. He has been
			coached... for some devious
			reason. If this farce is not
			stopped immediately, you and the
			hostages will be put to death.
			Admiral!
			I'm waiting for an explanation,
			Captain.
			He is the admiral. Before we left
			on this mission, he administered
			an overdose of an alien de-aging
			drug to himself. He wanted to
			face you with strength again... on
			even terms. This is what the drug
			has done to him.
			This story you are telling is
			unbelievable. Jameson is a man
			of eighty, not --
			-- this. I want that old man,
			Picard. I want to show him this
			world he helped to make... the
			scars on old soldiers' bodies...
			the graveyards of our young
			dead... the wasted cities we are
			still rebuilding... and all of
			it caused by him.
			As I understand the facts, Karnas,
			you were the one who demanded
			weapons to avenge your father's
			death.
			But Jameson didn't give weapons
			only to us. If he had, we would
			have triumphed over our enemies
			in less than a year, and we would
			have had peace in all these
			decades. When Jameson gave
			weapons to both sides, he gave
			us forty years of war. I want
			him to pay for that, Picard.
			Sir, I think Mrs. Jameson should
			beam down. Now.
			Do it.
			Karnas, I've asked Doctor Crusher
			to bring down the visual records
			we've made of Admiral Jameson's
			deterioration. Will you look at
			them?
			You're wasting my time, Picard.
			Only a few moments.
			You saw Admiral Jameson when he
			was on board en route to Mordan?
			Yes.
			You recognized him?
			Yes.
			And this is the man you saw.
			Yes. This is the man I want.
			Never again, Karnas.
			Once he took the compound ... there
			was no way to stop it.
			You'll have to deal with me,
			Karnas. Whatever you wanted from
			Jameson isn't possible any more.
			You wanted revenge, Karnas. You
			blamed your war on Jameson, and
			there's no doubt he had a lot to
			do with it. But you had the
			weapons, and you used them. You
			could have tried for negotiations
			for peace on your planet long ago.
			You chose to fight instead. How
			many of those forty years of war
			are on your head?
			Jameson has to pay for his
			crimes... I have sworn it to my
			people. When I found out he was
			alive, I gave them my word I would
			kill him for what he did. A public
			execution... public retribution
			for what he did to us.
			Then there's Jameson. He wanted
			to atone for what he'd done here.
			Forty-five years ago, he made the
			wrong decision, and he wanted to
			come here to somehow right it.
			He wanted to negotiate, and when
			that failed, he decided to fight.
			Your men foiled that, and all he
			has left now is to give himself
			up to you. He's brought this
			retribution on himself.
			No. I don't believe you. You
			are shielding Jameson on the ship
			and telling me this tale to save
			his life.
			Peretor Karnas... there were only
			two of us in the meeting. You
			didn't even trust your lieutenants
			then. You told me old Peretor
			Sain had ordered your father's
			assassination. You told me you
			wanted arms to destroy him. Peace
			wasn't on your mind. You just
			wanted revenge. And I gave you
			the weapons to do it.
			Jameson told you all this.
			I am Jameson. Do you want a list
			of the weapons I gave you? Only
			you and I would know what it was,
			because I erased every trace of
			them from the records.
			Jameson still could have told you
			this.
			If you are him, show me the scar.
			There. The blood cut you gave
			me to seal our bargain.
			It is you. Somehow... it is you.
			Then die by one of your own
			weapons!
			No. My revenge is in letting
			you live like this.
			Such pain....
			Doctor Crusher?
			His body can't rejuvenate any
			further. The compound he took
			is trying to force the organs and
			tissue to go further, younger,
			and they can't take the stress.
			It's like he's -- imploding. I
			can't do anything to stop it, sir.
			Can you give him something for
			the pain?
			Mark... can you hear me?
			Yes.
			I'll always love you.
			Annie with the golden hair....
			Flatterer. It's grey now.
			I only see the gold....
			Rest, Jameson. Your long night
			-- and mine -- is over.
			The hostages will be released
			immediately, Captain. I am
			prepared to be -- cooperative.
			... The hostages have been freed
			by Karnas, unharmed.
			Personal note. The body of
			Admiral Mark Jameson has been
			buried on Mordan, at the request
			of his widow and with the
			permission of Karnas. Log out.
			The quest for youth, Number One...
			so futile. Age and wisdom have
			their graces.
			I wonder if one doesn't have to
			have age and wisdom to appreciate
			that, sir.
			I hope not, Number One. It would
			be such a waste of youth.
			Mister LaForge, prepare to take us
			out of orbit. Set course for Isis
			III.
			Aye, sir. Leaving orbit.
