Captain's log, stardate 41242.4.
Our last assignment has taken us
into the remote Omicron Theta
star system, home of our android
crewmember Lieutenant Commander
Data. Although we are due...
... at our next assignment, I have
decided to increase velocity to
warp eight to visit Data's home
planet for a few hours in the
hopes of unraveling some of the
mystery of his beginnings.
Sir, we are now twenty minutes
from Omicron Theta...
... mark!
Stand by for subwarp; head for
standard orbit of Data's planet.
Wonder why Data hasn't come up
here.
He said he wanted to be alone.
Perhaps it's a bigger moment for
him than we thought.
If he needs a formal invitation,
Ensign, you do the honors.
Yes sir!
Walk!
Data... !
What are you doing?
Sneezing.
Have you got a... a "cold?"
A cold what?
It's a disease my mother says
people used to get.
Ah. But humans still sneeze for
other reasons and I cannot seem
to do it right.
How can you be practicing sneezing
when you're arriving for the first
time at your home planet? Aren't
you interested in that?
More than interested. Fascinated.
One might say agog. But I find
sneezing interesting also.
Confirming Class M reading there.
But...
... but the sensors aren't showing
any life readings. Not even
vegetation.
Strange. The cruiser that found
Data reported farmland here.
Want to take her into orbit, Data?
No thank you, sir.
Continue on into close parking
orbit.
Aye, sir.
I could say "home, sweet home,"
sir... if I understood how the
word sweet applies.
It usually refers to the memories.
But usually one's own memories,
Captain.
Do the memories you were given
include "farms?"
Affirmative, sir. Turning soil,
seeding, harvesting... but the
colony's principal interest was
science.
Data, I can't understand how you
can hold the memories of four
hundred eleven people. If that
means every experience, every day
they lived...
It does not, unfortunately. It
means only the knowledge they had
accumulated. Actually, I am quite
deficient in some basic human
information.
Sneezing, for example.
"Sneezing?"
Approaching close parking orbit,
sir.
Assemble your away party,
Commander.
This is an exciting moment for
you, Data. I'm tempted to lead
the away team down myself, except
for the fact the first officer
would object...
How would Starfleet judge me if
I didn't, sir? An entire Earth
colony did disappear down there.
You have no memory at all of what
happened to them, Data?
My final memory is of great
danger, something sudden and not
understood... then a blank as if
the colonists were gone.
Now in close parking orbit, sir.
Welcome home, Mister Data.
Recording signal now locked onto
the Enterprise, sir.
This looks like anything but
farmland.
Agreed, sir. The soil here's
completely lifeless.
This is the exact position listed
in the Tripoli log.
Do you recognize anything, Data?
The land contours are familiar,
sir. Topographically, this is
the correct area.
This once was rich farmland. I'd
guess something like twenty to
thirty years ago...
I was discovered twenty-six years
ago...
There is still plant cellulose
in the soil. No signs of decay.
Also no signs of bacteria either.
If you don't mind a wild guess,
sir, I'd say everything on this
planet could have been dead or
dying at the time Data was found.
The Tripoli log stated that all
plant life appeared brown and
"dormant." They assumed it was
normal for that season.
... whereas actually everything
was dying...
I was found twenty meters in that
direction, sir.
Data, any idea at all why you were
given the colonists' memories?
I have always felt that it was
done hurriedly, but I know little
more.
Here, sir. This is where the
cruiser's landing party found
the signal device that had led
them here.
And they found me lying there,
sir.
You were just lying out in the
open? No identity record, no
instructions... ?
Only a layer of dust.
There's much more of it now, after
twenty-six years.
What is the first thing you
remember, Data?
Opening my eyes and finding myself
looking into the eyes of the
Tripoli landing party, sir.
They believed that the signal
device sensed their presence,
and activated me.
Then this very spot was your
birthplace...
But not at all like a human birth.
Having the colonists' memories,
I knew immediately how to speak,
who I was, where I was...
You were born and became fully
knowledgeable at the same instant!
I had no idea that was unusual,
of course.
It's such a strange place to be
born.
So was a manger.
A "manger," sir?
I won't even try to explain that
one, Worf...
I understand now, sir! I've got
this figured!
It was really very cleverly done
to make this look like a natural
hollow in the terrain here.
Signs of it being constructed
hurriedly...
... as if to hide something here.
Yes, that was it, Geordi.
This has awakened a memory
remnant of how the colonists
hoped to remain hidden...
... but their fear of being
discovered led to their storing
information in me.
Yes, I thought so.
No life readings in here either,
sir.
The colony laboratory, I'd guess.
Extremely well equipped.
Does this place stir any memories,
Data?
Only vague impressions of some
of my functions being tested
here, sir...
Posted by a proud parent...
This pictures something that feels
familiar, sir. And dangerous,
although I have no idea what it
represents. And that is all...
... except for an impression that
this was a... "Doctor Soong's"
work area.
Who? You can't mean Doctor
Noonien Soong?
He was called that here...
although, his memories indicate
he traveled here under a different
name.
Doctor Noonien Soong, my friend,
just happens to have been Earth's
foremost robotics scientist!
Until he tried to make Asimov's
dream of a positronic brain come
true.
The positronic brain. He promised
it would do so much. When it
failed completely, Doctor Soong
disappeared.
Now we know he went off somewhere
to try a second time.
Geordi, Data, we'll take a close
look at this lab.
You and Lieutenant Worf
reconnoiter where the rest of
these corridors lead.
Data... it's you.
An epidermal mold, I'd guess.
Made to give your exterior the
desired finish.
Lieutenant Yar to Commander Riker.
Come in, Lieutenant.
Sir... this installation is big
enough to hold hundreds of people.
But all that's here now is empty
beds.
Thank you, Lieutenant. Complete
your record scans, then report
back here.
Sir...
Seems to be a storage area here...
How many more Datas are there?
Looks like just these two...
I mean that and the real Data.
Commander, can this be another
me? Or perhaps my brother?
I honestly don't know, Data.
He needs assembling.
"He?" Data, we don't know that
this could become "alive."
It is of great interest to me to
find out, sir. I never believed it
possible I might have a link with
some form like my own.
Understood. We'll take it back
to the ship, of course.
Captain, I have a subspace reply
to your request.
Starfleet considers it vital we
begin our ship's computer upgrade
at Starbase Armus Nine on
schedule.
Damn. Can anyone see why they've
turned down a perfectly legitimate
request to finish this
investigation here?
Sir... you asked for the kind of
computer upgrade that only the
Bynars can handle. And they're
available only at this time.
Then, get us there on schedule,
Number One.
Thank you, Wesley. I'd completely
forgotten that.
Take us out of orbit, Mister La
Forge.
Captain's log, Stardate 41242.45.
Despite having only a few hours
in which to explore Data's home
planet...
... we have discovered something
which may explain Data's
beginnings... if we can properly
assemble and communicate with what
we've found.
Signal from the captain. They
need you at the debriefing.
I've been anxious to hear the
chief engineer's opinion, Mister
Argyle. Do you believe he can
be made to function?
It appears to include all the
components in your body. Not that
we really understand your
construction either...
We'll have our top medical and
engineering specialists working
on its assembly, Mister Data.
Just... one thing. Without
disassembling you, of course, if
we should need...
... If we should need to compare
this with the way... uh, with the
way you're put together... ?
Bringing it up here was the right
thing to do, of course, Number
One.
I was just saying, Data, that if
it functions, it might answer a
lot of questions for us.
Does it appear to have all
your... ah, parts?
Completely, sir.
Will we know how to... to "turn
it on?"
All right, all right...
Legitimate questions about this
need not be asked apologetically.
You're uncomfortable about aspects
of your duplicate, Data... we're
uncomfortable, too... and none of
it for any logical reason. We
know that you're as "alive" as
any of the rest of us.
If you find it awkward to be
reminded that Data is a
"machine"... you might remember
that the rest of you are merely
a different variety of
machine... in our case,
electro-chemical in nature.
Let's begin handling this as we
would anything else.
Agreed! Love that captain!
My comments, Lieutenant, do not
require applause!
Yes, sir; sorry, sir.
Let's start with you, Data.
Well... a good starting point might
be, "Why was I given human form?"
To make it easy for humans to
relate to you. Had to be. But
your designer may have had
something else to prove also.
That human-shaped robots need not
be clumsy, limited things...
You certainly operate as well as
we do, Data...
In some ways better, sir.
Ah... yes! But the important
question now may be what happened
to the colonists.
Agreed.
One of several exhibited in the
lab, by proud parents, no doubt.
This could be simply a child's
imagination. But then, several
children made similar drawings.
Doctor Crusher to Captain. At
this point, sir, we very much need
Mister Data's help.
He's on his way, Doctor.
There, Doctor. Press your fingers
there.
It operates somewhat like a
"switch," Doctor.
And these small projections?
An android alarm clock, Doctor.
Is that amusing?
It times how long I remain
unconscious.
Are you certain about us using
these heating devices, Data?
I will feel nothing at all.
Marvelous. It should all be a
lot simpler... once we can see how
your circuitry's connected.
I'll mention it to no one. You
have my word.
If you had an off-switch
Doctor... would you not keep it
secret?
I probably would.
Yes, notice the micro-circuitry
here... and here.
Then another fibroid-like
connection here.
Let's close up.
If I've done it right, he'll
switch on in a minute.
It seemed to go well...
... thanks to a look inside Mister
Data. But there have been no
signs of consciousness, yet...
Certainly a perfect match for
Data, sir.
Do you think so, really?
I wonder which of them was made
first?
He was. But they found him
imperfect and I was made to
replace him.
You may call me Lore.
I'm also a bit troubled by it
describing you as "imperfect."
Human language gives me
difficulties too, sir.
"Imperfect" could mean I lack
abilities that he possesses.
I wonder. But the point of this
is whether you and it have
approximately the same
capabilities.
We do, sir, and your referring
to him as an "it"... suggests I
too fit into the category of a
"thing."
I see your point, Commander. My
sincere apologies.
Gladly accepted, sir. As for
Lore's abilities, his use of
syntax and grammar suggests he
was given human memories similar
to mine.
You both have about equal
physical strength and mental
ability?
I believe so, sir.
Which requires I now ask you... a
very serious question. Since the
two of you are closely related
to each other...
The answer, sir, is that my
loyalty is to you and Starfleet.
Completely.
Thank you, Commander. I was
certain of that.
And Helm control are here, with
the ship's heading given in
measurements, we call them
"degrees"...
... with three hundred-sixty of
them in a full circle this way.
... Then you say "mark"...
On the nose!
Which separates it from another
three hundred-sixty degree full
circle like this... on a right
angle to that one.
So by ordering a heading so many
degrees this way, and so many this
way, the ship can travel in any
direction. All three dimensions.
And the square of the hypotenuse
of a right triangle...
Is equal to the sum of the square
of its other two...
... its two "somethings"... which
I once heard but never understood.
All of which you can learn more
about, when the captain has
approved your being on the bridge.
Have I committed an offense?
You'll find as I have that
starships are loaded with rules
which have to be learned.
You're very clever, Wesley.
I now have duties to perform.
Correct?
Were you ever this anxious to
please, Data?
Never. I judge Lore to be
superior in that desire as well.
Because I was designed to be so
human, my brother, I enjoy pleasing
humans.
"My brother." That has a nice
sound, Data.
And you consider it important to
please humans?
It's not important?
There are many things of
importance... some more so than
others.
My quarters.
Is my brother that important?
It knows you?
It can identify any of the crew.
Just as I can identify flattery,
brother.
I used it only to please you, my
brother. Is that forbidden too?
It is best used when it reflects
genuine feelings.
Then, I used it properly with you.
Do you realize Commander Riker's
hypotenuse question tricked you
into showing your knowledge was
much greater than you were
indicating?
He didn't seem that clever. I'll
be more careful.
You tend to underestimate humans,
my brother. The way you praised
young Wesley at the Helm, for
example...
A child!
He has a child's body, but we have
found him to be much more than that.
Thank you for that information,
too.
You do care about how I perform.
I pledge to be worthy of your
teaching, my brother.
How would they describe this?
"Spartan?"
I have no need for places to sit
or sleep. Do you?
Do I appear that weak?
What information are you
requesting?
Everything available on a Doctor
Noonien Soong.
Good old "Often-Wrong Soong."
A joke, brother. Actually, he
was a genius by human standards.
But had destroyed his own
reputation by making what seemed
wild promises about his positronic
brain design... almost all of which
failed.
Promises he later proved to be
true...
Which made you and I possible.
Our beloved "father."
Will I soon have a uniform like
that, my brother?
If you get one the way I did,
Lore, it means four years at the
Academy, another three as ensign,
ten or twelve on varied space duty
in the lieutenant grades...
... A system designed to compensate
for limited human abilities.
But you, my brother, have begun
thinking as humans do. You and
I are completely different from
them. Are you truly satisfied
with the memories and knowledge
of just a few hundred human
colonists? Suppose it could
reflect thousands... or a
million... or the knowledge of
hundreds of millions of life forms
of every kind?
How?
We will discuss it in time.
And will we also discuss which
of us was constructed first?
It would be foolish to
underestimate you, my brother.
Yes, I lied when I said you were
made first. With good reason.
Doctor Soong made me perfect on
his first attempt. But he made
me so completely human that the
colonists became envious of me.
You lived with the colonists?
Until they petitioned Soong to
design a more comfortable, less
perfect android. In other words,
you, my brother.
For example, haven't you noticed
how easily I handle human speech?
I use their contractions... such
as isn't or can't. You say...
... is not or cannot.
I say tomato, you say tomahto;
I say potato, you say potahto...
A very old joke, but you also
have trouble with their humor,
too. Am I right?
Quite true. I keep trying to be
more human... and keep failing.
Do you realize, my brother, that
I can help you become more human?
And... do you realize... Lore,
that I am obligated to report all
of this to our ship's captain?
I assumed as much when I began
studying you.
May I use this to learn more of
this vessel and its customs?
Use it also to describe for the
captain the time you spent with
the colonists. Including all
you know about what happened to
them.
I promise a report with great
detail and accuracy.
Thank you, Lore. And now, I
have duties to perform, unless
you need something more.
I have more than I dreamed
possible, my brother.
Captain's log, stardate 41242.5.
We now have the full story of the
micro-engineering achievement
which produced Data... and Lore...
... and of the tragedy which
deprived humanity of the
remarkable minds behind that.
Our first clue was a child's
drawing which showed a great,
complex crystal shape...
... confirmed by Lore's report to
be an unknown kind of creature,
capable of stripping all life from
an entire world... insatiably
ravenous for the life force found
in intelligent forms like
us... which Lore explains it stored
in new crystal patterns... for
purposes which are unknown.
But how did Data escape that
thing? Or Lore?
Lore had been disassembled. He
explains it as jealousy from the
colonists. And Data wasn't yet
"alive" at that time.
Which explains why Data could be
left outside in no danger from
the creature. Whatever happened
to the colonists, he would be
found by any Starfleet team that
responded to the signal being
transmitted.
By which Doctor Soong left proof
behind that his experiment did
work.
Captain, how believable do you
find that crystal thing?
Having explored so little of just
our galaxy, I find anything
possible.
Data, are you expecting Lore to
come up here? He left your
quarters some time ago.
To go... ?
My Turbo-sensors say he went to
Deck One...
Worf?
... where he examined some
microminiature work tools, then
some...
... fine grind quadratanium... ?
Which is used in our construction.
That particular compound is no
more suspicious, sir, than a human
looking for an antiseptic or an
ointment. Nevertheless, I should
check it out.
You're watching everything he
does, Data? Is that the act of
a brother?
The act of a Starfleet officer
obeying his captain, Doctor.
Speaking strictly as security
chief, Captain... how much can you
trust Data now?
I trust him completely,
Lieutenant!
But everyone should also realize
you just asked a necessary and
legitimate security question.
Thank you for explaining that,
sir.
Lesson one in becoming more human,
my brother. You must observe all
human customs.
Champagne?
An ancient ritual, still practiced
when they celebrate events of
importance.
My brother... I toast our
discovery of each other. May it
fill our lives with new meaning.
I have some doubts about the value
of human... customs in this...my...
brother...
And let us toast also...
Brother... help me...
... also Doctor Soong who gave me
the full richness of human needs
and ambitions... a perfect match
for my mind, my body...
And let us toast also the great
Crystal Entity... with which I
learned to communicate. Before
Doctor Soong disassembled me, I
earned its gratitude by revealing
the way to the colonists.
Can you image its gratitude when
I give it the life on this
vessel... and when my cleverness
lets it safely feed upon crowded
worlds in the galaxy... ?
This is strange, sir. I show
Mister Data transmitting on a
subspace channel.
He's been doing considerable
research on Doctor Soong's
background... but let's be sure.
Wesley, can you look in on him
discreetly?
Yes sir!
... and upon arriving here you can
identify me as the machine named
"Data."
End of message.
Come in, please.
Glad you are here, Wesley. Lore
suddenly attacked me and I had
to turn him off.
Why did he do that, Data?
He discovered we have been
using sensors to follow what
he does.
I practiced his facial "tic."
Do I have it right?
I'd suggest you forget imitating
him...
... because if you had said "We've
been using the sensors," instead
if "we have," I might have
suspected you were Lore.
Yes. I do use language more
formally than Lore. Please
inform the captain I will come
up to the bridge...
... and report on this.
Aye, sir.
You're certain he said he'll be
right up?
He indicated that, sir.
Sensors show Data just now
entering a turbolift, sir.
Wes, tell me again how Data said
he immobilized Lore.
He said he "turned him off," Mom...
... uh, Doctor.
Question, Mister Data... did you
or did you not swear me to secrecy
about your "off switch?"
A change of mind, Doctor. If I
cannot trust the bridge crew, whom
can I... ?
Sir! I'm picking up a "bogey"
coming in on a five o'clock
tangent.
Confirm! And so fast it makes
our warp eight look like we're
standing still!
It's transmitting no ID signal,
Captain...
Set Main Viewer on that tangent.
Shields up; go to Yellow Alert!
Transmit friendly greetings, all
languages, all frequencies.
I can't believe anything
overtaking us this fast.
Beautiful, isn't it?
I recognize it, Captain... it's
similar to that child's drawing...
My God, it's big!
Still no ID transmitted, sir.
Also, no answer to our inquiries.
Did you have a direct look at it?
It's like a snowflake crystal,
sir. But much more complex... the
entire electromagnetic spectrum
seems to play about inside it...
I haven't the slightest idea what
it is, sir.
Data, anything else Lore can tell
us about it may be important.
Can you control Lore enough to
question him?
I'll have to examine him to know,
sir.
Captain, recommend you do not
let...
... him move around the ship alone.
Ensign... !
Wesley is only trying to show
himself alert and responsible,
sir.
Something to encourage. Come,
you can watch everything I do.
Not if I have a choice.
That is quite enough, Ensign!
When addressing a senior
officer...
I've guided his training; I'm the
one at fault, sir.
You will show proper courtesy,
and I'm taking you down there to
make certain of it!
With your approval, of course,
sir.
Careful of Lore...
Good, he is still unconscious.
The captain refused to listen to
you but you were right... Lore
can be extremely dangerous.
Notice? The same twitch, even
when he's unconscious... I suspect
that...
... something went seriously wrong
during Lore's construction.
Stay back. We could have a
problem if he senses someone else
is near.
Lore, I have some questions to
ask you...
Lore, it is Data. I have a few
easy questions for you...
He senses you!
I'm sorry, I can't control him
if you stay.
Please! I'll record anything he
says!
And bring it to the bridge.
Immediately!
And you want to be as stupid as
them... ?
... dear brother!
Well, Number One?
Sir, it's Lore... with the same
facial twitch we've all seen...
lying unconscious exactly as Data
described. But he became violent,
apparently sensing that Wesley
and I were present...
Or is it Lore pretending to be
Data, and faking it all?
I asked for Commander Riker's
report, "Acting Ensign" Crusher.
And since it is now clear you are
unable to function here within
the limits of that appointment...
Captain!
Deflector shields holding, sir.
Bring photon torpedoes to ready;
main phasers to ready...
Go to Red Alert, please.
Weapons now ready, sir!
No, Captain, let me talk to it...
Why didn't you say you could?
Affirmative! Talk to it!
Open hailing frequencies!
Crystal Form, I identify myself
as "Data," advising you to stop
your attack. The humans here are
powerful, capable of injuring or
even destroying you. They can
be changed only in other ways.
Now I call that communicating.
But he mentioned "changing us,"
Captain. What does that mean?
It has many meanings, as any human
language dictionary could inform
you.
Suggest moving fast to confirm
what I told it, sir. Permission
to use the large transporter in
Cargo Room Three? There I can
beam out some living pattern,
perhaps a large tree...
Which you'll beam over next to
the entity...
You are correct, Riker.
Our ship's phasers will then blast
and disintegrate it... proving
we're dangerous.
Make it so!
Sir?
Do it!
Sir, I know this may finish me
as an acting ensign, but...
Shut up, Wesley.
Lieutenant Yar, pick a good
security team, let me know what
he does.
"Shut up, Wesley?"
Stay out of this, Madam...
Since I am finished here, Captain,
may I point out... ?
Shut up, Wesley!
... that what I've said would have
been listened to if it came from
an adult officer. Request
permission to return to my
quarters, sir.
Granted, if you take your mother
with you.
You're putting me off the bridge?
I'm asking that you keep an eye
on your son during this, Doctor.
Please, Mom. Let's go.
Emergency close!
Now show me your warrior
fierceness.
I'll look, but I should never
have let you talk me into this...
It's Data, Mom. He's been hurt!
It's Data! For once will you
trust me about something?
You must know how much Starfleet
means to me. But I'm finished
unless you can help me.
I heard you know how to turn them
on. Please?
No, this is very serious...
I know, Mom. So tell me again
to "shut up, Wesley," and I will.
You're being very unfair,
Wesley...
Data, the Crystal Thing is outside
close to the ship... and Lore is
loose somewhere inside.
How badly are you hurt... Data?
I will function sufficiently to
stop Lore, Doctor...
Whatever happens, it is important
that you two stay away from him.
Do not try to help me.
Good, you understand perfectly
so far. Next, I'll signal I'm
about to transport something
out...
... at which time the deflector
shields will turn off for a
moment, and if you move in at
that time...
How sad, dear brother. You have
made me wish I were an only child.
Then why this marvelous gift, my
brother? The troublesome little
man-child.
Are you prepared for the kind of
death you've earned, little man?
If you take one step toward my
son...
Ah, motherhood!
Back off or I'll turn your little
man into a torch!
I promise him exquisite pain
unless you obey me too, dear
brother.
Move away, Data, please!
Do you see now the advantages of
being completely human?
It includes kindness. I give you
your life, Doctor. Go, quickly
and I may not injure your son at
all.
I will stay with Wesley, Doctor.
Go! Or he'll be shrieking on the
count of five. One... two...
I'll bring help, Wesley.
Thank you for my human quality,
Doctor Soong.
Now a small payment for your son's
misdeeds.
Mom!
Stay back, Wesley! Help me some
other way!
Wesley... now!
Lore's gone, sir, permanently!
Now that your son's safe, Doctor,
report immediately to Sickbay.
Captain... The crystal thing has
begun to move away.
Data, get rid of that damned
twitch! And put on a correct
uniform.
Yes, Captain.
And Ensign Crusher...
... are you able to return to duty
now?
Yes, sir!
Then do so! Let the bridge know
all is well down here.
It's gone, sir. Without Lore, it
had no way to reach us.
And we're overdue for our computer
refit.
Number One, have you ever
considered whether Data is more
human, or less human than we want?
I only wish we were as well
balanced, sir.
Agreed!
