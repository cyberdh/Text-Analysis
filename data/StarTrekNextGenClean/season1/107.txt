			Captain's log, stardate 41194.6.
			We are in pursuit of a starship
			of Ferengi design. Our mission
			is...
			... to intercept and recover a T-9
			energy converter which the Ferengi
			stole from an unmanned monitor
			post on Gamma Tauri IV -- a theft
			which automatic scanners recorded,
			providing us...
			... with the long awaited
			opportunity to make close contact
			with a Ferengi vessel. If we
			succeed in this chase, it
			will be Starfleet's first look
			at a life form... which discounting
			rumor, we know almost nothing
			about.
			There she is!
			Enlarge.
			What is their course?
			They are now angling through that
			solar system, Captain.
			Identify.
			Listed as Delphi Ardu, sir.
			Eleven planets, unexplored.
			Stay with them, LaForge.
			Sensors read a power surge on
			their last maneuver, Captain.
			They are dropping to sub-warp
			speed... !
			Reduce to impulse power... !
			Sensor fluctuations in the energy
			readings from it, Captain.
			Possibility: a malfunction in
			their engines, sir.
			Breaks my heart.
			In visual range, Captain.
			Fully enlarge!
			Hello, stranger!
			Very impressive design.
			Anything on that design, Data?
			Nothing specific, sir. As you
			know, Ferengi technology is
			estimated to be generally equal
			to our own...
			Which does not mean identical,
			however...
			Correct, sir. We are no doubt
			advanced in some areas, they in
			others...
			They show another power surge,
			sir.
			They are firing on us!
			Damage report!
			Shields holding!
			Mostly electromagnetic, sir.
			Fusion generator and batteries
			down by...
			Our impulse engines are surging!
			They're firing again.
			Deflector shield power weakening,
			Captain.
			Phasers ready, sir. Photon
			torpedoes ready...
			Shall we return their fire,
			sir... ?
			Negative, Number One. They are
			reacting to close pursuit.
			Fall back a bit but stay with
			them.
			They are slowing too, sir.
			They may be turning to fight!
			Open hailing freq...
			Why are we gaining on them? Don't
			anticipate...
			I'm not, sir! Something's wrong...
			Sir, something is dragging us
			forward.
			Yes, I read it, too. Lieutenant
			Yar, what do your sensors show?
			Not certain, sir. I'm getting very
			confusing readings.
			Captain, this shouldn't be. Our
			ship's power systems are failing!
			Deflector shields failing, phasers
			going inoperative, sir...
			Something is completely
			immobilizing us, Captain!
			Immobilized by the damn Ferengi?!
			I need more information! Identify
			what they are using!
			Obviously we've underestimated
			their technology, Captain...
			Considerably. It appears the
			Ferengi have us right where they
			want us -- in their sights.
			Are we searching all frequencies?
			Any sign of any kind of message?
			Negative, sir.
			Weapon report, Lieutenant Worf.
			I have phasers and torpedoes
			armed, but I show insufficient
			power to fire them.
			Engineering, give me status on
			power recovery.
			Engineering, come in.
			Why aren't they answering?
			Go below, Lieutenant. Get me a
			full report from Engineering.
			Aye, sir.
			It seems impossible they could
			be draining all power from all
			systems.
			Counselor?
			I'm sensing nothing from them
			Captain. Which could mean they
			can shield their thoughts and
			emotions from others.
			Which still makes it our move.
			Sir, they may know as little about
			us as we do about them.
			Except that they know they've got
			us in deep trouble.
			If so, the question becomes how
			will they use that knowledge?
			Is there any hard information on
			them in any file, Data?
			None, sir. Only hearsay and
			thirdhand reports, most of which
			conflict.
			Which rumors do not conflict?
			That the Ferengi are... well, the
			best description may be "traders."
			What kind of "traders"?
			A more accurate comparison modern
			scholars have drawn from Earth
			history cites the ocean-going
			"Yankee Traders" of eighteenth
			and nineteenth century America,
			sir.
			From the history of my forebears?
			"Yankee Traders?"
			Who sail, in this case the
			galaxy, in search of mercantile
			and territorial opportunity.
			And are those scholars saying
			the Ferengi may not be too
			different from us?
			Hardly, sir. I believe this
			analogy refers to the nefarious
			capitalist manner in which the
			Ferengi are known to conduct their
			affairs of commerce.
			"Never give a sucker an even
			break."
			And what does that mean, Data?
			I'm not sure, sir. That entry was
			only identified as "slang", terms
			or expressions which typify
			everyday language of...
			I know what slang is, Data. I just
			haven't heard of that particular
			saying.
			But "Yankee Traders"...
			I like the sound of that. Has a
			nice historical ring to it.
			Engineering?
			Join LaForge "down below", Number
			One. Without our warp capacity,
			we're just one big floating
			target.
			Aye, sir.
			What other pertinent meaning do
			you draw from this analogy,
			"Yankee Traders?"
			Well, I doubt if they wear red,
			white and blue, sir. Or look
			anything like Uncle Sam.
			Uncle who?
			What have bright, primal colors
			got to do with it?
			Yes, I understand the allusion.
			Colors that once identified
			nations during the time when they
			competed against each other. Red,
			white and blue for the United
			States...
			Whereas the French oddly used the
			same colors in the order of blue,
			white, and red...
			... and the German nation black,
			red and gold; the Italians green,
			white and red; the British...
			Enough, Data!
			Sir, it was you who...
			We're discussing the Ferengi,
			Data!
			Mon Dieu, I wish I knew what they
			will do next...
			Given what is occurring to our
			vessel, Captain, their weapons
			could be vastly superior to ours.
			Yes, Data. That seems a
			reasonable assumption.
			Engineering?!
			Bottom line, LaForge.
			Not good, sir. The Ferengi
			forcefield that holds this ship
			compensates...
			Almost as fast as we increase
			power.
			Almost?
			There's a point-three-hundred,
			seventy-two millisecond delay
			between use of our power and the
			neutralizing counter-force of the
			Ferengi...
			We push and they push back in
			equal force, sir.
			And what is our acceleration delay
			between slow-reverse impulse and
			top warp speed?
			Point-three-hundred millisecond.
			I know what you're thinking. Shift
			down and then blow hard into warp
			nine, yes? Come back fighting,
			whooey!
			Can we do it, Geordi?
			Ask me after it's done, sir.
			I want a slow reverse-power
			drop-off over five minutes...
			We'll show them what this baby
			can do, sir.
			Give me everything you've got.
			Aye, aye, sir.
			... and with a sudden, abrupt power
			surge to high warp speed, Captain,
			I believe we can break loose from
			the Ferengi forcefield.
			I wish I knew how they are doing
			this to us.
			I wonder what they're thinking
			over there.
			That's easy. They're wondering
			what we are thinking... and what
			we might do next.
			I say fight, sir. There is
			nothing shameful in falling before
			a superior enemy.
			And nothing shameful about a
			strategic retreat, either.
			All systems ready, Captain. And
			communication's restored to
			Engineering.
			Excellent, LaForge.
			Let's throw them off guard.
			Lieutenant Yar. Open hailing
			frequencies.
			Hailing frequencies open, sir.
			At least, I won't begin with
			weakness.
			Attention Ferengi starship! This
			is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
			USS Enterprise. In the name of
			the United Federation of Planets,
			I demand you return the T-9 energy
			converter you removed from Gamma
			Tauri IV.
			Send in all language forms.
			All language forms, sir.
			Sometimes, Riker, the best way
			to win a fight is not to be there.
			Yes, sir. "He will triumph who
			knows when to fight and when not
			to fight."
			Glad the Academy still teaches
			the strategy of Sun Tzu...
			Let's hope that delay proves out,
			LaForge.
			Point-three-hundred milliseconds,
			sir.
			We'll blast full power into warp
			nine. Ready?
			All systems ready, Captain.
			Countdown to three. Stand by on
			phasers.
			One. Set warp to nine.
			Two. Divert shield power to main
			engines...
			Three!
			Merde.
			Shields up.
			Captain? I think you better see
			this...
			What's wrong?
			In my opinion, someone is reading
			every file, every "bit" of
			information stored in the
			Enterprise memory banks...
			They can do that?
			And more, perhaps.
			Doctor Crusher to the bridge.
			Conference evaluation.
			If I may recommend something,
			Captain, with our attention on
			the Ferengi vessel, we have
			ignored the planet.
			Consult the charts on this
			planet, Data. See what we have
			on it in the library.
			No response on hailing
			frequencies?
			We had no response.
			So, while we still have some power
			left, it is time for difficult
			decisions.
			While we cannot have a democracy
			aboard, I value your considered
			opinions.
			I say put all available power into
			a full-out combined phaser and
			photon torpedo salvo. Destroy
			their ability to sustain this
			forcefield, sir.
			Yes! Hit them hard and hit them
			fast.
			Impractical and provocative.
			Assuming even that we have the
			power to support that tactic.
			But Captain, firing on us was not
			an act of war?
			The facts are that the Ferengi
			did fire at us, but we were
			chasing them. Since then, they've
			only searched our computers,
			trying to learn who and what we
			are.
			Your point, Counselor?
			Let's talk to them.
			That has been tried; no response.
			But did we tell them anything they
			wanted to hear?
			Any other observations?
			Thank you all for your advice and
			counsel. Now if you will excuse
			me, I'd like to be left alone with
			Commander Riker.
			As my first officer, I assume you
			fully realize our situation.
			Although the final decision must
			be mine, this is your opportunity
			to speak your mind.
			I believe we have covered all
			available alternatives, Captain,
			but...
			Are there any other options you
			wish to analyze?
			The only one left needs no
			conversation, Number One. And it
			is the only one we must avoid.
			Sir?
			Total annihilation.
			Open hailing frequencies.
			Open, Captain.
			Attention, Ferengi starship! This
			is Captain Picard. It is obvious
			we have a situation here that
			needs resolving... And we are
			willing to do whatever is
			reasonable and necessary. I would
			like... I would appreciate...
			your presenting your terms to us.
			Captain's log, stardate 41194.8. It
			is with a heavy heart that I have
			offered to meet...
			... whatever reasonable and
			necessary terms are demanded by
			the Ferengi. I fear for my people
			and my vessel in the event the
			unknown Ferengi ask the
			unreasonable. How...
			... can I oppose even unreasonable
			demands?
			It's moving, sir.
			We ask to surrender and now they
			fire on us?
			Ready torpedoes, sir? There's
			enough power for a couple of them.
			Ready. But hold at ready,
			Lieutenant.
			Open hailing frequencies.
			Hailing frequencies open, sir.
			Ferengi vessel, we are awaiting
			your response.
			Suggest first strike, sir. Our
			shields now only have sixty-three
			seconds of power available before
			lowering.
			If the Ferengi ship's sensors can
			read us, sir, they will be waiting
			until we are most vulnerable...
			Captain, I'm afraid I agree.
			Since they haven't bothered to
			answer us...
			I'll wait a bit more, Number One.
			Fifty seconds...
			Patience. Patience...
			The quicker we can come to terms,
			the better, NCC 1701-D.
			Who is speaking?
			I am Taar. DaiMon of the Ferengi.
			You wished to discuss surrender,
			Captain Picard?
			What I actually said, DaiMon,
			is...
			UNCONDITIONAL...
			... Surrender, I warn you, is...
			Totally unacceptable!!
			We will die to the last one of
			us before such dishonor!
			Hailing frequency off, sir.
			Something has seized their ship
			too. They're in the same predicament
			as us.
			Launch a sensor probe. Set it
			to search for the source of this
			"something" that's holding us both.
			Back to hailing fequencies, fast.
			... and so I regret DaiMon Taar
			that I can no longer negotiate
			unless it is conducted visually.
			Your complete message not
			received, Enterprise. But visual
			communication is against our
			custom.
			And it is against Starfleet orders
			to accept a surrender otherwise.
			Do you withdraw your surrender
			offer?
			You give us no choice, Enterprise.
			May we have a visual on you too?
			Agreed, DaiMon Taar. You should
			be able to view us now.
			Do you have us on your screen?
			We... are now viewing you.
			I do not know how your twisted
			alien culture has paralyzed our
			vessel but I concede your
			'Enterprise' is superior.
			We will return your worthless T-9
			device and we offer the life of
			our second officers as required
			by the Ferengi code.
			I am relieved we have no such code
			involving our second officers.
			Is this to your satisfaction,
			Picard Captain?
			Your offer may be inadequate, but
			I will discuss it with my staff.
			Stand by for further communications.
			Matthews! Pola! You know this
			area is off-limits.
			Boys will be boys, Captain.
			Have you launched the probe?
			Yes, sir. We'll get readings
			soon.
			If we're not holding the Ferengi
			and they're not holding us... then
			who the hell is?
			Next, you wanted to show us
			something?
			As requested, Captain,
			library-computer information on
			this planet.
			It has been charted only, from
			long range scans. It is Class
			M, but with no indications of life
			forms, sentient or otherwise.
			However, you may find this of
			interest...
			Resolving it into our language...
			A space federation of some sort.
			But I've never heard the word
			"Tkon."
			Understandable. It has been
			extinct six hundred thousand
			of... of our years.
			According to... legend, these
			planets... were outposts... of that
			empire...
			Data. What are you doing?
			Apologies, Captain. I seem to have
			reached an odd functional impass.
			I am, ah...
			Stuck.
			Then get unstuck and continue your
			briefing.
			Yes, sir. That is what I am trying
			to do...
			But the solution eludes me.
			My hero.
			Continue, Commander. Now!
			Intriguing.
			Again, only legend, but it
			describes the Empire as impossibly
			huge and powerful.
			Surrounded by stars whose planets
			formed its defensive system?
			Correct, sir. Outposts. And the
			planet below was possibly one of
			them...
			Excuse the interruption, Captain,
			but this may be worth it. We're
			now receiving a signal from the
			probe.
			We'll take it here, please.
			Incredible!
			That's our mysterious "something,"
			Captain. It is a forcefield of
			some kind...
			Reaching up from the planet
			surface. What enormous power!
			How does the legend describe the
			end of the Tkon Empire?
			By their Sun going supernova, sir.
			Could this planet have escaped
			that?
			This planet, Gamma Tauri IV,
			could have been the most distant
			outpost, sir, in theory. But
			since it shows no life form readings...
			We'll have to look it over, Number
			One. Stand by with an away team.
			And if the Ferengi also realize
			the forcefield emanates from the
			planet, sir?
			That's a complication. We may
			have to ask them to join us in
			this.
			Team up with the Ferengi, sir?
			We were ordered to learn what we
			can about them. Do you know of
			a better way than that?
			Captain's log, supplemental. In
			orbit of the mysterious planet
			Gamma Tauri IV in the Delphi Ardu
			star system, whose unexplained
			forcefield has seized us with a
			power almost beyond imagination.
			If...
			... there is a solution to this,
			it almost certainly will involve
			cooperation from the Ferengi...
			a life form which seems as unknown
			and mysterious as the planet we
			orbit.
			Ship's power drain is critical,
			Captain. I must now shut down
			our shields to maintain life
			support systems.
			Understood, Lieutenant. Open
			hailing frequencies.
			Hailing frequencies open, sir.
			Ferengi vessel from Enterprise,
			this is Captain Picard. Come in.
			Your alien images again shock us.
			DaiMon Tarr, regarding your
			surrender to us, the facts are
			somewhat different...
			Our own probe has already shown
			us your trickery, hu-man.
			We withdraw our surrender.
			Agreed, DaiMon. May this may be
			a far more productive
			relationship.
			I prefer a profitable one, hu-man.
			"Yankee Traders."
			Explain. What means this
			"yangeetraters"?
			He heard that?
			It... acknowledges your interest
			in profit, DaiMon Taar. Is that
			an incorrect assumption?
			We seek only what is equitable.
			What do you seek? Why did you
			begin by attacking us?
			We did not attack. We gave chase
			in order to recover a
			Federation-owned energy device
			which...
			... which we know is ours. Your
			barbarous Federation chose to
			place it on one of our planets!
			On the contrary, Gamma Tauri IV
			is recognized by all civilized
			members of...
			The Ferengi are not uncivilized,
			hu-man! Is that what you
			suggest?!
			All I am trying to say is you have
			taken a device clearly not your
			own from...
			Are you now calling us thieves?!
			Certainly not. And I have no wish
			to argue issues of territory or
			property, when our mutual problem
			remains. Like it or not...
			We are both trapped by the power
			draining forcefield of this
			planet.
			On that matter, there can be no
			argument.
			Might I propose a swap?
			And... what is a "szwop"?
			An exchange, a trade...
			Yes, trade, hu-man. What is your
			offer?
			We will give you what we know
			about the planet, and in trade,
			you will give us your information.
			Ridiculous. How will we know you
			have not cheated us?
			We must trust each other, Taar.
			Amusing, hu-man. But impractical.
			Then may I propose we both
			cooperate in a joint examination
			of the planet surface?
			And what profit is in this, Picard
			Captain?
			The profit, DaiMon Tarr, lies in
			saving all our lives.
			We will agree to this. But I warn
			you now, any further trickery on
			your part will be met with no
			mercy. Understood?
			Understood.
			If you care to join us, we have
			a well-proven transporter
			device which...
			We have a matter-energy device
			of our own. We will beam a
			science team of three to whatever
			coordinates you propose.
			Excellent. We will transmit that
			information shortly. Enterprise
			out.
			Hailing frequencies off.
			I'll log that as "promising," at
			least.
			I wonder, Captain. Ordinarily,
			I don't believe in distrust at
			first sight... but this may be
			an exception.
			Especially in view of the fact
			the image he transmitted was
			likely distorted somehow, sir.
			I felt the same thing, Captain.
			He was hiding something.
			With this power drain I see no
			reason to delay, sir.
			I'd like some additional help
			on this. Can you spare Worf?
			Take him. And be careful, Number
			One.
			With this power drain, we may have
			trouble communicating with you,
			sir.
			Understood. Anything else?
			Due to this forcefield, there is
			presently no way... to beam you
			back, sir.
			You had to ask.
			Understood.
			Energize!
			Tasha? Data? Geordi? Worf?!
			Anybody?!
			Very intriguing, sir.
			What are you doing up there?
			I assume a problem of program
			coordinates due to the energy
			field around the ship, sir.
			Are we alone?
			Unfortunately.
			What do you make of these?
			Crystalline, quite inert.
			"Nothing to write home about."
			Excuse me?
			That is slang, sir.
			I did use it correctly, did I not?
			Let's find the others...
			... they can't be too far.
			Actually, the forces responsible
			for this effect would create a
			random...
			... transporter distribution
			inversely proportional to the
			density of...
			Who's that?
			What?
			That!
			Geordi!
			Geordi?! Are you conscious?
			Do I look conscious?
			No. What are you doing?
			Trying to relax, sir. My foot's
			caught...
			Up there. I materialized upside
			down about ten meters above the
			surface.
			Tricorder is useless here, sir.
			Communications are gone, too.
			It is fortunate you did not break
			anyth...
			Who's that?!
			Who are you?
			Captain's log, supplemental. It
			is now six hours since our away
			team beamed down to the planet
			surface. On the Enterprise...
			... our condition is rapidly
			worsening. Ordinarily, with
			reserve power alone, we could
			maintain life support for several
			months. But the force holding
			us...
			... has closed down all engines
			and is draining our reserve power
			too... Equally impossible, our
			oxygen level is also dropping.
			It's getting much...
			... much colder, sir.
			How far down is it likely to go?
			A lot. Even in orbital space it
			gets past minus two hundred
			degrees.
			We won't have to worry past...
			... minus seventy or so.
			Feels like that right now.
			If he moves, kill him.
			Letek, has what we've done broken
			our agreement with their captain?
			We will accuse the hu-mans of
			preparing to ambush us. It will
			be our word against theirs and
			who is more trustworthy, Mordoc?
			Hmmm. Looks like gold...
			... tastes like gold.
			It is gold!
			Accursed planet! What
			pandemonium!
			Nothing compared to what my
			captain will do...
			... when he learns you've broken
			our landing party agreement.
			What part of the agreement?
			You appeared and attacked us.
			Are you one of their assassins?
			I am Commander Riker, first
			officer of the USS Enterprise.
			Stop now unless you want our
			vessel to retaliate...
			I've got this one!
			Careful, Commander, they're much
			stronger than...
			PYGMY CRETINS... !
			Kill them.
			Hideous monsters!
			NOOO-O-O!!
			That's much better, now over
			there...
			Is this a female?
			A hu-man... female, Letek?
			Then it is true. You work with
			females, arm them, and force them
			to wear clothing?
			How sickening.
			I should visit... the family
			decks...again...
			I've diverted... all reserve...
			power there. They'll... last
			longest.
			Is there anything else we can do,
			Doctor?
			Where is... your son Wesley?
			I gave him... something. He'll
			have a... terrible headache if we
			live.
			You shouldn't have.
			Shouldn't have?
			He's my son. I love him...
			He has the... right to meet...
			death awake.
			That is... a male perspective!
			What?
			What did you say, Jean-Luc?
			I said... rubbish!
			Stop! Hold it right there!
			Set for stun!
			Already set.
			What is going on?!
			What is this?!
			How intriguing.
			I believe we can deduce these
			crystalline tree-shapes to be
			energy collectors.
			Along the same principle that is
			draining energy from our ships.
			But the Ferengi weapons were
			working when we arrived here...
			Which means something new has
			happened...
			Commander!
			BE YOU BARBARIANS?! SPEAK!
			WHO MEETS THE CHALLENGE?
			I'm beginning to understand
			what...
			... these "eyes" have been showing
			me. Patterns of force everywhere.
			This entire planet has been made
			into... well, a power accumulator.
			And that?
			... is the whole point of this
			place. I can "see" the planet's
			power emanating from...
			WHO WILL IT BE?
			Riker.
			YOU HAVE AWAKENED PORTAL
			SIX-THREE. DO YOU PETITION TO
			ENTER THE EMPIRE?
			Who asks the question?
			I AM THE PORTAL, GUARDIAN OF THE
			TKON EMPIRE.
			Why should we petition for entry
			to an empire that no longer
			exists?
			Biped...extraordinary.
			Why do you attempt deception?
			The empire is forever.
			Your empire fell prey to a
			supernova...
			Nonsense!
			Data. Please repeat the file...
			It is a matter of record, Portal,
			in the Age of Makto, the central
			star of the Tkon Empire
			destabilized and...
			But the Age of Makto is an eon
			in the future to come...
			In fact, there have been many ages
			which have come and passed since
			Makto...
			This is the Age of Bastu!
			I am afraid not, as by the Tkon
			use of galactic motionary startime
			charts, after Bastu, there has
			been Cimi, Xora, Makto, Ozari,
			Fendor...
			ENOUGH!
			This is absurd! That is over seven
			baktun of time! How can this be?
			You must have been asleep,
			Portal, for hundreds of
			thousands of our years...
			Deception is the way of these
			hu-mans. We Ferengi will gladly
			make a petition.
			We invite their petition.
			Excellent idea, sir.
			I can't wait to hear it...
			Speak.
			We... our petition is that we be
			allowed to... serve the Tkon
			Empire...
			... at no profit! Return control
			of our starship to us and we will
			happily destroy both the hu-man
			criminals and their vessel which
			attacked us without provocation.
			They came to loot your empire,
			but we intercepted them!
			You have attempted deceit. Next
			you cannot answer these accusations.
			Do you give yourself up for
			judgment?
			Yes. If you believe those
			accusations, you should act on
			them.
			And there is even more! We can
			prove the hu-mans are destroyers
			of legal commerce ... also that
			they selfishly withhold vital
			technology from backward worlds...
			... and necessary defensive
			weapons, too. We Ferengi are now
			challenge this hu-man madness...
			I admit we restrict advanced
			technology to all...
			You see! They are demented; their
			values are insane. You cannot
			believe the business opportunities
			they destroy...
			Proof of their barbarism -- they
			adorn themselves with gold, a
			despicable use of rare metal...
			And they shamelessly clothe their
			females...
			Inviting others to unclothe
			them... the very depth of
			perversion...
			Paws off, Ferengi.
			No female, hu-man or Ferengi, can
			order Mordoc around! Submit!
			Just try it, shorty.
			At ease, Lieutenant!
			I wouldn't mess with Lieutenant
			Yar if I were you...
			But maybe they'd like to find out
			the hard way, eh, Number One?
			Seems their style.
			Would you like to hear more?
			If you desire.
			They should add also that
			Starfleet has refused to prevent
			several civilizations from
			falling; we have sometimes let
			the violent and strong overcome
			the weak...
			They admit their crimes! Hear
			them; they admit the evil which
			they... !
			BARBARIAN!
			Yes, you show wisdom...
			BARBARIANS, ALL!
			But this one first. In the
			fashion the Empire has always
			challenged savages...
			No! For battle, come to me...
			You have a single chance for life.
			One only. What is the answer to
			my challenge?
			There is more! Self-determination
			of all peoples...
			You are being tested, Riker! WHAT
			IS THE ANSWER?
			How do you know my name?
			Ahhh. You are of immovable mind,
			Riker. One totally committed to
			facing any fate with composure...
			But what is the answer to my
			challenge?
			Fear is the true enemy, the only
			enemy.
			You are a noble being. And unlike
			these little ones who close their
			minds, your mind holds interesting
			thoughts.
			"Know your enemy and know
			yourself, and victory will always
			be yours." Why that thought? And
			who is this "Sun Tzu" you revere?
			An old Chinese philosopher from
			ancient Earth history...
			You must tell me more of this
			wisdom so much like our own.
			Gladly. First, our starship. Can
			you release it?
			It is released.
			All power is restored.
			Not a hell of a lot too soon,
			Jean...Captain.
			I admit I had my doubts as your
			ships battled each other...
			They tried to kill us!
			In overt acts of belligerance.
			Normally, I would have destroyed
			all of you and your ships, but
			something confused me.
			Which was?
			First you wanted to murder each
			other, then you were willing to
			help each other.
			What of our vessel? We knew the
			same answer...
			The truth is I gave those words
			to this hu-man.
			What of them? Shall I destroy
			them?
			Then they would learn nothing.
			Admirable conclusion. But what
			makes you think they will ever
			learn, Riker?
			Is this a test also?
			In life, one is always tested.
			I find them very much as we were
			a few hundred years ago... but
			with the technology we have now.
			They're very dangerous...
			Untrue! We seek friendship with
			you...
			But we can hardly hate what we
			once were. They may grow and
			learn...
			... And learn ways of destroying
			you.
			Our values require us to face that
			possibility. What of you? With
			your empire gone... ?
			Even without the empire, the
			uncivilized must be tested.
			I shall sleep... until needed
			again.
			What happened?
			Something to write home about.
			"Something to write home about?"
			Data, that's very human.
			The T-9 energy converter was
			beamed aboard and secured, sir.
			I commend your performance, Number
			One.
			I do have a request, sir.
			Permission to beam a box of Data's
			Chinese finger puzzles over to
			the Ferengi.
			A "thank you" for all they tried
			to do.
			Make it so.
