			Away Team reporting in, Commander.
			Lieutenant Worf standing by.
			This is Riker, report Lieutenant.
			The archeologists have identified
			the markings in these caverns.
			This planet was apparently once
			home to a race known as the
			Koinonians.
			What do we know about them, Data?
			The Koinonians were an intelligent
			culture which became embroiled
			in a war that lasted several
			generations. Our best evidence
			indicates they destroyed
			themselves.
			We have completed our survey of
			the third tunnel and will proceed
			into the ceremonial chamber.
			Affirmative. Enterprise out.
			Destroyed themselves, Data?
			According to historical records.
			This will be the first
			opportunity for a Federation
			team...
			Captain! Beam them up quickly!
			They---
			Emergency beam-up! Enterprise,
			emergency! Injuries. Away---
			Transporter Room!
			I've got them, Captain.
			Beam them straight to Sickbay.
			Doctor Crusher, incoming wounded.
			Away Team is aboard, Captain.
			One dead on arrival.
			Captain's Log: Stardate 43506.5
			The Enterprise remains in standard
			orbit while we investigate the
			tragedy which has struck the Away
			Team.
			Lieutenant Marla Aster, ship's
			archaeologist has been killed in
			what should have been a routine
			mission. Whatever the
			explanation, it will not bring
			back a valued and trusted officer.
			We had completed our investigation
			of the third tunnel. Our scans
			had indicated no weapons or traps
			of any kind. Lieutenant Aster
			was three meters behind me. An
			explosive device went off. There
			was no warning. Lieutenant Aster
			bore the full brunt of the
			detonation.
			I was in command. I bear full
			responsibility.
			Lieutenant. I have the utmost
			faith that you acted properly and
			in the best traditions of
			Starfleet.
			Let's take a look at that
			shoulder...
			Lieutenant Aster is survived by
			a son, Jeremy. Twelve years old.
			What about his father?
			He is also deceased, Captain.
			His only living relatives are an
			aunt and uncle residing on Earth.
			Where is the boy now?
			In class. I've alerted the
			teacher to expect us.
			Captain.
			I must accompany you. I commanded
			the Away Team.
			I appreciate the offer but this
			is my responsibility.
			Go to your quarters. Rest.
			You're relieved of duty for
			twenty-four hours.
			That's an order.
			Picard to Bridge.
			Yes, Captain.
			Assign Commander LaForge to lead
			another Away Team to the digsite.
			I want to know why this
			happened...
			Yes, Captain.
			I will be with Counselor Troi and
			young Jeremy Aster.
			I understand. Riker out.
			He had to do the same thing for
			me.
			Do you know Jeremy well?
			But I know what it'll be like for
			him.
			It's part of life in Starfleet,
			Wesley.
			They're very careful to prepare
			us for... anything. Still...
			I know.
			How can you ever get used to
			it... to telling them... ?
			You hope you never do.
			I sense the weight of this duty
			on you, Captain...
			I really wonder...
			Halt.
			I've always believed that carrying
			children on a starship... it's a
			questionable policy.
			Serving on a starship means
			accepting certain risks and
			dangers. But did Jeremy Aster
			make that choice?
			Death and loss are an integral
			part of life everywhere. Leaving
			the boy on Earth would not have
			protected him from that.
			No, but Earth is not likely to
			be ordered to the Neutral Zone
			to repel a Romulan attack...
			It was my command which sent his
			mother to her death. She
			understood her mission and my
			duty. Will he?
			In time. With help.
			Ensign Crusher does.
			Yes, he does. And so will Jeremy.
			Resume.
			Jeremy, the Captain needs to talk
			with you.
			I'm Jeremy, sir.
			My office is over there,
			Captain...
			Jeremy, it is my sad duty to tell
			you that your mother has died.
			How, sir?
			An explosive device at the mission
			site. She died instantly.
			I understand.
			I know your mother loved you very
			much, Jeremy.
			I've been told... you've also lost
			your father.
			Yessir. Five years ago. From
			a Rushton Infection. I'm alone
			now, sir.
			No one is alone on the starship
			Enterprise, Jeremy. No one.
			I really ought to get back to
			class... if I get behind...
			I'm sure your mom wanted you to
			do well in school. Wasn't she
			a teacher on Earth?
			She taught exo-archeology.
			Why did she sign on the
			Enterprise?
			She said she wanted to see the
			galaxy with her own eyes.
			Was she happy doing that?
			Yeah. Real happy.
			Did she ever tell you there was
			a chance this might happen
			someday?
			Yes.
			It might help if we talked about
			how you're feeling.
			You're a Betazoid. You know how
			I feel.
			When my father died we were living
			on Betazed. My mother and all
			her people are telepathic. I kept
			wanting to talk about my father,
			and they kept pulling my thoughts
			out of my head before I could say
			the words. It made me very angry.
			Why?
			I needed to say them out loud.
			I was confused about why he went
			away. Was it me -- something I
			had done. I felt that if I could
			just say the words he would
			somehow know how much I loved him
			and missed him.
			I thought you might feel the same
			way.
			She just had to do her job. I
			understand that.
			Did she talk to you about her
			mission before she left?
			She told me about the ruins.
			She always made it like a story
			book.
			Why do you keep going over to the
			terminal?
			No reason.
			It's nothing. I broke it
			yesterday.
			Was your mother angry when you
			broke it?
			Was she still angry when she left?
			Jeremy, did that broken terminal
			cause the accident?
			No.
			Did you cause the accident?
			No. I just never had a chance
			to tell her I fixed it.
			Jeremy, if your mother were here
			right now, would she forgive you?
			I want you to have some time
			alone for a little while. I'll
			come back when you're ready to
			talk again.
			How will you know?
			This time I will use my Betazoid
			sense, and I'll know.
			Excuse me. Am I intruding?
			No, sit down.
			How well did you know Lieutenant
			Aster?
			We spent some time together. Not
			very well.
			How well did you know her?
			Why do you ask?
			Well... I mean you just asked me...
			But why do you ask the question?
			I have been asked several times
			to define 'how well I knew
			Lieutenant Aster' since her death.
			And I heard you ask Wesley on the
			Bridge if he knew Jeremy well.
			Does the question of familiarity
			have some bearing on death?
			Do you remember how we all felt
			when Tasha died?
			I do not sense the same feelings
			of... absence... that I associate
			with Lieutenant Yar... although
			I cannot say precisely why...
			That's just human nature, Data.
			Human nature, sir?
			We feel a loss more intensely
			when it's a friend.
			But should not the feelings be
			just as deep regardless of who
			has died?
			Maybe they should, Data. Maybe
			if we felt the loss of any life
			as keenly as we felt the death
			of those close to us, our history
			would've been a lot less bloody.
			LaForge to Riker...
			You're back, Geordi...
			Yessir, and we've brought back
			a souvenier...
			Five more just like it... all
			identical to the one that killed
			Lieutenant Aster...
			They employ a subspace proximity
			detonator. A normal tricorder
			would never detect it.
			How long would you say they've
			been there, Data?
			It comes from the time of the
			Koinonian Wars, Captain...
			Did you find them all, Geordi?
			Yeah. But...
			Well, they were all sort of...
			left there to be found.
			Left by whom? There are no
			indications of life on this
			planet.
			I don't know, Captain... but it
			was pretty obvious that they'd
			been recently pulled out of the
			ground and defused.
			Worf!
			Counselor.
			I can understand that you don't
			want to talk about what happened.
			I have made my report to the
			Captain.
			I'm more interested in how you
			feel about what happened.
			And right now I sense great anger.
			I cannot seek revenge against
			an enemy who turned to dust
			centuries ago.
			Her death was senseless. The last
			victim of a forgotten war.
			Go on.
			There is no more to be said.
			A person has died while under your
			command. It may happen again.
			If you cannot learn to release
			the anger and the guilt, to talk
			about it...
			A leader must stand alone. As
			Captain Picard does.
			Captain Picard talks to me.
			Then may I seek your counsel about
			my plan to make the R'uustai with
			the boy...
			The Bonding.
			It is my right.
			It's a very generous offer, but
			he's not a Klingon child. He has
			different sensibilities.
			He is an orphan. I am an orphan.
			He will understand.
			Right now, there isn't much he
			can understand, Worf. He's
			holding all his feelings inside...
			Children often feel they must be
			true to the memory of a lost
			parent.
			If you offer affection to them
			too soon they can feel guilty
			returning that affection. As
			if they're betraying the love they
			feel for the parent.
			I only wish to honor his mother.
			I know. And I understand this
			means a great deal to you. But
			you must be prepared, Worf... he
			is very angry too, but his anger
			is deep inside him... When he
			finally touches it, it will strike
			out in many directions...
			including yours.
			Talk with him. Be with him. But
			do not rush this. When he is
			ready, we will know.
			Jeremy Aster, I am Lieutenant
			Worf. May I enter?
			You were in command of the Away
			Team.
			Yes. I was with Lieutenant Aster,
			your mother, when she died.
			Her death lies between us. It
			is my hope...that...someday...
			it can also bind us.
			You're a Klingon, aren't you?
			Yes.
			We studied Klingons in school.
			What do they teach you about us?
			You used to be our enemies.
			Do they teach you that every
			Klingon hopes to die in the line
			of duty as your mother did?
			In my tradition, we do not grieve
			the loss of the body... we
			celebrate the releasing of the
			spirit.
			I understand death. They teach
			us all about it.
			Jeremy Aster, we may both
			understand it, but we must bring
			meaning to your mother's death.
			Perhaps we can do it together.
			Come.
			Counselor. How is the boy?
			He is being very brave.
			Good.
			No. He'll have to get past brave.
			He is a very angry boy... He
			must learn to express that anger
			before he can really say good-bye
			to his mother.
			How can we help?
			I've asked Beverly if we might
			get Wesley to talk to Jeremy about
			his father's death...
			The one unusual element is Worf.
			Oh?
			In many ways he is suffering as
			badly as the boy. He wishes to
			involve Jeremy in a Klingon
			ceremony called the R'uustai...
			the bonding...
			I know it.
			Perhaps it would be a comfort to
			both your patients, Counselor.
			I don't think the boy would accept
			Worf right now. Later, perhaps.
			But it will have to be handled
			most delicately.
			As you always do.
			I break the unpleasant news and
			my responsibility ends. You have
			to stay with them through the
			entire grieving process.
			We find many different ways to
			deal with our pain, but over the
			years, I've discovered it is in
			our joy that the uniqueness of
			each individual is revealed. If
			I can help a person back to a
			state of joy... well, my role has
			its rewards.
			Captain, we're picking up an
			energy field on the planet's
			surface...
			Location?
			Two kilometers north of the Away
			Team's beamdown point.
			Indeed.
			Full scan.
			Inconclusive, Captain.
			Sir, I sense a... presence on the
			planet. Very vague.
			A life form?
			I can't be sure... the emotions
			of the crew are particularly
			strong right now and it's
			difficult to filter them out.
			Data, scan analysis on Main
			Viewer...
			Hi.
			Hi.
			Troi stopped by a little while
			ago. She was wondering if you
			might be willing to talk to Jeremy
			Aster at some point.
			Me? What for?
			Because of your Dad.
			What would I tell him?
			It would help him to talk with
			someone who's gone through this.
			We had each other, Wes... he
			doesn't have anyone to lean on
			now... and he might be more
			comfortable talking about it with
			someone who's not much older...
			Okay. Let me think about it.
			Okay.
			You ever think about him, Mom?
			Your father?
			Sure, I do.
			Sometimes I can't quite remember
			his face... it scares me.
			That happens to all of us, Wes...
			Sometimes I can't get his face out
			of my mind.
			Today... it's like I can see it
			all as clearly as if it were
			yesterday... the way he looked
			when he hugged me good-bye...
			Captain Picard's eyes when he
			came to tell us...
			Data, run comparison with known
			phenomena.
			The pattern has no exact match
			in Federation records.
			Is it alive?
			A possibility.
			Captain, I'm getting an unusual
			magnetic flux reading from the
			anti-matter containment pods.
			My God.
			Mom!
			All systems are functioning
			normally -- still, there's a
			fluctuation in the containment
			field. I can't account for it.
			Data, is it related in some way
			to the energy field on the planet?
			Captain...
			There is a beam of highly charged
			particles emanating from the
			planet...
			Captain, there is a presence
			aboard the Enterprise.
			An alien presence... ?
			No intruder noted by the ship's
			sensors, Captain...
			A presence...
			Security, all decks... yellow
			alert... possible intruder...
			They said you were dead.
			There was a mistake. It's okay.
			But there was an explosion... you
			were hurt.
			Jeremy, I'm not hurt. I'm fine.
			You mustn't think any more about
			it.
			The important thing is, I'll never
			leave you again.
			Oh, I see you fixed the terminal.
			Just after you. you left.
			I'm sorry I got so angry about
			that. I'm really proud of you
			-- you fixed it without even
			being asked.
			I think somebody needs a hug.
			We have to go now.
			Where?
			To the planet. That's where we're
			going to live now.
			We're not going to stay on the
			Enterprise any more?
			No.
			We're going to live in a home just
			like we used to on Earth.
			You'll see. I promise.
			Lieutenant Worf... did they tell
			you? It was a mistake.
			She didn't die. She's alive.
			Jeremy, come here...
			Lieutenant Worf, it's all right.
			I'm here for the boy.
			Lieutenant Worf to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead.
			Lieutenant Aster is in her
			quarters.
			Repeat, Worf... ?
			Lieutenant Aster. She's here.
			In her quarters. With the boy.
			Do not provoke her or interfere
			in any way until I arrive.
			Picard out.
			Have security moving that way but
			tell them to keep their distance.
			You have the Bridge. Counselor...
			There's nothing to worry about.
			I'm going to take care of Jeremy
			and make him happy.
			It's time to go.
			Where are you taking the child?
			To the planet.
			Come on, Jeremy.
			Worf to Picard, they're leaving
			their quarters...
			Captain, I believe we're headed
			for Transporter Room Three.
			We're on our way.
			Chief O'Brien, Jeremy and I are
			going down to the surface.
			Who are you?
			I'm Marla Aster...
			It's my mother, Captain... She's
			alive.
			What do you want?
			To take my child down to the
			planet.
			I cannot permit that. This child
			is my responsibility.
			I'm here to care for him. He
			needs me. Why do you resist?
			Because I don't know who -- or
			what -- you are.
			Can't you see who she is?
			Jeremy, she appears to be your
			mother, but she is not.
			What do you mean?
			You're confusing the boy...
			Wait...
			No...stop...
			Mon...Mom...
			Jeremy...
			NO...
			What did you do to her?
			Jeremy, I don't know what that
			was, but it was not your mother.
			You saw her... She was here...
			Your mother is dead.
			I touched her. She was real.
			Why would your real mother want
			you to go to the planet. There's
			nothing there but rocks and
			dust...
			It's my house. My house on Earth.
			Exactly the way it was... remember,
			Jeremy?
			But how did you do it?
			Does it matter?
			Yes. It matters.
			I am trying to understand your
			resistance. You spoke of rocks
			and dust on the planet? I decided
			to show what awaits us there.
			Why would you create this fantasy?
			It's his home.
			And it makes you happy, doesn't
			it?
			But it's not real.
			Isn't it? Jeremy, isn't that
			really Patches?
			He knows me. It's him.
			Look -- your blanket...
			It's real. It's all real.
			Jeremy, it's not. Could your
			real mother make all this appear?
			You must not stay here.
			Come with me.
			I can't.
			Is the boy in any danger?
			I don't think so. She seems to
			want to help Jeremy.
			Help him?
			Troi, would it be wise to remove
			Jeremy from his quarters?
			He does not want to leave. I
			would not recommend taking him
			by force.
			She offers him everything. All
			we offer is the cold reality of
			his mother's death.
			What would you choose? If someone
			came along and offered to give
			you back your mother...
			... your father...
			... your... husband... would any
			of us say no so easily?
			Remain in the cabin with them,
			Counselor. We're going to try
			to put an end to this from here...
			Understood.
			Mister Data, can we determine for
			certain the energy source from
			the planet is powering this
			creation?
			The beam from the planet is
			clearly tapping into the ship's
			anti-matter, Captain...
			I'd say it's running the
			manifestation off our own energy.
			So there are limits to her
			power...
			That's why she needs the
			Transporter to get the boy off
			the ship.
			So how do we cut the puppet's
			strings?
			By increasing the shield harmonics
			to match our antimatter
			containment fields, it is almost
			certain that the beam would be
			severed.
			Proceed.
			Troi, stand by...
			Jeremy, it's time for this to
			end... You know it's not real
			and it is over now...
			I'm not going to leave you,
			Jeremy. Ever again.
			Jeremy, I won't lie to you or
			trick you.
			Jeremy we'll be happy together
			as soon as...
			No...
			Anti-matter containment pods
			reading nominal...
			The shields have severed the beam.
			Captain, the energy field...
			Mister Crusher, take us out of...
			Alien intruder. Transporter Room
			Three. Security alert. Alien...
			Security to Transporter Room
			Three...
			Lieutenant Worf, Commander La
			Forge with me... Number One you
			have the Bridge.
			Come, Jeremy, we will not let them
			separate us again. We are going
			home.
			Captain, the image is back --
			she's trying to take Jeremy off
			the ship again.
			Acknowledged.
			Engineering, this is LaForge.
			Shut down power to all
			Transporters. I'm on my way...
			Lieutenant Worf, to Transporter
			Room Three.
			Bridge, seal off deck eight,
			corridors A and B.
			Engaging force fields, Captain.
			Transporters are down.
			Energy force has left Transporter
			Room Three... security alert, all
			decks...
			LaForge, the intruder may try
			to reinstate Transporter power.
			Understood, Commander...
			Bridge, release security
			forcefield eight - B.
			How are you, Jeremy? Are you
			frightened?
			-- no.
			A little, sir.
			Of course. These are frightening
			things that are happening. We
			won't let anyone harm you.
			Counselor, why don't you take the
			child to my quarters.
			No.
			It's looking over everything,
			Commander... going to school...
			Let's hope it doesn't blow us
			to Kingdom Come while it's
			figuring out how to blow us to
			Kingdom Come.
			Power's back in Transporter Room
			Three...
			By-passing to manual override...
			shutting it down...
			Transporter is down again.
			Keep it down, Geordi... for as
			long as you can...
			It is only a matter of time,
			Captain, before we can power the
			Transporters ourselves...
			We? For whom else do you speak?
			The accident on the surface was
			caused by a remnant of an old and
			tragic era. Two species once
			shared this world... one of
			energy... and one of matter. The
			physical beings you call the
			Koinonians destroyed themselves
			in unending, bitter wars. The
			surviving lifeforms on this world
			will not tolerate any further
			suffering from that dishonorable
			past. So they have made this
			possible... they have made me
			possible.
			I appreciate your motives. But
			his mother is dead. He must learn
			to live with that.
			I will be every bit his mother.
			But not his mother.
			Picard to Lieutenant Worf.
			Go ahead, Captain.
			Please escort Ensign Crusher to
			the Aster quarters. Picard out.
			Your philosophy is curious,
			Captain. What is so noble about
			sorrow? I can provide him an
			existance where he will feel no
			pain, no anguish...
			It is at the heart of our very
			nature... to feel pain... and
			joy... that is what makes us what
			we are.
			He is alone now in your world.
			A child alone. How can you know
			he won't be happier with me?
			For a brief moment in time... he
			surely would be. Any of us in
			his place would be.
			What would Jeremy do for friends
			in your world?
			He will have any friends he needs.
			And then will you provide for his
			education, his health, his growth?
			A career? A wife?
			Yes, it is quite an undertaking
			you're proposing, isn't it?
			It is our duty to make him happy
			again.
			Do you honestly believe he will
			be happy in this total fiction
			you wish to create?
			What will be his reason to live?
			What you offer is a memory... to
			cherish... but not to live in.
			It is part of our life cycle to
			accept the death of those we love.
			He must deal with grief, not cover
			it or hide from it. We are
			mortal. Our time in this universe
			is finite. It is the lesson every
			human must learn.
			Ensign Crusher reporting as
			ordered, sir.
			Come in, Wesley.
			... No, stay, Lieutenant.
			Wesley lost his father on a
			Starfleet mission when he was
			even younger than you are.
			Your mother told me you were
			finding it difficult to talk to
			Jeremy. Why?
			I don't know. I guess... I just
			didn't want to think about it any
			more, you know... all this has
			reminded me so much of that day...
			The day I told you your father
			had been killed.
			As I recall, you handled the news
			very well.
			My parents taught me about the
			dangers of starfleet missions.
			I knew it could happen.
			So you were prepared.
			No, I don't think I was. Not
			really. How could anyone be...
			prepared to hear that his dad
			is... never coming home again.
			I just tried to be what everybody
			expected me to be. Brave.
			Mature.
			Are you saying you didn't want
			anybody to see how you really
			felt, Wesley?
			So how did you really feel?
			Like somebody kicked me right in
			the brain.
			Somebody?
			Go ahead, Wesley. You've wanted
			to tell him for a long time...
			I was angry.
			At you.
			Why, Wesley? Why were you angry
			with me?
			Were you angry because I was the
			one who told you he was dead?
			No.
			Then why?
			Because you led the mission. You
			came back. My father didn't.
			How long were you angry with
			Captain Picard, Wesley?
			A long time.
			But not any more. Not even a
			little, sir.
			And you Jeremy... must be very
			angry with Lieutenant Worf.
			He was in charge of your mother's
			mission. Just as Captain Picard
			was in command when Wesley's father
			was killed. Isn't that right,
			Jeremy
			She was my responsibility.
			Worf came back. Your mother
			didn't.
			Why? Why weren't you the one who
			died? Why did it have to be her?
			He can't answer that, Jeremy.
			None of us can.
			Lieutenant Worf also lost his
			parents, Jeremy.
			They were killed in battle when
			I was six.
			When I was alone, humans helped
			me. Let me help you.
			The Marla Aster I knew and honored
			is not in this room. Nor does
			she await you on the planet. Now
			she lives only here...
			And here.
			Join with me in the R'uustai, the
			Bonding. You will become part
			of my family now and for all time.
			We will be brothers.
			SoS jIH batlh SoH.
			What does that mean?
			It honors the memory of our
			mothers. We have bonded and our
			families are stronger.
			SoS jIH balth SoH.
