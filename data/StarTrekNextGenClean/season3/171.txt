			Captain's log, Stardate 43917.4
			The Enterprise has been given the
			singular honor of hosting the
			first face to face meeting between
			the Federation and the mysterious
			race of beings known as the
			Legarans. We are in orbit around
			Vulcan preparing to welcome aboard
			the Federation ambassador that
			has made this historic event
			possible.
			I can remember studying his career
			in school... the treaty of Alpha
			Cygnus Nine, the Coridan admission
			to the Federation, the Klingon
			Alliance...
			I met him once... Many years ago,
			just briefly at his son's wedding.
			But I'll tell you it was quite
			a moment for a young lieutenant.
			Standing in the presence of such
			history... I was a little
			tongue-tied to be quite frank...
			You... tongue-tied?
			Indeed. After all, how does one
			make small talk with a man who
			has virtually shaped the
			Federation...
			Is it true that he'll be
			retiring after this mission?
			Unofficially, that's what I hear.
			And what a crowning achievement
			this will be to his career. The
			benefits of relations with the
			Legarans are incalculable.
			Ah... Captain Picard. I am Ki
			Mendrossen, the ambassador's chief
			of staff. This is Sakkath, his
			personal assistant.
			Has the ambassador been delayed?
			He will be joining us momentarily.
			But first we must discuss some
			matters of the utmost delicacy.
			By all means.
			To be frank Captain, the
			ambassador is not a young man.
			He tires easily.
			He is going to need a great deal
			of rest to prepare himself for
			the difficult job that awaits him.
			Which is why it's imperative that
			he be allowed to conserve his
			strength. I must request that
			you dispense with any official
			ceremonies you would normally
			accord a visitor of his rank.
			We had planned for a ship's
			concert this evening.
			Yes, I believe that the ambassador
			is extremely fond of Mozart.
			I'm afraid it would be impossible
			for him to attend. Upon his
			arrival he will be taken directly
			to his quarters where he will
			remain in seclusion until we reach
			Legara Four.
			You have my assurance that the
			ambassador will not be disturbed
			during our voyage.
			That's all we ask. Well, now...
			that's settled. The ambassador
			is waiting.
			Welcome aboard the Enterprise
			Ambassador Sarek.
			We come to serve.
			Your service honors us.
			Allow me to present she who is
			my wife.
			Mrs. Sarek.
			Please call me Perrin, Captain.
			This is my first officer,
			Commander Riker.
			Captain, if you'd be so kind as
			to show us to our quarters.
			I prefer to view the conference
			room first.
			Ambassador, I'm sure Sakkath and
			I can handle all the necessary
			details...
			I will examine it for myself.
			Dear, perhaps it would be best
			if we settled in first.
			They worry about my health,
			Captain. Too much.
			You will take me to the conference
			room, please.
			If you'll follow me, sir.
			Are the Legarans really going to
			sit in this stuff?
			Well, I'm sure not.
			Can you believe this smell?
			What smell?
			What can I say... to us it's a
			slime pit, to them it's home.
			The environmental controls are
			ready. What's next?
			Why? Are you in some kind of
			hurry?
			I have... sort of a date.
			With who?
			Ensign Dumont.
			That is one attractive lady. I've
			got to admit I'm surprised.
			What, that she'd go out with me?
			No, that you had the nerve to ask
			her. Way to go Wesley.
			The room is not ready.
			No Ambassador. Commander LaForge
			and Ensign Crusher are---
			The Legarans are very sensitive
			in matters of protocol. You will
			remove all furniture from the
			room. The walls must be bare.
			I'm sure that by the time the
			Legarans arrive, everything will
			be set up according to our
			specifications. Isn't that right,
			Captain?
			Ambassador, please be assured that
			everything will be ready by the
			time the conference begins.
			My husband and I have every
			confidence in you, Captain.
			I have worked for ninety-three
			years in preparation for this
			meeting. It is vital that no
			detail be overlooked.
			Perhaps we should allow these
			gentlemen to return to their work,
			Ambassador.
			That will be acceptable.
			These walls are too bright.
			So what was the ambassador like?
			The way Mendrossen described him,
			I expected him to be a frail old
			man.
			I hope I'm that frail when I'm
			two hundred and two. His aides
			did seem a little overprotective,
			didn't they?
			From what I could see, the
			ambassador doesn't need to be
			protected from anything.
			Nevertheless, we will honor Mister
			Mendrossen's request and allow
			Ambassador Sarek his privacy.
			I suppose they were foolish and
			vain, my expectations of this
			voyage. Sharing his thoughts,
			his memories, his unique
			understanding of the history he
			has made...
			Does this mean you're going to
			cancel the concert this evening?
			No, the concert will go on as
			scheduled. But it is a pity that
			the guest of honor will be absent.
			For all we know, the ambassador
			might enjoy an evening's
			entertainment...
			Why not ask his wife if she'd like
			to attend?
			I think that's an excellent idea.
			The bridge is yours, Number One.
			Come in, Captain.
			I hope I'm not intruding.
			Not at all. But I'm afraid that
			Sarek is in meditation at the
			moment.
			Actually, I came to see you.
			Why, how nice Captain. I so
			rarely get visitors of my own.
			Usually everyone wants to see the
			ambassador.
			I find that hard to believe.
			These quarters are lovely.
			The ambassador and I were both
			very pleased when we heard that
			the negotiations would take place
			aboard the flagship of the
			Federation.
			The honor is ours.
			My husband has followed your
			career with interest. He finds
			it to be satisfactory.
			High praise from a Vulcan.
			Ah, then you have had experience
			with Vulcans, Captain. Some
			people who expect an emotional
			response often find Vulcans
			quite cold when they are merely
			being...
			Logical.
			Exactly.
			I have come to extend my personal
			invitation to you... and your
			husband, if he is available, to
			attend a Mozart recital this
			evening.
			Mozart? That would be wonderful.
			Any chance that they will be
			performing the string quartet
			number six?
			I'm sure it could be arranged.
			It's a very tempting offer...
			I doubt that the ambassador will
			be able to attend, but I will make
			it a point to ask him.
			Well, then I hope to see you
			tonight.
			As do I.
			You are still unable to meditate?
			It is of no importance.
			It has eluded you for many weeks.
			I said, it is of no importance.
			You know I am right.
			My wife, you will leave me now.
			I require solitude.
			The temperature in the tank is
			now one hundred fifty degrees
			Celsius.
			Okay, lock it off.
			Is that it? Can I get out of
			here?
			What's your hurry? You don't
			really think something's gonna
			happen between you and Suzanne
			Dumont...
			At least I'm not spending the
			night with a good book like some
			people...
			What's that supposed to mean?
			Just what it sounds like.
			You'd get more action out of a
			good book than you'll ever see
			on this date, I guarantee it...
			she's not going to waste her time
			with someone like you.
			Someone like me?
			She's way out of your league.
			Since when did you become an
			expert on women?
			Compared to you, every man on this
			ship is an expert on women.
			At least I don't have to find my
			women in the Holodeck!
			What did you say?
			You heard me!
			Something wrong?
			I asked a question.
			No, sir. Nothing wrong here.
			May I be excused, Commander?
			Anything you want to talk about,
			Geordi?
			No, sir.
			I noticed that Lieutenant Worf
			put Ensign D'Amato on report...
			for insubordination.
			D'Amato's been an exemplary
			officer.
			Indeed he has. Look into it,
			Number One.
			I assume work has been progressing
			in the conference room?
			Yes, sir. I checked on Geordi
			and Wesley a few hours ago.
			For a moment there... I thought
			that the two of them were actually
			going to... hit one another.
			Ambassador Sarek, Perrin... on
			behalf of my entire crew, welcome.
			It was my wife's suggestion that
			we attend... and it seemed an
			ideal diversion. My wife can be
			quite logical when she so chooses.
			It seems the ambassador had more
			free time than I anticipated.
			This is Commander Data. He will
			be the featured soloist this
			evening.
			We will start the evening with
			Mozart's string quartet number
			six. I am programmed to reproduce
			the individual musical styles of
			over three hundred concert
			violinists, including Heifitz,
			Menuhin, Grak-tay and Tataglia.
			Do you have a preference?
			Tataglia would be lovely.
			I hope you find the performance
			pleasing.
			I look forward to it.
			At your convenience, Commander.
			Hi Mom. I got a message you
			wanted to see me?
			I thought you were going to be
			at the concert last night.
			I said I might be going. Suzanne
			wanted to go to the arboretum.
			Captain Picard asked where you
			were. I don't like having to make
			excuses for you.
			Excuses? Come on, Mom... it
			wasn't an official function.
			You have responsibilities young
			man and I expect you to live up
			to them!
			Don't you think you're
			overreacting a little?
			Don't talk back to me!
			Okay, I won't.
			Where do you think you're going?
			Away from you.
			Mom!
			... and then I just slapped him.
			Really hard.
			I slapped Wesley.
			Do you know why you did it?
			I never hit my son in his life.
			Beverly, this is important. What
			were you thinking when you hit
			Wes?
			That's just it... I wasn't
			thinking about anything. I was...
			just angry... so angry.
			And Wesley didn't provoke you in
			any way? It wasn't anything he
			said, anything he did?
			No. It was a sudden... burst of
			anger. I still can't believe I
			did it.
			I don't know why you did it either,
			Beverly. But I can tell you that
			I've heard the same kind of story
			from ten different people in the
			past two days.
			This is your Command Center.
			Yes. It is normally occupied by
			Captain Picard, Commander Riker,
			and Counselor Troi.
			Counselor Troi is Betazoid?
			Half-Betazoid. Her father was
			human.
			Then she is not a true telepath?
			Her skills are empathic in nature.
			She can sense the emotions of
			other beings.
			What is Captain Picard's
			background in diplomacy?
			Extensive. The captain's first
			diplomatic contact dates back to
			Stardate---
			And what of his knowledge of the
			Legarans? Would he be able to
			conduct negotiations with the
			Legarans should the need arise?
			Do you foresee such a circumstance
			occurring? Is Ambassador Sarek
			unable to --
			Forgive me. I was merely
			exploring various possible
			permutations of our mission.
			Your tour of the bridge has been
			most informative.
			Excuse me, we were sitting here.
			Well, we're sitting here now.
			Come on fella... this is our
			table.
			Really?
			Funny... I don't see your name
			on it.
			Didn't your mother teach you
			manners?
			Hey guys, some kind of problem
			here?
			There seems to be a question of
			who's table this is.
			There are plenty of other tables.
			I suppose you're right.
			Why don't I get everyone another
			round of drinks?
			I don't need to tell you that
			insubordination is a serious
			charge to level against any
			officer.
			I am aware of that Commander.
			However, Ensign D'Amato directly
			challenged my authority.
			Is it my imagination, or have
			tempers aboard this ship been
			getting a little frayed lately?
			I hadn't noticed.
			I see what you mean.
			Geordi, what the hell is going
			on here?
			I wish I knew.
			Security team to Ten-Forward.
			All right, that's enough!
			... and the next thing I know
			somebody's left hook is on its
			way to my chin.
			Captain, this is not an isolated
			incident. There have been reports
			of random violence all over the
			ship...
			Are you suggesting it is somehow
			contagious?
			There's no indication of a virus
			or bacteria... I've run every test
			I know... I've checked the water,
			the food replicators, airborne
			samples...
			This is one hell of a time...
			Whatever it is, I don't want it
			to affect the ambassador... I
			want his quarters isolated from
			the rest of the crew until we can
			identify the cause.
			It's not that simple, Captain.
			We've been able to determine that
			these outbreaks of violence
			started... at virtually the same
			time Sarek's party beamed aboard
			the ship.
			We do have a working theory...
			We believe it's possible that
			Ambassador Sarek himself is
			responsible for these incidents.
			Sarek?
			I felt something from him during
			the concert... it was vague and
			undefined... but very
			disturbing...
			He cried. I saw that. I didn't
			believe it. A Vulcan moved to
			tears by music... ?
			Vulcans have the same basic
			emotions that we do. But they
			have learned to repress them.
			At the concert, I was sensing
			that Sarek had lost control...
			What would cause such a loss of
			control?
			There is a very rare condition
			that sometimes affects Vulcans
			over the age of two hundred.
			Bendii Syndrome.
			The early symptoms include sudden
			bursts of emotion, mostly
			irrational anger. Eventually,
			all emotional control is lost.
			I can't imagine anything that
			would be more offensive to a
			Vulcan. Their emotional
			detachment is the very core of
			their being.
			But why would it affect others
			aboard the ship?
			Vulcans possess telepathic
			ability. Sarek could be
			unintentionally projecting these
			intense emotions onto other
			people... at random.
			And when the Legarans beam
			aboard...
			They could very well be affected
			too.
			Is there a treatment?
			Can't anyone take his place?
			Sarek has built a personal
			relationship with them. They will
			accept no one else.
			How can we confirm your
			diagnosis?
			We grow a culture from the tissue
			of the metathalamus... but the
			results will take several days.
			I have twelve hours.
			That's impossible, Captain Picard.
			I cannot delay the conference...
			not for a day, not for an hour.
			The schedule itself required three
			months of negotiations.
			Nevertheless, I believe we are
			facing a potentially far worse...
			I give you my word of honor that
			the ambassador is in perfect
			health. Is that not enough?
			Mister Mendrossen...
			You are dealing with a theory full
			of holes, Captain. Why am I not
			affected by Sarek's supposed
			condition? And Perrin, how could
			his wife function normally if this
			theory of yours is correct?
			I cannot explain that. Hundreds
			of others on board have not been
			affected either. I have not.
			The effects appear to be random.
			Proximity apparently has no
			bearing on the phenomenon.
			You are accusing the greatest man
			of his time of losing his mind.
			On the eve of his greatest
			triumph. And you cannot explain
			why... ?
			I won't report this to the
			ambassador. For the moment. I
			do not want to divert his
			attention from the mission.
			And I don't want to jeopardize
			your career unnecessarily. But
			if I were you, in the interests
			of your career, I'd be very
			concerned about finding the real
			cause of these outbursts before
			the Legarans arrive.
			Mister Data, please report to my
			Ready Room.
			Captain Picard is not satisfied
			with Ki Mendrossen's assurances
			that the ambassador is in good
			health. Do you consider Sarek
			capable of carrying out his
			mission?
			Have I given you cause to think
			otherwise?
			You have voiced certain
			reservations about his abilities
			to me.
			I do not recall making such a
			statement.
			Directly, no. However, you did
			question me on the diplomatic
			capabilities of both Captain
			Picard and Counselor Troi.
			I am honor bound to help Sarek
			carry out his mission. That is
			the only answer I can give.
			Then you must decide which is your
			greater obligation: your loyalty
			to Sarek or your duty to the
			Federation.
			Can you accept the logic of
			continuing the mission?
			Tell your captain... the mission
			is in jeopardy.
			Sakkath has been able, until very
			recently, to use his telepathic
			skills to reinforce Sarek's
			emotional control and thus protect
			others from the effects of his
			deterioration.
			He hasn't been doing a very good
			job...
			The strain of this mission on
			Sarek has made it impossible.
			Ironic isn't it? Despite our
			magnificent technology, we find
			ourselves still susceptible to
			the ravages of old age. The loss
			of dignity, the slow betrayal of
			our bodies by forces we cannot
			master.
			Still want to be one of us, Data?
			Sir, it is conceivable that even
			for me, time will eventually lead
			to a irreparable circuit failure.
			But there is one thing I do not
			understand...
			Yes... ?
			Sarek is a logical, intelligent
			being. The effects of Bendii
			Syndrome are apparent. Why would
			such a man choose to ignore
			them?
			Logic fails us sometimes, Data.
			This is one of those times. I
			can only guess that he does not
			see or does not wish to see the
			truth. And he is being insulated
			from that truth by those who love
			him the most.
			Someone has to confront him.
			It is not a task I look forward
			to.
			I don't understand this...
			everyone's protecting Sarek...
			his wife, Mendrossen, even you.
			What would you have me do... march
			down there and destroy the man?
			The mission with the Legarans
			cannot go forward with Sarek in
			this condition.
			I know --
			Then tell him that there is no---
			Don't you tell me...
			Captain... Commander...
			You're right of course, Number
			One. But I am loathe to do what
			I must do.
			I don't think I really understand
			what you're telling me, Captain.
			My husband is responsible for your
			crew assaulting one another... ?
			He is very ill, Perrin.
			Bendii Syndrome is more a folk
			tale than a disease. There hasn't
			been a true case in my husband's
			lifetime.
			There is one now. Sakkath knows.
			Sakkath? Sakkath knows nothing
			my husband didn't teach him.
			He knows. More than that, he has
			been consciously holding Sarek's
			mind together on this mission as
			well as he could...
			That is not true!
			I must see Sarek.
			Captain, I know a good deal about
			the Vulcan mind and I know a good
			deal about the heart of one
			particular Vulcan.
			I am his wife and I tell you he
			is fine. He does not have Bendii
			Syndrome. And that shall be the
			end of it.
			I'm sorry.
			Please... you must not do this to
			him.
			Must not do what, my wife?
			If Captain Picard wishes to see
			me, he may do so.
			I regret that we have seen so
			little of each other on this
			voyage, Captain.
			The loss is mine, Ambassador.
			Captain, may I talk to you in
			private --
			You were speaking of your belief
			that I suffer from Bendii
			Syndrome.
			I have been accused of many things
			in my life... but never an excess
			of emotion.
			Sarek, I see no reason to continue
			this discussion...
			On the contrary, I wish to assuage
			any fears that the captain may
			have regarding my capabilities.
			I believe there is a test for
			Bendii Syndrome, I will take it
			immediately.
			Unfortunately the results would
			not be available for several
			days... which is why I must ask
			for a postponement of the
			conference.
			That would be a mistake. Captain
			I give you my word that I am in
			perfect health.
			Then why must Sakkath help you
			contain your emotions?
			Is what the captain says true?
			No, Ambassador, absolutely not.
			Perrin were you aware of this?
			Sakkath, I await an answer.
			I have used my limited abilities
			to strengthen... your mental
			discipline.
			Your efforts will no longer be
			required.
			That would not be wise.
			It may not be wise... but it is
			necessary.
			Leave us. I wish to speak with
			Captain Picard.
			Sarek, I ask you to reconsider.
			Obey my wishes.
			There is nothing to fear.
			I hope I have not embarrassed you,
			Ambassador.
			You seem to forget I am a Vulcan,
			Captain. I am not affected by
			emotional considerations.
			I believe you are affected, sir...
			far more than you realize.
			I am a logical being. Present
			your arguments. I will listen.
			There has been an epidemic of
			violent incidents aboard the
			Enterprise. As we speak, the
			situation is worsening.
			And it is your hypothesis that
			I am the cause of these incidents?
			My chief medical officer has
			explored all other probable
			causes.
			I share your concern for your
			crew. However, you must agree
			it is not unusual for a starship
			to encounter unexplained
			phenomena.
			That is correct.
			Therefore, since I can assure you
			that I am not the cause of your
			difficulties, the logical course
			of action is for your doctor to
			continue her search.
			She is... but the fact remains
			that these incidents began shortly
			after your arrival.
			Is your entire argument to be
			based on mere coincidence?
			Is it also coincidence, that your
			wife and chief of staff have been
			carefully isolating you?
			I believe I now see the flaw in
			your logic. You are reacting to
			their overprotective attitudes
			towards me.
			They are both somewhat emotional
			regarding my... age.
			Surely Sakkath is not influenced
			by emotions.
			Am I to be branded by the
			judgment of a child? Sakkath
			is young and inexperienced. He
			erred in his assumption that I
			needed help.
			But you did need his help at the
			concert.
			Or perhaps you have a logical
			explanation for what happened
			that night?
			What... happened?
			I saw you crying.
			I did not... cry.
			I was there... I saw the tears.
			You exaggerate, Captain. I
			recall... only one tear.
			Then you were emotionally affected
			by the music.
			That is not possible.
			You still have not answered me,
			Sarek. Is it logical for a Vulcan
			to cry?
			It was late... I was fatigued.
			Nothing more.
			The Legarans trust only me. They
			will not meet with any other
			representative of the Federation.
			I must be allowed to complete my
			mission. There are no other
			logical solutions.
			No other logical solutions? But
			Ambassador, there are always other
			solutions. You have said so
			yourself many times.
			What I meant was...
			Sarek of Vulcan was never afraid
			to look straight at something he
			did not want to see.
			I warn you Captain, your efforts
			to discredit me will not succeed.
			Sarek of Vulcan never confused
			what he wanted with the truth.
			I will not be spoken to in such
			a manner.
			Is that anger I hear in your
			voice?
			It would be illogical for a Vulcan
			to show anger... it would be
			illogical... illogical...
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			In three hours time we are
			scheduled to meet with the Legaran
			delegation. However it is now
			all too evident that Ambassador
			Sarek is in no condition to
			proceed with the conference.
			We're entering the Legaran system,
			Captain. Shall I have Mister Worf
			contact their ambassador?
			No.
			I will present our regrets to the
			Legarans personally. It is vital
			that they understand our reasons
			for cancelling the negotiations.
			Captain, with all due respect...
			I think you did the right thing.
			But at what cost, Number One?
			Come.
			Perrin?
			I must speak with you, Captain.
			I'll be on the bridge, sir.
			How is the ambassador?
			Resting.
			I've come to ask you to reconsider
			your position.
			You know that's impossible.
			Sarek is a... good man, Captain.
			He has given the Federation a
			lifetime of service. I beg you,
			let him keep the respect he has
			earned.
			He will never lose that respect.
			If you need to blame someone,
			blame Mendrossen and me.
			But we never wanted to deceive
			you. My husband's... condition...
			came on him so... gradually. It
			was so easy to... delude
			ourselves, to pretend that nothing
			was wrong. We convinced ourselves
			that he could complete this one
			last task... and end his career...
			the way it began... with dignity.
			I'm not blaming anyone.
			Then help him, Captain, please.
			Help him regain his pride...
			his honor.
			Believe me, nothing would give
			me greater pleasure. But there's
			nothing I can do.
			The mission can be saved.
			But he needs your help to do it.
			A mind-meld... between the two
			of us? Do you realize the dangers
			involved in what you are
			proposing?
			Yes, Ambassador, I do. But I also
			realize the potential benefits.
			We would be telepathically
			linked... exchanging our
			thoughts... becoming in essence
			one mind.
			Which, for a few hours, should
			provide you with the emotional
			control you need. Enough time
			for you to meet with the Legarans
			and conclude the treaty.
			It is a generous offer. But I
			must warn you that while I would
			gain your stability, you would
			experience the fierce onslaught
			of emotions unleashed by my...
			condition. Vulcan emotions are
			extremely intense... we have
			learned to suppress them. No
			human would be able to control
			them. They would overwhelm you...
			the mind-meld can be a terrible
			intimacy.
			I cannot allow it.
			I am aware of the risks, Sarek.
			But I believe it is the only...
			logical solution.
			Your courage honors me, Captain.
			I can't say I approve of this,
			Jean-Luc.
			I didn't expect you would,
			Beverly.
			Is there some way I can talk you
			out of it?
			I'm afraid not. Though I do admit
			to a certain... trepidation.
			Your company is appreciated.
			Come.
			I see you are ready, Captain.
			Doctor Crusher will be monitoring
			our responses.
			A sensible precaution.
			My mind to your mind... your
			thoughts to my thoughts...
			Commander, the Legarans are ready
			to beam aboard.
			Very well...
			Number One, please inform the
			Legaran delegation that Ambassador
			Sarek is on his way to welcome
			them.
			Yes... Ambassador.
			NO!!!
			It is wrong. A lifetime of
			discipline washed away, and in
			its place... bedlam...
			Nothing but bedlam.
			And I am helpless to prevent it!
			I am old! Nothing left but dry
			bones and dead friends.
			Weary, so weary.
			It will pass. All of it.
			Another hour or so at most.
			You're doing fine... Just hold
			on.
			No! This weakness disgusts me!
			I hate it! Where is the logic?
			I am betrayed by desires... I want
			to... feel... to feel everything!
			But I am Vulcan.
			I must feel nothing. Give me back
			control...
			Jean-Luc...
			Perrin...
			Amanda... I could have given you
			so much more. I wanted to show
			you tenderness. But it is not
			our way. Spock... Amanda did you
			know... ? Perrin, can you know...
			how much I... love you?
			I do love you!
			Beverly...
			I'm here... I'm not going to
			leave you.
			It's so... difficult.
			The anguish in the man...
			despair... pouring out... so
			many... feelings... regrets...
			I can't stop them...
			Don't even try.
			First officer's log, Stardate
			43920.7. Ambassador Sarek has
			successfully concluded the
			negotiations with the Legarans.
			The USS Merrimac has arrived and
			will transport the ambassador and
			his party back to Vulcan.
			I hope your journey aboard the
			Merrimac will be uneventful.
			With the pressures of the
			conference behind him, I believe
			I can help maintain his control
			until we return to Vulcan.
			What will happen to him then?
			The effects of Bendii syndrome
			are irreversible.
			Medical research is always
			continuing, of course...
			Thank you, Captain.
			He... loves you... very much.
			I know. I've always known.
			I will take my leave of you now,
			Captain. I do not think we shall
			meet again.
			I hope you are wrong, Ambassador.
			We shall always retain the best
			part of the other inside us.
			I believe I got the best part of
			that bargain, Ambassador.
			Peace and long life, Sarek.
			Live long and prosper.
