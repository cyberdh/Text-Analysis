Captain's log, Stardate 43042.3.
We are cautiously entering the
Delta Rana star system three
days after receiving a distress
call from the Federation colony
on its ninth planet.
The garbled transmission reported
the colony under attack from an
unidentified spacecraft. Our
mission is one of rescue and --
if necessary -- confrontation with
a hostile force.
Shields up, maximum strength.
Shields up.
Sensors do not indicate the
presence of any armed space
vehicles operating in the Rana
system.
They could be cloaked or otherwise
shielded.
Mister Crusher, bring us in well
clear of the planet's three moons.
Aye, sir.
Commander, I am not receiving
Rana Four's call sign.
Open a frequency to Colony
Operations.
There is no response. Rana Four
is emissions quiet.
Captain, there are eleven thousand
inhabitants in the colony. At
this range I should be feeling
something.... I'm not.
Mister Data, put the planet
on the Main Viewer.
Magnify.
My God...
Helm, put us in a high equatorial
orbit. Scan for survivors.
Survivors? Down there?
Sensors are scanning ninety
degrees of longitude as we orbit.
I am detecting no artificial
structures, no vegetation, no
bodies of water...
Lifeform readings are negative.
Could the colonists have escaped?
That is unlikely. Rana Four
possessed no interstellar
spacecraft.
Who could cause devastation on
such a scale?
Hold it -- hold it! I'm getting
something at thirty-seven degrees
north, sixty-two degrees east --
a structure!
Life?
Two lifeforms. Possibly human.
Put the area on the Main Viewer
and magnify.
The structure is located at the
center of the vegetation.
An entire planet obliterated...
except for a few acres of trees
and grass... and one building?
It's some kind of illusion...
Negative. It is as you see it.
Number One, I think you had better
see who's home...
If they're the only survivors
of a global holocaust, they can't
be in very good shape.
Counselor... ?
What I sense of them is human...
And something else... ?
It's difficult to explain... I
feel these two people are
somehow... different.
I'm sorry. I cannot be any
clearer than that.
We're ready.
Good luck, Number One.
Energize...
What can you tell me?
The house is a typical settlement
structure with adaptations. Its
thermal properties all seem to
conform to known materials.
If there are indicators as to why
this particular area has remained
intact, I cannot detect them.
Worf, the interior of the house.
One individual is located at the
south end of the house, the other
toward the north. There is a
weapon -- a low-yield phaser,
nonfunctional -- in proximity to
the front-room individual.
I guess a frontal assault is
unwarranted. Stay here. I'm
going to try an old-fashioned
knock on the door.
Commander, there's a --
Who's there? Who are you people?
Commander William Riker, USS
Enterprise, and crewmembers. May
I get down and approach you, sir?
You leave him right where he is.
Commander, shall I incapacitate
him?
No.
We're a rescue party. We picked
up your colony's distress call
and came as fast as we could.
Kevin, what are you doing? Can't
you see they're here to help us?
Can't you see they're human?
Stay in the house, Rishon. It
could be some kind of trick.
We'd just about given up hope.
We thought maybe the whole
Federation had been attacked.
Do you know of any other
survivors?
It's been days since we've seen
or heard anybody else...
Please, no -- don't tell me we're
the only ones...
They came in a spaceship so big
you could see it up in orbit.
They took our world apart piece
by piece.
Who?
We don't know. We never saw
their faces.
You don't know where they came
from -- where they are now?
I guess they've gone away.
I'm sorry. I'm only performing
a physical. Could I have your
names please -- for the record.
I'm Rishon Uxbridge... and this
is my husband Kevin.
Botanists. Originally from the
aquatic city New Martim Vaz in
the Atlantic Ocean on Earth.
Residents of the Rana Four
colony for five years.
You, ma'am, are eighty-two years
of age and a composer of
Tao-classical music.
You, sir, are eighty-five years
of age and a specialist in
symbiotic plantlife. You have
been married fifty-three years.
I memorized the colony register
on the way to Rana in the event
such information was needed.
Is something wrong?
Your house -- with your permission
I'd like to look inside.
Why? What could interest you
in there?
Mister Uxbridge, as far as we've
been able to determine, you and
your wife -- and this house --
are all that survived the attack.
It was either a bizarre
coincidence or by design. I
don't favor the coincidence
theory.
Are you saying we were left alive
intentionally?
Yes.
I don't understand. You don't
think Rishon and I did something
to merit our survival, do you?
I mean, betrayed the others... ?
I'm not accusing you of anything,
Mister Uxbridge. The attacking
force spared you for some reason.
We're only trying to find out why.
May I look inside... ?
I said you could.
I'll make a cup of tea for
everyone. We have wonderful tea
on Rana. It grows wild nearly
everywhere...
Sir, may I say that your attempt
to hold our away team at bay with
a nonfunctioning weapon was an
act of unmitigated gall.
Didn't fool you, huh?
I admire gall.
Excuse me. Out front -- that
was about the best job of
concealing a snare that I've ever
seen. Could you tell me what it
was for?
Got a local critter that's
developed a taste for what's in
the garden.
Guess I should've dismantled it.
Guess I don't have to worry about
him anymore.
Go ahead. Pick it up. It's a
music box. It's been in my
family for generations.
I've been in every room. There's
nothing unusual about this house
except that it's here. What about
them?
They're in reasonably good health.
Both show signs of mental stress.
Understandable considering what
they've been through.
But somehow they're different.
Let's get back to the ship. We'll
take them with us.
Excuse, Mrs. Uxbridge. We have
to return to the ship now.
Commander, I haven't finished
fixing your tea --
I'm sorry, but we're finished
here. We can give you and Kevin
time to pack. You can bring as
much as you want.
What do you mean pack?
You're not thinking of taking us
with you, are you?
Surely you don't want to remain
here. How will you take care of
yourselves?
Kevin, I can't leave my home!
Don't let them do this to us.
No one's going to make us leave.
You'll be protected on the ship.
You could still be in danger on
Rana.
Commander, we appreciate your
concern but we're not going
anywhere. We'll manage. We
always have.
All right. I can't make you come
with us. Are you familiar with
one of these... ?
We'll remain in this system for
the next several days at least.
If you should reconsider, please
contact us.
We'll be fine, Commander. We have
each other...
Are they collaborators? Did they
in fact provide their colony's
assailants with something that
abetted the total destruction of
Rana Four in order to protect
their own lives?
What could two botanists in their
eighties possess that could
possibly aid whoever attacked this
planet?
We have no idea what the enemy
needed, Doctor. Love, fear, hope
-- a cup of tea. It is a strange
universe we live in.
Maybe they're being held hostage
in some fashion.
Nothing in the tricorder readings
indicated emotional stress.
Counselor... ?
Counselor Troi... ?
I'm sorry... I can't sense them
well enough...
Specimens...
Maybe they've been preserved as
specimens... pets... trophies...
exhibits in a zoo...
No. The assailants would have
picked someone younger for that,
someone who would have given them
a proper show for their money.
Number One, you say the couple
is incapable of sustaining
themselves?
There's a fusion reactor in the
house, probably good for another
five years of power. But their
watertable is tainted and they
have no way of feeding themselves
other than a small garden.
They won't come to the ship?
They were adamant.
We'll do all that we can to help
them... but in the meantime I want
them kept under surveillance.
Counselor, is something wrong?
I'm sorry... I don't feel well.
I would like to go to my
quarters...
By all means.
Is there anything I can do?
Captain, a search of the Ranian
system has determined that the
hostile force that attacked this
planet is no longer present.
I remember a Starfleet admiral
saying the same thing about some
renegade Andorians in the
Triangulum system once. The truth
was they'd dismantled their ship
and hidden it.
Those Andorians did not have to
contend with someone of my
thoroughness. I will stake my
reputation.
Don't listen... think of something
else...
Stop... please stop!
Yes --
I was concerned. I came to see
if I could be of any help.
I'm fine. There's nothing wrong.
I'm tired, that's all.
I don't have your gift for reading
emotions, Counselor, but I can
tell when someone is in pain and
hiding it.
It's silly... I... I hear music.
Music that won't stop. In my
mind.
Perhaps it's a symptom of
fatigue. We've all been inflicted
one time or another with the song
that wouldn't quit.
No... it's deeper than that. The
song never stops for an instant.
It plays in perfect clarity from
beginning to end over and over
again.
I don't even know what song it
is -- I've never heard it before!
When did this start?
A few hours ago. While the away
team was on the surface. I was
trying to... I was thinking of
Rishon and Kevin...
Rishon and Kevin... And?
I can't explain. They're elusive.
They're... I'm sorry...
Get some rest. Take the necessary
sleep inducements if you have to.
Data, give us a visual.
Magnfication factor fifty.
Where did that come from?
Apparently it was riding a
Lagrange point behind Rana
Four's furthest moon.
Our vehicle classification index
can put no identity to it. Its
design is completely foreign.
But it's our boy -- roughly five
times our mass and carrying enough
armament to pulverize a planet.
Lieutenant Worf... ?
I... cannot explain this, Captain.
It's moving toward the planet.
Open a hailing frequency, Data.
Ask them to identify themselves
and to match orbit with us.
They have received the message,
Captain, but are chosing to ignore
it.
Worf, maximum shields, ready all
weapon systems.
Aye, sir.
It's assuming an attack posture.
Don't be surprised if --
The vessel is firing jacketed
streams of positrons and
antiprotons, equivalent firepower
of forty megawatts. Shields are
holding.
Again forty megawatts. No damage.
If that's as good as they can do,
this'll be over in five minutes.
Worf, fire phasers... Just a
warning shot. Data, repeat the
order to stand to.
The vessel has assumed a course
out of the Rana system and is
rapidly increasing velocity.
Helm, initiate pursuit.
Aye, sir.
The vessel has reached warp two
and continues on a steady
acceleration curve. We aren't
getting any closer, Commander.
Give us a superior curve, Mister
Crusher.
Warp three... warp four... The
warship is simultaneously matching
our curve point per point. Warp
four point five... warp five...
warp five point five...
Riker to LaForge. Give us
everything you can to close the
gap, Geordi.
Yes, sir. I'll get you to
Nine point three seven in fifteen
seconds.
Warp eight point five... warp
eight point seven five... warp
nine... the warship continues to
match our acceleration curve
perfectly.
I get the impression we're being
toyed with, Number One.
This ship will not chase a pony
on a merry-go-round. Number One,
take us back to Rana Four.
Back?
We have unfinished business
there. I need to have a talk with
those two people.
Reduce speed. Bring us around
on a return course.
This one's getting away...
Good afternoon. I apologize if
I startled you. I'm Jean-Luc
Picard, captain of the Enterprise.
I've brought you something you
badly need if you're going to stay
on Rana -- a matter replicator.
It has limited capabilities, but...
Thank you. But we have no use
for such a thing.
It will provide you with food
and clothing -- clean water.
Lieutenant Worf can instruct you
in its operation.
We don't need it.
Kevin, you know we do.
Thank you, Captain.
Kevin and I were about to have
our afternoon tea. You and Mister
Worf must stay and have some with
us.
We'd like that very much.
Rishon, they only want to spy on
us like this morning.
Kevin, I've never turned away a
visitor to this house and I'm not
starting today.
Please come in, both of you. And
excuse the mess...
Stop -- make it stop! Please,
I'll do anything -- make it stop!
Deanna, please. I'm here to help.
It's getting louder! So loud...
I can't stand it -- make it stop!
Move her to the bed.
This will relax you.
I hear it! It's still there!
It's so loud --
Move her to Sickbay.
No! I want to stay in my
quarters.
I can get you to sleep there.
I don't want to sleep! The music
will only follow me!
I can induce delta sleep... Tune
out even your deepest dreams.
But it's not a dream! You've got
to understand that! It's not a
dream -- it's real!
Kevin and I first saw each other
on a ship at sea. He was a
starving student in a threadbare
suit and mismatched shoes. I was
traveling with my parents who
didn't like the way he was hanging
around. I asked him to marry me
two hours after we met and he knew
I was serious. I don't think he's
ever recovered from that day.
Mister Worf, what do you think?
Good tea. Nice house.
Why did you leave Earth and move
to a brand new world when you did?
You mean at our age? We thought
it would make us fall in love all
over again.
It worked.
It must've been terrible... when
the colony was fighting for its
life.
Yes, it was. Fire lit the sky...
the ground never stopped
shaking... there was thunder,
unbelievable thunder...
But you survived...
We don't know why we did and the
others didn't. I've tried to put
some purpose to it, but I can't.
I was wondering, Captain, when
you and your ship would be
leaving...
I don't have an answer for that.
A few hours ago we had an
encounter with a warship...
Possibly the one which attacked
you. We forced it to leave the
system but were unable to affect
it otherwise. It could return.
Kevin -- you said it'd gone away.
I guess I was wrong. Don't worry.
It didn't hurt us before, it won't
hurt us now.
Do you know that for a fact,
Kevin?
No. But I don't enjoy seeing my
wife frightened. As we've told
you time and time again, Captain,
we don't know why we were spared.
But there had to have been a
reason. In some way you and
Rishon were "different" from the
other colonists. Your
geographical location, your
philosophical beliefs, the color
of your eyes -- somehow you stood
apart from them.
There was a difference... I am
a man of special conscience.
While the others were doing what
they could, I chose not to fight.
That is your protected right.
But I assure you the attacking
ship had no way of realizing this.
I expected to die like all the
others.
There's no reason for you and your
ship to remain, Captain. We can
manage without you.
Kevin grieved for the others but
he did nothing. He's a very
gentle man. Please understand
that.
What about you, Rishon? Did you
feel the same way?
I wanted to fight... but I stayed
with my husband. Thank you again
for the replicator, Captain. I
had better clean up now...
Before we go I ask you one more
time to come to the ship. For
your own safety.
I'm frightened, Captain. But I
can't leave Rana. Even if it
means my life.
I don't understand it. I've
inhibited almost all the activity
of the neocortex and she
continues to behave as if she's
hearing the music...
We're going to have to shield
her from all outside stimuli by
inducing coma...
I have positive identification,
Commander. It is the vessel that
attacked us earlier. It is
reentering the system at high
velocity and is approaching
Rana Four.
Give us a tight visual, Data.
Is it my imagination or does it
look a lot meaner this time?
Shields up. Weapons ready.
Our friend is back.
I am not surprised. Lieutenant
Worf, open a hailing frequency.
Warn the vessel to stay clear of
the planet.
Aye, sir. But they are already
within firing range.
Shields down! Captain, they hit
us with four hundred gigawatts
of particle energy!
Damage?
Superficial -- but I am having
trouble reassembling the shields!
Shields down! There is thermal
damage to the hull!
The warship is in possession of
enormous energy reserves. It is
capable of striking us with
far more powerful bursts.
They're maneuvering to come
between the Enterprise and Rana
Four.
Number One, we have been exemplary
in our patience.
Lieutenant Worf, fire phasers on
full with a simultaneous spread
of torpedoes.
The vessel appears undamaged.
Its defenses are apparently able
to absorb incoming matter and
energy.
Commence rapid fire with all
weapons on full!
Shields are down! There is
internal damage -- weapon systems
control has been lost!
Riker to Sickbay. Medical
assistance to the bridge!
Mister Crusher, move the
Enterprise out of range of the
attacking vessel!
The vessel has terminated its
pursuit. It is assuming an orbit
around Rana Four.
Rishon and Kevin...
We can't help them... But it's
my guess they're in no danger.
Number of casualties?
Sixty-six.
Fatalities?
None. We've been able to treat
everyone.
Can you help her?
I've done everything I can. I
don't understand the nature of
this music she says she's hearing,
or where it's coming from.
Could it be telepathic?
Yes. But I'm no expert at
determining that.
They're blocking her sensitivity
... keeping her from "seeing"
the truth.
Who?
Rishon and Kevin.
What?
They wanted us to leave Rana...
and that's exactly what we're
doing.
Picard to bridge.
Yes, Captain.
Number One, I want you to maintain
the present course for another
hour, then turn the Enterprise
around and take it back to Rana
Four.
Sir? We still won't have our
shields restored by then.
We're going back, Commander --
and this time nothing is going
to lure us away.
Sensors indicate no spacecraft
in the vicinity of Rana Four.
But Captain --
Forget your previous error,
Lieutenant. There was no way
you could have prevented it.
Captain, the Uxbridge house is
coming into transporter range.
Lieutenant Worf. If you will
accompany me to the Transporter
Room...
I think you should reconsider
this, Captain. The warship has
come after us twice, it could come
back.
I disagree, Commander. I don't
think it knows we're here. I
think it believes it's run us off
for good. That, however, will
change once I'm back on board.
Sir?
It's protecting Rishon and Kevin.
It responds to their wishes --
directly or indirectly, I'm not
sure. That's what I'm going to
put to the test.
Celebrating?
What are you doing here? What
do you want?
This is the second time you've
shown surprise at my appearance,
Kevin. The first time was
understandable, but why now? --
unless you expected never to see
me again.
Why do you keep interfering with
our lives, Captain?
It isn't my intention to
interfere, Kevin... only to help
you and Rishon.
Then please leave us alone.
I promise you that once I leave
this house I will never set foot
in it again. The Enterprise,
however, will remain in orbit over
this planet.
Why?
To protect you.
That isn't necessary, Captain.
I thought you understood.
But it is necessary, Kevin. Your
lives are in great danger. The
warship has returned.
Kevin --
He's lying, Rishon.
We fought a pitched battle with
it and lost. Many of my crew have
been injured -- including a woman
who's mind is slowly being
destroyed by a telepathic
aberration.
No! Oh please no!
This is a form of intimidation.
I have my rights --
You, Kevin? What about Rishon?
Is she in favor of being left
at the mercy of a homicidal
spaceship?
I think you'd better go,
Captain...
Come to the Enterprise, Rishon.
Let me take you where you'll be
safe.
No. I can't leave Kevin...
And I'm staying. She's safe here
with me in this house.
Then explain to me why you're
safe, Kevin. Why is this house
a sanctuary from a destructive
force that otherwise has no
conscience? Does it have to do
with you -- with your refusal to
fight?
Tell me this, Kevin. If Rishon
were in danger, would you kill
to save her life?
No! Not for her, not for anyone!
I will not kill!
Stop hurting him! Leave our
house!
It is my sworn duty to protect
you. The Enterprise will remain
in orbit around Rana Four as
long as the two of you are alive.
Number One -- an update, please.
Little change, Captain. The
shields are still inoperable.
We have partial control of our
weapons. I've doubled the repair
crews.
Commander. The warship is
approaching from high orbit. It
is very close -- three hundred
thousand kilometers distance.
How is that possible? Is
something wrong with the sensors?
That's of no concern, Number One.
It's here. And precisely on
schedule.
The vessel has altered its course
to a direct intercept with the
Enterprise.
Worf, arm phasers and photon
torpedos, prepare to fire.
Belay those orders, Mister Worf.
The vessel is now within twenty
thousand kilometers of the
Enterprise and closing.
Let it come, Commander. Activate
the Main Viewer.
Evasive action, sir?
The Enterprise will stand its
ground, Lieutenant.
Weapons, sir?
When I give the order. Not
before.
The vessel is entering a low
orbit around Rana Four.
Captain, it appears it is
preparing to fire at the planet.
Understood.
My calculations indicate that its
target may be the house of Rishon
and Kevin Uxbridge.
There will be no interference from
us, Mister Data.
The house has been obliterated!
Scan for survivors, Lieutenant.
There are no survivors.
Ready a photon torpedo. Fire at
the vessel when ready.
Aye, sir.
Commander Riker. What reason does
the Enterprise have to remain at
Rana?
The unknown vessel has been
destroyed. The Uxbridges have
been destroyed. There is no
reason for the Enterprise to
remain.
Good. Helm, move us to a higher
orbit so that we may keep the
surface of the planet under
surveillance.
Aye, sir. But, Captain, what do
we watch for?
Anything. If I'm needed I will
be in my Ready Room. That is all
for now.
Come.
Captain, may I speak with you?
The pleasure is mine, Number One.
We've been observing the planet
very carefully for three hours.
We've seen nothing. I have the
feeling you're waiting for
something to happen.
I have acted on an assumption,
Commander. I am not sure what
the result will be -- or even that
my assumption is correct.
We found two people alive in a
house on a devastated planet.
But there was only one survivor
of the war on Rana Four
Why is it we maintain watch on
a planet that is now totally dead?
Bridge to Captain Picard. You
had better come see this.
Captain, Commander, it's back --
the house! And the trees and the
grass! It happened right in
front of us.
Worf, do you see survivors?
I detect two life-forms inside the
house. It appears Kevin and
Rishon were not destroyed. But
how... ?
Helm, bring us into transporter
range. I want them beamed aboard
-- directly to the bridge.
Captain, will they not protest?
Let them.
My apologies if I interrupted a
waltz...
Why have you brought us here
against our will?
To end the suffering of one of
my crewmembers.
I don't understand --
Kevin does. He's the cause.
At first I couldn't figure out
why your house had survived the
holocaust while all the others
hadn't. And then it occurred
to me that it had been destroyed.
The dwelling where you served me
tea and danced your waltzes was
a reproduction, something real
to the touch but capable of being
created and destroyed and
recreated at whim.
Now you're joking with us,
Captain. Can't you see it's
hurting my husband?
Rishon... hear what he has to say.
More than anything, you wanted
the Enterprise away from Rana.
Why?
Because the house, the plot of
land, your very own existence,
were riddles you were helpless
to explain. The warship --
another recreation -- twice tried
to chase us away but failed.
When I came to the house a second
time I provided you with the only
condition that would make the
Enterprise leave -- your deaths
-- and you did your best to
satisfy me.
I am deeply sorry about the
woman. I will help her. But
I must know what you intend to
do with me afterwards...
Take you to the nearest starbase
where you will be held accountable
for the attack on this ship...
and perhaps the deaths of eleven
thousand people.
No! He hasn't killed anyone!
The destruction of the planet
happened just as I told you.
But you haven't told us the whole
story, Kevin -- how it ended...
the part about Rishon.
What is he saying... ?
I can touch you, Rishon. Hear
your voice. Smell your perfume.
In every respect you are a real
person with your own mind and your
own beliefs... but you do not
exist. You died with the others,
defending the colony. He has
recreated you just as he has
recreated the house.
You're the only living thing that
really exists on Rana Four,
Kevin. And though you look
human, you're not.
He's in the turbolift!
Let him go.
Captain -- he is dangerous!
So dangerous, Lieutenant, he could
have destroyed us at any instant
he wished. Track him. Alert the
crew to keep out of his way. I
want him to know we mean him no
harm...
Will he try to get back to the
planet?
Not if he's the creature of
conscience I think he is. He has
someone to help first...
I have taken the music from her
mind. She's alright now. She's
sleeping.
She was beginning to sense who
I really was. I've been living
as a human for over fifty years
but I couldn't hide from her.
She has suffered because of my
pride and selfishness. It will
not happen again.
What happened on Rana Four,
Kevin? The truth this time --
all of it.
Very well. For what it's worth.
I am a Douwd... an immortal being
of disguises and false
surroundings. I have lived in
this galaxy for many thousands
of years although until today no
one has known my true identity.
Once while traveling in human
form I chanced to fall in love
with an Earth woman. I put aside
my powers and became her husband.
Our life was happy and rich.
Eventually we came to this planet
to live our final years. Now she
is dead. She never knew what I
really was...
Your colony was attacked by a
warship...
Belonging to the Husnock, a
species of hideous intelligence
that knew only aggression and
destruction. I could have
destroyed them with a mere
thought, but this I did not do.
You had the power to stop them
and you didn't?
I refused to for the same reason
I refused to stop the Enterprise.
I will not kill!
So you let the colonists fight
a hopeless battle.
I tried to fool the Husnock as
I tried to fool you, but it only
made them angrier and more cruel.
And then what you feared most
happened. Rishon went to fight
with the others -- and she died
with them.
How I wish I could have died with
her...
But you couldn't. You did the
unthinkable instead. You took
revenge.
Yes! I saw her broken body. I
went insane! My hatred exploded
and in an instant of grief I
destroyed the Husnock!
Why did you try to hide this from
us? Was it out of guilt for not
helping Rishon and the others when
they were alive?
No. You don't understand the
scope of my crime. I didn't kill
just one Husnock, or a hundred,
or a thousand -- I killed them
all. All! The mothers, the
babies, all the Husnock
everywhere!
Are eleven thousand people worth
fifty billion? Is the love of
a woman worth the destruction of
an entire species... ? This is
the sin I tried so hard to keep
you from learning. This is why
I wanted to chase you from Rana.
We are not qualified to be your
judges. We have no law to fit
your crime. You're free to return
to the planet... and to make
Rishon live again.
Helm... break orbit. Full
impulse.
Captain's log, Stardate 43043.5.
We are departing the Rana
system for Starbase
one three three. We leave behind
a being of extraordinary power...
and conscience. I am not certain
if he should be praised or
condemned. Only that he should
be left alone...
