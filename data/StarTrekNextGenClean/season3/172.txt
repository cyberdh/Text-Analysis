			Captain's Log, Stardate 43980.7.
			The Enterprise has been in
			attendance at the biennial Trade
			Agreements Conference on Betazed.
			For the first time, the Ferengi
			are present, and I have
			reluctantly consented to their
			boarding the Enterprise for the
			closing reception.
			Check... and mate.
			Perfect. A queen's gambit...
			finished off with the Aldabren
			Exchange.
			Unfair. I couldn't concentrate
			with all that noise...
			It's Algolian ceremonial rhythms.
			Hyoo-mans...
			A toast to the success of the
			trade conference, Reittan. I must
			admit, I had some doubts when you
			invited the Ferengi.
			They made a profit and behaved
			themselves. What more could one
			ask? Still, they trouble me. We
			Betazeds are uncomfortable with
			species like the Ferengi... whose
			minds we can't read.
			Perhaps your telepathic abilities
			are ineffective owing to the
			anomalous construction of the
			Ferengi brain, which is composed
			of four different...
			Thank you, Data.
			It was thoughtful of you to
			include Lwaxana Troi as part of
			the Betazed delegation.
			Her first husband and I were old
			friends. And I've known Deanna
			since she was a child.
			I'm sure Counselor Troi
			appreciates this opportunity to
			spend time with her mother.
			It's so marvelous to see you,
			Deanna, darling.
			At least pretend you're happy to
			see me.
			Mother, we're among non-telepaths...
			it's impolite not
			to speak aloud.
			You mean talk with my mouth full?
			Deanna, please!
			All right, I will say something
			aloud. Have you considered if
			you had stayed on Betazed just
			where your life might have...
			Let's not guess what I might have
			done. I love my work aboard the
			Enterprise...
			I know. But all business and no
			play? You should enjoy life more,
			like I do. Find the right man,
			think of your future. Think of
			my future...
			Deanna, Lwaxana. Anything I can
			do for you?
			She is as repulsive as the rest
			of them.
			Repulsive? I find her exotic!
			And what an advantage their
			telepathy would be in
			negotiations...
			To read our competitors' minds...
			yes, that would be valuable.
			She'd never agree to use her
			powers to help us...
			I'm not so sure.
			Lwaxana Troi of Betazed, I
			believe.
			I am Daimon Tog of the Ferengi
			vessel Krayton. May I join you?
			I was just going to see Captain
			Picard. Excuse me.
			Jean-Luc! Come have a drink and
			tell me what you've been up to.
			Uh... perhaps later, Lwaxana.
			Data and I were just about to show
			Reittan Grax the new door
			mechanisms on the aft Turbolifts.
			Would you excuse us?
			Lwaxana Troi, I desire you.
			Wha... what?
			Your Betazed skills would be very
			useful to me... and I find you
			attractive. I'm willing to pay
			handsomely for you.
			I don't believe this...
			You must be aware that every
			female has her price.
			Let's get one thing straight. I
			am not for sale. And I'd rather
			eat Orion wing-slugs than deal
			with a toad-faced troll like you.
			Go find someone else to become
			your property.
			As you wish.
			Now that you've totally humiliated
			us, may we return to our vessel?
			She's exhilarating, isn't she?
			Now I want her more than ever.
			Lwaxana Troi will be mine.
			Are we at war with the Ferengi
			yet?
			Daimon Tog has returned to his
			vessel and the Ferengi have left
			orbit.
			I'm sure Mother will be relieved.
			I hear she handled the situation
			quite skillfully. An admirable
			woman.
			I'll be sure to tell her you said
			so.
			Come in, Little One.
			Mother.
			Mother, please.
			Just a moment, Little One. I'm
			at one with All Being.
			After that horrible little Ferengi
			insulted me, I needed to center
			myself.
			Can you imagine that creature
			talking to me like that? Didn't
			he realize I am the Daughter of
			the Fifth House of Betazed, keeper
			of the Chalice of Rixx?
			Mother, the Chalice of Rixx is
			an old clay pot with mold growing
			inside it!
			My dear, when you become old
			enough and wise enough, you'll
			understand. Now sit down and
			talk to me. We don't spend enough
			time together.
			That's true. I'm sorry, and I
			didn't mean to be upset with you
			at the reception.
			Deanna... you must understand,
			you're all I've got. My only
			concern is for your happiness.
			I am happy. Why can't you believe
			that?
			I wish I could. How much
			happiness is there in always being
			there for someone else, but never
			being there for yourself?
			I get great satisfaction out of
			my work.
			I'm sure it's rewarding, in its
			way. But what about a family?
			This is my family -- my friends
			-- here on the Enterprise.
			I am your family, or have you
			forgotten? And if I have to spell
			it out for you, I'm talking about
			finding a husband, having a child.
			That's what made me happy. At
			least until now.
			Look, Mother. Perhaps some day
			I'll marry. But you've got to
			let me make my own choices...
			live my own life, not the life
			you'd choose for me.
			You had a chance... with Commander
			Riker. And look how you ruined
			that.
			I did not ruin anything. We
			became very good friends.
			All the better. You certainly
			wouldn't want to marry an enemy.
			But I see we can't discuss this.
			So have it your way, Little One.
			Little One? When I was five you
			called me that. Stop demeaning
			me and address me as an adult.
			I'll be home on Betazed if you
			need me, Lit --
			Deanna.
			Adding preprocessors to the
			neutrino counters boosted
			efficiency by eleven percent.
			Of course, Commander LaForge and
			Commander Data did most of the
			work...
			Not so fast, Wesley.
			Preprocessing the data with an
			optical chip was your idea.
			Correct, sir. Although Commander
			LaForge and I designed the chip,
			Ensign Crusher derived the
			equations governing its operation.
			The point is, you've completed
			our upgrade well ahead of
			schedule. Most impressive.
			Indeed, Number One. Fine work
			-- especially you, Mister Crusher.
			We're going to miss you.
			As you might guess, your final
			entrance examination scores for
			Starfleet Academy have arrived.
			Congratulations. As soon as you
			complete the oral exam, you'll
			be formally admitted.
			We'll have you back at Betazed
			in plenty of time to meet the
			Academy transport ship.
			Thank you, sir.
			That will be all.
			A moment, Number One.
			Yes, Captain?
			Your science team is very
			efficient. How many days would
			you say they managed to shave off
			our mission?
			Approximately three. Thanks to
			the equipment upgrade, we'll be
			able to complete our survey in
			less than twenty-four hours.
			Splendid, Number One.
			You'd agree that this is a rather
			routine mapping mission?
			Yes, sir...
			Counselor Troi had the good sense
			to request shore leave. I see
			I'm going to have to suggest it
			to you.
			Have a good time, Number One.
			I'm sure it was around here
			somewhere...
			It's been a few years. Maybe it
			died.
			You know Muktok plants live for
			hundreds of years...
			Here it is...
			It's lovely. I remember this
			music... and all the good times
			we had.
			A certain junior lieutenant will
			always remember meeting a very
			serious psychology student. It
			was the best thing about being
			assigned to Betazed.
			Put the food down over there,
			Mister Homn.
			Isn't it a beautiful day for a
			picnic?
			Mother! How did you know about
			this place?
			Your father used to bring me
			here.
			And you even brought provisions.
			Very thoughtful.
			Try this oskoid. The sap keeps
			it deliciously warm.
			Very, very tasty.
			Tell me, Lwaxana, the last time
			we met, you were searching for
			a husband. Did you have any luck?
			Alas, no, but what happens to me
			isn't important. I'm more
			concerned about other people
			getting on with their lives.
			Mother, this isn't the time or
			the place...
			Did I mention any names?
			You didn't have to.
			Can I help it if all my friends
			are becoming grandparents?
			How about you, Will. Have you
			ever thought of having children?
			There was a time when I thought
			having children and a career in
			Starfleet were incompatible. But
			with Galaxy class starships having
			families aboard, I've considered
			that possibility...
			Yes, the Enterprise would be a
			perfect environment to raise a
			family... with someone...
			Mother!
			Mister Homn, I saw some
			uttaberries along the path. Be
			a dear and pick some for
			dessert...
			Mister Homn and I can go back home
			if you two want to be alone. It's
			such a romantic setting...
			Mother, stop it!
			Darling, you're so excitable these
			days. Have you thought about a
			leave of absence? I could talk
			to Jean-Luc...
			Deanna, try one of the oskoids.
			They're different.
			What the... ?
			A gift for one whose beauty
			surpasses even these pericules.
			Daimon Tog! I thought the
			Krayton left orbit hours ago.
			It did. But when I tried to put
			the image of Lwaxana Troi out of
			my mind... I could not succeed.
			This is ludicrous! You came back
			to Betazed -- for me?
			Why continue to search for
			perfection once you've found it?
			And when I considered how useful
			you would be...
			I don't believe this...
			Look, Demon Tog, or whatever you
			call yourself, I am the Daughter
			of the Fifth House of Betazed,
			Keeper of the Holy Rings. And
			unless you want to create an
			interstellar incident, you had
			better beam back to your ship.
			Returning to my ship is exactly
			what I had in mind.
			Krayton, transport four
			immediately.
			No, Tog!
			Deanna? Lwaxana?
			Where are we?
			From the smell of things, I'd
			say we're aboard a Ferengi vessel.
			The Ferengi can't do this! You're
			Starfleet officers!
			Tog must have missed that chapter
			in the Ferengi Book of Etiquette.
			The Enterprise is too far out of
			range.
			Daimon... they have regained
			consciousness.
			Very good.
			What have you done with them?
			I should have known. Even their
			transporters can't be trusted.
			Why have you removed our clothing?
			Females do not deserve the honor
			of clothing.
			We are not Ferengi females.
			They're as bad as humans. Look
			at the leer on his face.
			No, his is an expression of
			revulsion. But it is a feeling
			I do not share, Lwaxana.
			It's cold in here. Do you want
			me to become ill?
			No, I don't. Farek, please
			arrange for their clothing to be
			returned.
			Thank you, Daimon Tog.
			You must forgive the Doctor. He
			is not accustomed to dealing with
			Betazoid females.
			I have a business proposition for
			you...
			Thanks, but I'm not interested
			in any of your propositions.
			Hear me out. Your telepathic
			powers could bring us both great
			profit.
			And why would I want to bring you
			profit?
			In order to keep your daughter
			alive and healthy, for one...
			Farek! There's no need for
			threats.
			Lwaxana is a sensible female...
			I don't like the sound of this,
			mother.
			I believe I can control him,
			Little One.
			I'm sure we can talk about this.
			Just the two of us.
			A wise choice. Farek, leave us.
			And you may rejoin your friend.
			And now, Lwaxana Troi, let us
			"talk"...
			Fifteen hours from Gamma Erandi,
			and the subspace static is already
			playing hell with
			communications...
			Just what we might expect in a
			stellar nursery.
			Wesley, my congratulations on
			passing your Starfleet written
			examinations. An excellent
			achievement.
			Thanks, Data. Now if I can just
			do well on the oral exam...
			You will. And when you return,
			we'll be gaining the best ensign
			in the fleet.
			Actually, there is no guarantee
			Wesley will be reassigned to the
			Enterprise. Eighty-four per cent
			of Starfleet graduates are not
			posted to Galaxy class starships
			for their first assignment.
			I never thought about that... I
			always assumed I'd be coming back
			to the Enterprise.
			I'm sure Captain Picard will
			request you... if he's still
			commanding the Enterprise when
			you graduate.
			I hadn't thought about that,
			either.
			I never thought I'd feel this way
			about leaving the Enterprise...
			and all of you.
			Is that not a part of the human
			experience -- growth and change?
			I suppose so...
			I felt the same way when I left
			my family to go to the Academy.
			But it was one of the best times
			of my life. You're going to meet
			new friends, have adventures you
			can't even imagine yet...
			I hope you're right, Geordi.
			Little One --
			-- Tog's given me something
			perfectly hideous to wear... he
			says it flatters my beauty.
			So far, mother's in no danger.
			I hope she knows what she's
			doing...
			She's bought us some time...
			let's make the most of it.
			I wouldn't do that...
			I don't need your help.
			The hell you don't. You're two
			moves away from being mated.
			Hey, I warned you. Now you've
			only got one possible escape...
			... and that wasn't it.
			See? You should've moved the
			bishop --
			Ridiculous! The bishop was
			pinned...
			Okay, don't listen. Forget that
			I beat you in thirty moves...
			Pure luck.
			I was being polite. I could've
			won in twenty moves.
			Then prove it.
			Pawn to Queen Four, King's Level.
			Pawn to King's Bishop Three,
			Queen's Level.
			I must admit, when you first
			approached me on the Enterprise,
			I was intrigued.
			You mean revolted.
			Maybe a little. Do you forgive
			me?
			Yes. With your powers we could
			be a formidable team.
			You have great strength in your
			hands.
			And you like that?
			I have always admired strong
			males.
			You are beautiful... it is
			impossible to resist you...
			Then don't.
			Initial scans of ionization
			patterns complete, sir. Now
			correlating sensor readings.
			It's almost incomprehensible, the
			amount of energy being expended...
			Actually, it is five point three
			four times ten to the forty-first
			watts... well within the norm for
			phenomena of this type.
			Perhaps... but that takes away
			none of the wonder.
			Come in.
			Hi. I brought you something...
			I hope it's small, because I'm
			taking way too much as it is...
			Your friend Guinan sent this up
			from Ten Forward. It's not to
			pack -- it's for me to propose
			a toast with.
			To a future Starfleet officer.
			Mom -- thanks.
			I won't say "give it your best"
			because I know you will. I won't
			say "make me proud"... because
			you already have. So I'll just
			say... here's to your future.
			This was Dad's...
			From the Stargazer. Do you have
			room for it?
			No... but I'm taking it anyway.
			Check.
			I'm sick of this game.
			Of course -- now that you're
			losing.
			Who's losing? I'm just tired of
			standing up.
			You can't resign now.
			It's too hard to play from in
			here. I can't even see the whole
			board.
			Ah, then you'll finish the game
			if I let you out of the cell.
			I might...
			Clever, hyoo-man, but I'm not
			that foolish.
			What -- you're afraid I'd try to
			escape? What would that get me?
			You'd still have her. And
			besides... where would I go?
			I do not trust you...
			Fine. Thanks for the game.
			Come out here.
			Now save your rook... if you can.
			... and that was my first husband.
			Not much of a conversationalist,
			but what a lover. Then I met --
			I do not want to hear about your
			other romances. It makes me
			jealous.
			My, what big ears you have. Has
			anyone ever told you how
			attractive they are?
			Some females think they are my
			best feature.
			No one has ever given me oo-mox
			like this before.
			Oo-mox?
			There is no translation. But the
			ear is one of our most erogenous
			zones.
			Then you shall have as much oo-mox
			as you desire.
			Those Ferengi have iron jaws...
			Little One --
			-- if Tog were a kitten, he'd
			be purring.
			Good work, Mother.
			According to mother, Daimon Tog
			is... extremely relaxed at the
			moment.
			Tell Lwaxana to keep him relaxed
			while we call the cavalry...
			Access to communications denied.
			All transmissions to be
			authorized by Daimon Tog.
			Let's see just how relaxed Daimon
			Tog is...
			Mother -- we're out of the cell
			and we're trying to contact the
			Enterprise... but we can't do it
			without Tog's access code. Do
			you think --
			Say no more, Little One.
			Lwaxana... you and I are going
			to make such a wonderful team...
			With your telepathy and my
			cunning, I foresee --
			-- a very profitable future.
			Subspace interference is
			subsiding... communications have
			been restored...
			Good. Contact Commander Riker
			on Betazed.
			Message coming in from Betazed,
			sir. Priority One.
			On screen.
			Captain Picard, at last. We've
			been trying to reach you for two
			days.
			Our communications were blocked
			by the nebula, Reittan. Is there
			a problem?
			I'm afraid so, Captain. Lwaxana,
			Deanna and Commander Riker have
			disappeared.
			I knew I wanted you the moment
			I saw you... you have fulfilled
			all my expectations.
			How sweet.
			Farek thought it was a bad idea...
			but I knew better...
			How clever.
			I knew best... I always know
			best...
			How repugnant.
			What?
			I said, "how romantic." I can't
			resist a man who knows what he
			wants... and goes after it.
			That's me. And that's why I'm
			Daimon of this ship... I take
			charge of every situation.
			More to the left, woman.
			Whatever you say...
			My darling, would you like
			something to drink?
			You're so attentive.
			Does your food synthesizer know
			how to make an Arcturian Fizz?
			I don't think so...
			They have certain pleasure-enhancing
			qualities.
			Mmmm...
			Let me teach the computer how to
			make one.
			I'll need your access code...
			Yes, beloved... Computer -- access
			code Keh-ee Yoor-ee Dah-teh-ee
			--
			Tog! Be silent!
			I knew you were not to be trusted.
			Doctor Farek! I was... going to
			make Daimon Tog a drink...
			Save your lies for this fool...
			Daimon Tog, he's misunderstood...
			Don't listen to him.
			No -- you've misunderstood.
			You've been tricked by a sly
			female who finds you repulsive.
			She was only trying to serve...
			You almost gave her complete
			access to the ship's computer...
			... a security breach severe enough
			to cost you your command!
			It's time you took my advice.
			Let me study her.
			Study her? Your mind probes could
			kill her.
			You brought her aboard for her
			telepathic powers. If I can
			determine what neural
			configuration gives her those
			powers, we may be able to
			duplicate them. We could still
			profit from this.
			I don't know...
			A true Daimon would not be blinded
			by lust. Give her to me or I will
			be forced to report your
			transgression.
			Very well... take her.
			I wish I had some answers for you,
			Lieutenant Worf.
			Mister Homn was no help?
			None. He last saw them as he was
			leaving this clearing. When he
			returned, all three of them were
			gone.
			Lieutenant Foley found these in
			the pond. The species is Zan
			Periculi. It is not indigenous to
			Betazed, but to Lappa IV... a
			Ferengi world.
			We now have a reasonable
			hypothesis as to whom.
			The difficult question is where.
			The Ferengi ship is almost as fast
			as the Enterprise... she could
			be just about anywhere by now.
			Commander Riker will assume that
			we'll be searching for them...
			he'll find some way to send us
			a message.
			Mister Worf, I want continual
			monitoring of all Ferengi subspace
			frequencies. Mister LaForge,
			can you extend our sensor range?
			If I narrow the band and tie in
			long-range sensors to the subspace
			scanners, I can boost the gain...
			Make it so.
			Do you wish to leave orbit?
			Not until we have someplace to
			go.
			I've tried everything I know...
			and it's no use. Without Tog's
			security code, I can't get near
			the communication system.
			We're running out of time...
			Farek's about to begin the neural
			scan on mother.
			Maybe I'm going about this the
			wrong way. If I pick a minor
			subsystem... something non-essential...
			Like this... the warp field phase
			adjustment. All this does is
			suppress the subspace
			interference generated by the
			warp engines.
			Meaning what?
			Meaning if I set up a simple
			oscillation, I can send out a
			signal.
			The trick is to create a message
			that the Enterprise will
			understand... but that the Ferengi
			will think is just normal
			subspace static.
			What's wrong?
			Mother...
			Will...
			... we've got to help her...
			Come on.
			Thanks for the help, but you'd
			better get aboard the Bradbury
			-- they were ready to leave orbit
			an hour ago.
			Soon as we're sure this works...
			Initiating scans now, sir.
			Can we locate the Krayton?
			Ferengi transmissions are
			routinely scrambled and encoded,
			sir. Without breaking the code,
			we will be unable to identify any
			specific Ferengi vessel.
			And Ferengi codes are damn near
			impossible to break...
			Gentlemen, I have the utmost
			confidence in your ability to
			perform the impossible.
			Captain, the Bradbury is hailing
			us. They can no longer delay
			their departure.
			Mister Crusher -- now. We have
			no time for lengthy farewells.
			Good luck.
			Thank you, sir.
			The repetitive nature of the
			subcarrier pattern would imply
			a modified Greenlaw-Huffman
			encoding scheme...
			Okay, I'll reverse-engineer the
			algorithm using a Pileggi
			sequence...
			Wesley... take care.
			You too, Mom.
			Something the matter?
			We've been scanning Ferengi
			transmissions, trying to find
			the Krayton. One of the signals
			was... I don't know... familiar
			somehow...
			Something in the message?
			No -- the message was scrambled...
			It was the static.
			Where are you going?
			Sir, the Bradbury informs us they
			can wait no longer for Mister
			Crusher to come aboard.
			Captain, I think there's a pattern
			to the subspace interference I
			heard on one of the Ferengi
			messages.
			Wesley, unless you leave
			immediately, you'll miss --
			The interference itself could be
			a message. If I could just hear
			a replay of the subspace scans...
			Signal the Bradbury they may
			depart.
			Play back the Ferengi
			transmissions...
			Wait -- repeat that one. Put it
			on a continuous replay.
			Hear that popping noise? Data,
			can you filter out everything but
			that sound?
			That's Cochrane distortion... a
			fluctuation in the phase of the
			subspace field. All warp engines
			generate that kind of
			interference.
			But listen to the pattern... it's
			the Algolian ceremonial rhythm
			the musician was playing at the
			reception.
			Mister Crusher is correct, sir.
			There is a temporal correlation.
			Then it is a signal from Commander
			Riker.
			Ingenious. He selected a signal
			we'd recognize... but one the
			Ferengi would dismiss as static.
			Signal source located, Captain.
			Plot an intercept course.
			Course plotted and laid in, sir.
			Well done, Mister Crusher. Warp
			Eight.
			Aye, sir.
			Engage.
			Get away from her.
			Standoff, Commander.
			Tog, can't we strike a bargain?
			All I'm concerned about is my
			daughter's safety... what happens
			to me isn't important.
			What are you suggesting?
			Let me be candid, Daimon Tog.
			Deanna is of no use to you. She's
			only half Betazoid. And if you
			keep Riker, Starfleet will never
			stop searching for you.
			If you release them, I'll stay
			with you willingly... and use my
			telepathy to aid you in your
			negotiations.
			I will also show you some of my
			other exotic skills...
			A tempting offer. I would like
			to believe you.
			The offer is genuine. I give you
			my word as a Daughter of the Fifth
			House of Betazed.
			Lwaxana, don't.
			I've made up my mind.
			I can't let you do this...
			William, I'm a grown woman. I
			can make my own decisions, and
			I'm fully capable of entering into
			a contract.
			Mother -- we can't just leave you
			here --
			Yes, you can -- before he changes
			his mind.
			Please, Little One. Do as I
			say... just this once...
			Do we have an agreement?
			You have my word. I will release
			your daughter and the Commander.
			Oo-mox is only the beginning...
			Daimon -- we are being hailed by
			the Enterprise -- they demand the
			return of the captives --
			The Enterprise has found us --
			Slow to impulse... raise
			shields. Inform the Enterprise
			that two of our guests are ready
			to return. The other will be
			staying with us -- at her request.
			Daimon, I must protest --
			There is nothing to protest.
			Lwaxana will cooperate...
			therefore we have gained what we
			set out to gain.
			But you cannot trust her --
			Lwaxana has given her word. Now
			leave us.
			You're both all right?
			None the worse for wear.
			My mother bought our freedom,
			Captain. But believe me, she
			doesn't want to stay with Tog.
			Hail the Krayton.
			Sir, Daimon Tog responding.
			Captain Picard, so good of you
			to meet us. We were on our way
			to Betazed to return our guests.
			Of course you were. But you're
			still holding Lwaxana Troi.
			When will you get it through your
			thick head that it's over between
			us, Jean-Luc?
			I think I know what she's doing.
			You must fight to get her back,
			Captain.
			It's not over, Lwaxana. You're
			mine and I refuse to let you go.
			Return to my side immediately.
			You mean... you still care?
			"My love is a fever, longing still
			For that which longer nurseth the disease."
			Tell me more...
			"In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
			For they in thee a thousand errors note;
			But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise;
			Who in despite of view is pleas'd to dote."
			You didn't tell me that you and
			Captain Picard were --
			You said you didn't want to hear
			about all my romances.
			I have a new love, Jean-Luc. And
			you can't keep killing all my
			lovers. That simply has to stop.
			Killing?
			He's insanely jealous.
			Listen, Tog, no one possesses
			Lwaxana but me. And if I have
			to destroy your ship in the
			process, so be it.
			Captain, I had no idea Lwaxana
			was your woman.
			Don't let him threaten you. You
			can defeat him.
			The only way you'll get me back
			is over Tog's dead body!
			That can be arranged. Mister
			Worf, arm all phaser banks and
			photon torpedoes. If my beloved
			is not in my arms in ten seconds,
			throw everything you've got at
			the Krayton.
			But you'll destroy Lwaxana!
			'Tis better to have loved and lost
			than never to have loved at all...
			Eight, seven...
			No, wait!
			Six... five...
			Beam her to their Bridge... now!
			Three... two...
			You wonderfully jealous fool.
			I trust there will be no further
			action taken against us?
			Such as reporting this incident
			to your superiors who may question
			your competency as Daimon? I'll
			think about it.
			Screen off.
			Thank you, Jean-Luc. You were
			most convincing.
			You certainly convinced me...
			Mrs. Troi, I'm truly grateful that
			you risked your life for my...
			...people. I'll have you home
			within hours.
			Really, that isn't necessary,
			Captain...
			I'd love to hear more of that
			poetry...
			Perhaps another time. Mister
			Crusher, set course for Betazed.
			Warp Nine.
			There's so much to talk about,
			Little One... such as your future.
			Reittan Grax was telling me the
			other day that he has the nicest
			nephew...
			You asked to see me, Captain?
			I've been in touch with Admiral
			Hahn at Starfleet Academy.
			The Admiral regrets your missing
			the oral examination and hopes
			you'll reapply next year.
			I understand, sir.
			I do intend to reapply.
			In the interim... the Academy's
			loss is our gain. I'm gratified
			the Enterprise will continue to
			benefit from your talents for
			another year.
			Thank you, Captain.
			Is that all, sir?
			There is one more thing.
			For some time now I have been
			contemplating a certain action.
			Your conduct today has convinced
			me to take that action.
			I've reviewed your service record
			thoroughly... and I've decided
			upon the appropriate course.
			I am granting you a field
			promotion to full Ensign.
			Congratulations.
			You're dismissed.
			Lwaxana Troi has beamed down to
			Betazed, Captain.
			Notify Starfleet we are en route
			to the Xanthras system for our
			rendezvous with the Zapata.
			Aye, sir.
			Ensign Crusher, take us out of
			orbit and set course for Xanthras
			Three, Warp Factor Six.
			Aye, sir.
			Course set.
			Engage.
