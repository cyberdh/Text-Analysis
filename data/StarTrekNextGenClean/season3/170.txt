Captain's log, Stardate 43872.2.
In order to neutralize a sudden
contamination of the water supply
at the Federation colony on Beta
Agni Two, we are procuring one
hundred and eight kilos of
hytritium from the Zibalian
trader, Kivas Fajo.
Because pure hytritium is too
unstable for our transporters,
Lieutenant Commander Data has been
shuttling the material to the
Enterprise.
Data to Enterprise.
Go ahead, Mister Data.
This will be the last trip... the
remaining cases of hytritium are
now being loaded.
Acknowledged. Mister Worf,
advise Beta Agni Two that our
departure is imminent.
Aye, Captain.
At warp six, we should be there
in just over sixteen hours.
Loading is complete. I am
proceeding with departure.
Enterprise Shuttlebay Two, prepare
for docking, level one
precautions for incoming material
remain in effect.
If you'll just acknowledge this
last load, Commander...
Twenty-four point six kilos of
tripolymer composites... eleven
point eight kilos of molybdenumcobalt
alloys... one point three
kilos Bioplast sheeting...
Shuttle twelve containment field
reads nominal... Now leaving the
Jovis.
On viewer.
Containment field stable...
gravitational fluctuations within
acceptable parameters... flight
pattern...
Why didn't the containment field
hold?
Unknown, Commander.
Hail the Jovis -- I want to speak
with Kivas Fajo.
Sir, Mister Fajo is hailing us.
On screen.
Captain Picard -- what happened?
It is unclear at this time; we're
running a full analysis.
We detected no malfunctions before
the explosion. Everything seemed
to be proceeding as smoothly as
the other flights. Were you able
to save the pilot?
No.
I'm sorry.
Mister Fajo, I would like to
analyze your sensor readings of
the explosion.
Compared to the Enterprise's, our
sensors are rather primitive --
I doubt they contain any
information yours have overlooked.
Perhaps, but I want to leave no
avenue unexplored.
I understand. We'll transmit the
information.
Link established... Receiving.
Can we be of any further
assistance?
How much hytritium did we manage
to bring on board?
Eighty-one kilos.
That might be barely enough to
complete our mission, Captain...
but it's not leaving us any margin
for error.
I realize we have acquired your
complete supply of hytritium.
Do you know where we could obtain
more?
That may be difficult. The only
source I know is in the Sigma
Erani System.
Three weeks away.
And I can't guarantee they'll have
any -- for obvious reasons, no
one wants to keep it around. In
fact, even I may stop selling
it -- it's just too dangerous.
I guess we're fortunate you had
any at all, sir.
Transfer of information is
complete, Captain.
Mister Fajo, thank you for your
help.
Mister Crusher, lay in a course
for Beta Agni Two, warp six.
Aye, sir.
The Grissom is currently near
the Sigma Erani system... I'll
have them stand by in case we need
more hytritium.
Very good, Number One.
Course laid in, sir.
Engage.
Gibberish...
...Starfleet... gibberish...
Enterprise.
Wondrous. The detail... the
balance. A remarkable piece of
work.
Why have I been brought here?
The voice simulation is perfect.
Inflections, timing...
It took a lot of effort to get
you here... but I was sure it
would be worth it. I was right.
I have been delivered here against
my wishes. I would like to know
the reason.
Certainly. You're here for my
enjoyment and appreciation.
Am I to infer that you intend to
keep me captive?
Captive? A most inappropriate
description, my good android.
May I call you Data?
It is my name.
I know.
Data, you will be catered to,
fawned over... you will be cared
for as never before... every wish
will be fulfilled...
I wish to leave.
Almost every wish.
This is unacceptable. I have no
desire to remain here... and even
if I did, my Starfleet duties
would not permit it.
Single-minded, isn't it?
Very persistent...
But polite. A nice touch.
I decline to allow you to leave.
Then I am forced to attempt
escape.
Ten androids like you might be
able to force it open.
But there aren't any other
androids like you, are there?
It's keyed to the touch... reads
galvanic skin response, DNA
patterns, and two or three other
things. Trust me... you can't
open it.
Then you will have to open it for
me.
I wouldn't try that again.
It's a proximity-actuated field
that impedes positron flow. Not
good for your brainpaths in the
long term.
I fail to understand the value
you place upon my presence.
Do you? Look around. This room
contains items gathered from half
the galaxy.
The very first Basotile ever
created by the Rodulans...
centuries old. Priceless. A vase
carved by the late Mark Off-Zel
on Sirrie Four. The only known
Roger Maris trading card from
Earth circa 1962... smell it...
Bubblegum... I've preserved the
scent...
A Lapling...
But I thought they were extinct...
Yes, that is the general belief.
She's the last surviving member
of her species... defenseless
little creature, pity.
Everything you see -- the only
one of its kind. Unique. An
original. Just as you are.
Here, this is for you... your
place of honor... sit... if it
is not comfortable... but of
course, you have no thought of
comfort, do you...
When Palor Toff learns of this,
he will swallow his tongue with
envy... I cannot wait to see his
face...
You are the crown jewel of my
collection. A treasure beyond
comparison.
You should be flattered.
I am not. Most intelligent
lifeforms find involuntary
confinement offensive and
inequitable. Moreover, you have
violated Federation law --
Yes, I know. What I've done is
evil, selfish, immoral, illegal,
and unprincipled.
I've learned to live with it.
The Andorians wish to bid for the
shipment of Tellurian spices you
offered.
They've had four days... they
would have to make up their minds
now. Ah, well...
I must emphasize, Mister Fajo,
that I consider this captivity
a hostile act on your part.
You'll get used to it.
I can't believe he's gone.
I always thought he'd outlive us
-- by centuries.
He'd been working on this for
months... never felt it was quite
finished...
You know what a critic Data was...
especially about his own work.
It was a gift from the captain.
Then he should have it back.
Those should go to Commander
Riker.
Data always fell for Riker's
bluffs...
These are some of Starfleet's
highest honors.
Not bad for a walking pile of
circuitry and memory cells.
I keep going over and over the
accident in my mind. Trying to
figure out what went wrong. I
can see him in the shuttle...
almost like I'm sitting next to
him... going through the
departure sequence... What the
hell happened? Why didn't I see
it coming? Did I miss something...
Kivas wishes you to wear this set
of clothes. And sit in your
chair.
I have no reason to accede to
Mister Fajo's wishes.
He will give you reasons if you
force him to.
He is deluding himself if he
believes he can keep me here.
The Enterprise is certain to find
me --
They're not even looking for
you... they believe you're
destroyed. Your shuttle blew
up... a hytritium explosion.
They will scan the debris and
discover I was not aboard...
They'll find exactly what they
expect to find: traces of your
component elements. We placed
them aboard the shuttle in just
the right proportions.
Plainly Mister Fajo has no moral
difficulties with my imprisonment
here.
"Mister Fajo" has no moral
difficulties. At all.
Do you?
Clever, android... Is it part
of your program to seek out
vulnerabilities in your enemies?
Yes.
Are you my enemy?
I obey Fajo. And so does everyone
on this ship.
Why?
You are a curious... thing...
aren't you... ?
Do you object to the question?
Kivas finds a way to get what he
wants from his people. His
rewards for loyalty are lavish.
His punishments for disloyalty
are equally lavish. You won't
find anyone here who'll help you
escape.
Face it, android. He has you.
It appears he has us both.
Computer, did the containment
power supply or the backups fail
prior to the explosion?
Telemetry indicates no
interruption in containment field
power supply. Backup safety field
and reserve power was available
up until the instant of
explosion.
Analyze telemetry from gravity
generator, impulse vents, fuel
cells, inertial dampers, and
related subsystems.
All readings negative.
What about external factors?
Local stellar phenomena?
Negative. Interstellar radiation
and EM spikes all within normal
tolerances.
Was the shuttle close enough to
the Enterprise to have been
affected by our warp fields?
Negative. Warp systems were
operating at twelve percent idle,
insufficient to disrupt
containment fields.
Return file to start... Let's
go through it all again...
The reason I can't find anything
is there's nothing there to find.
I've run the analysis a dozen
times over... there's no
indication of a malfunction...
No possible explanation at all... ?
Well, yeah, there's one, but I
don't believe it. Pilot error.
I know it's hard to accept, but
even the best...
Captain, it's not hard to
accept... with Data, it's almost
impossible. I can't even begin
to calculate the odds. If Data
were here, we could ask him...
What are you suggesting,
Commander?
I don't really know, sir. It just
doesn't make sense. I like things
to make sense... that's all.
Geordi, if you got a little rest,
came at it with a fresh mind...
A little rest isn't going to
change the computer analysis,
Commander.
I'm sure you've done a complete
investigation. If you wish to
continue it, you have my support
of course. But we'll be reaching
the Beta Agni system shortly.
I expect you to be rested.
I understand, Captain.
Dismissed.
Geordi... I understand how much
we want... even need to explain
an accident like this. Sometimes
there just aren't any
explanations.
For an android without feelings...
he sure managed to evoke them in
others.
We must select an officer to
replace Data at Ops.
Recommendations?
My first choice would be
Lieutenant Worf, sir.
Mine as well. Make it so.
(One line of Shakespeare that
provides the perfect epitaph to
Data.)
You're still wearing your uniform.
Why?
I am a Starfleet officer.
You're not in Starfleet any
longer. It's time you adjusted
your program to accept reality.
Even if I chose to do so, it is
doubtful whether my programming
could be sufficiently altered to
accede to your wishes.
Oh?
I have been designed with a
fundamental respect for life in
all its forms... and a strong
inhibition against causing harm
to living beings.
A military pacifist. What a
marvelous paradox. Tell me --
whose dreadful decision was it
to enlist you in Starfleet?
It was ultimately my own decision.
My skills seemed appropriate...
My dear Data, it was a mistake.
A grievous error. You no more
belong in Starfleet than I belong
in a verbal contract. Have you
killed yet, Data?
No, but I am programmed with the
ability to use deadly force in
a cause of defense.
Shame on you.
Shame on you. How neatly you
rationalize your capabilities.
How can you casually accept your
role in murder?
I would not participate in murder.
Perhaps you misunderstand...
Can't you see how much better it
will be for you here... the
intellectual rewards, our own
personal exploration of the
galaxy... I am at war with no
one... I have liberated you.
You are a fine debater, sir. It
is a shame you have used your
verbal gifts for mere hucksterism
and the advancement of your own
greed.
You're going to be more of a
challenge than I thought. Put
on the new clothes and sit in your
chair.
I must decline.
Finoplak. One hundred denkirs.
Here's something for your logic
circuits to analyze.
Don't worry -- the solvent won't
damage your skin. But in minutes
it will completely dissolve your
uniform.
I'd be delighted to have you go
naked... I assume you have no
vanity. But I would guess that
decency is the rule of your
Starfleet training.
So, decide which alternative you
dislike the least.
Decide by dinnertime tonight.
I have invited a guest to meet
you. I expect you to be as
entertaining with him as you have
been with me.
Proceeding with departure.
Enterprise Shuttlebay Two, prepare
for docking, level one
precautions remain in effect.
I did miss something.
Your first watch on Ops?
I've served at the position
before.
I've been concerned about you.
About me? Why?
Because I know how I'd feel if
I were asked to replace Data at
his station.
Bridge.
Promotion due to the death of a
crewmate is commonplace on Klingon
ships.
I know... but this isn't a Klingon
ship... and Data was your friend.
And it is the second time you've
replaced a crewmate who's died.
I honor Data's memory as I did
Lieutenant Yar's by attempting
to perform their duties as well
as they did.
In true Klingon fashion.
I appreciate your... concern.
Okay, computer, now replay shuttle
audio transmission... time index
zero-four-two-three...
Data's second trip...
Proceeding with departure.
Enterprise Shuttlebay Two, prepare
for docking, level one precautions
remain in effect.
Shuttle has cleared Jovis cargo
bay.
It sounds the same as the first
trip...
Exactly the same. That's
protocol. And that's Data.
Following protocol to the letter.
Computer, replay shuttle audio
transmission, time index
zero-four-three-nine...
Third and final trip.
Loading is complete. I am
proceeding with departure.
Enterprise Shuttlebay Two, prepare
for docking, level one precautions
remain in effect.
That's it. The last
communication.
He didn't report when the shuttle
had cleared the cargo bay of the
Jovis.
Of course, there really wasn't
any reason for him to make voice
contact. He knew we'd be
monitoring his position... and
any other pilot might not bother.
But Data... not following standard
procedures?
What do you think it means?
I'm not sure, Wes. I suppose he
could've been too busy... maybe
he saw something was wrong...
Without communicating it? That
doesn't sound like Data either.
Which means maybe something was
wrong with him. But there's no
other indication of that. In
anything he said or did during
the mission. None.
I'd sure like to talk to the last
people who saw him alive.
Did I mention that I've added a
Veltan sex idol to my
collection...
I have four of them.
With the pearls intact?
The pearls were added by the
Ferengi agents to increase the
value. Veltans would never
dishonor their gods with garish
jewelry.
What... is that?
Something new? And you didn't
tell me...
Mister Data, I'm delighted to see
you have dressed for the occasion.
Say hello to my very good friend
Palor Toff...
Come now, don't be shy... as if
you could be shy...
A mannequin of some sort?
It is not a mannequin. It is
Data... formerly Lieutenant
Commander Data of the Federation
Starfleet. The only sentient
android in existence.
It doesn't look particularly
sentient right now...
I fear he's playing a little game
with us...
Well, someone certainly has
played a game on you, Fajo.
I assure you it is the real thing.
Tell him.
It is an android.
A most unusual one.
Perhaps its batteries have run
down. Did it come with a
guarantee? I hope.
I am not amused. I demand you
behave normally.
Dammit, I know you can hear me!
He falls well.
I apologize for this.
Don't be silly, my friend. I'm
having a delightful visit.
Come along, Varria. You're much
more fun to play with than Fajo's
new toy.
You will regret it.
Entering the Beta Agni system,
Commander.
Slow to impulse, Mister Crusher.
LaForge to bridge.
Go ahead, Commander.
Captain, a class two probe has
been loaded with the hytritium
compound and is ready to launch.
Acknowledged.
Approaching Beta Agni Two.
Mister Crusher, take us into a
close orbit. Mister Data, scan
the --
My apologies, Mister Worf. Scan
the colony's subsurface water.
Scanning... Tricyanate
contamination is confirmed.
Levels approaching forty-two parts
per million.
Area affected?
Thirty square kilometers.
Any indication of the source?
Highest concentration is eight
kilometers west of the colony.
Adjust target coordinates.
Aye, Commander.
Captain, based on these figures,
the eighty kilos of hytritium we
have should be enough to
neutralize the contamination.
We're approaching the target
coordinates.
Launch probe.
Probe on target. Hytritium
entering water table...
disbursement slightly faster than
expected.
Sir... something unusual.
Specify.
I'm getting concentrated
tricyanate readings of seventy
grams per cubic centimeter at the
source coordinates. Much higher
than would normally occur.
Any theories, Mister Worf... ?
Possibly the result of seismic
activity.
Computer, report on geologic
instability on Beta Agni Two.
No significant geological activity
has been recorded on Beta Agni Two
since the settlement of the
Federation colony.
Another theory, Mister Worf?
Number One, perhaps you should
take an away team down and have
a closer look.
Yes, sir.
Doctor Crusher, report to
Transporter Room Three.
On my way.
Mister Worf... ?
Our relationship is about to
change.
You may expect me to use every
means at my disposal to resist
your wishes.
No, from now on, you will comply.
You will not argue. You will
begin by sitting in your chair.
Sit!
I do not intend to sit in the
chair.
You will. You don't believe it
yet. But you will.
Have you ever seen one of these,
Data?
I do not recognize it.
I'm not surprised. This is the
prototype of the Varon-T
disruptor.
The Varon-T disruptor is banned
in the Federation.
Yes. Only five were ever
manufactured. I own four. I
sleep with one under my pillow.
I sleep very well knowing it's
there.
It is a most lethal weapon.
Oh, it's much more than lethal,
Data. It's vicious. It tears
a body from the inside out, quite
slowly by phaser standards, a
tortuous, painful death.
I've always wanted to try it.
I am prepared to die. However,
I doubt very much that you would
destroy me since you assign so
much value to possessing me.
That goes without saying.
Please. Come in.
Sit down, my dear. Right here
on the sofa.
How long have you been with me,
Varria?
Fourteen years.
Fourteen wonderful years. She
was barely an adult when I found
her. Idealistic. Naive. Full
of dreams. And I made all her
dreams come true. Didn't I? At
a slight cost of course. She had
to lose all those pesky ideals.
But then maybe that was what made
these years so wonderful, watching
her lose them one by one until
none were left.
I'm going to miss you.
Fajo...
The contamination has been
neutralized. Water's clean.
Most curious.
The process of neutralization
should have taken several hours.
Naturally occuring tricyanate
doesn't respond this quickly.
Are you saying this was not
naturally occuring?
There are no natural trace
elements present in these
tricyanate crystals.
If it's artificial, then we're
talking about sabotage.
With tricyanate? That's hard to
believe.
It's slow to assimilate,
difficult to replicate, and hard
to transport. There are a lot
easier ways to poison a water
supply. A lot more effective ways
too. Toxins that can't be
neutralized. Bacteriologic agents
with no cures at all.
Can you think of any reason why
a saboteur might choose
tricyanate?
Not really.
It might pass for a natural
disaster. And since there's only
one way to treat it... with
hytritium, maybe someone figured
we wouldn't locate any... it is
hard to come by.
You know it really was lucky,
wasn't it... ?
That we were able to find
hytritium when we did. Just
enough hytritium for this crisis.
Fajo showed up in the right place
at the right time... just when
we needed him the most...
You're suggesting he created the
problem just to solve it?
Possibly.
To make a profit from his sale
of hytritium... ?
That doesn't add up. The cost
of producing tricyanate is too
expensive. He wouldn't make a
profit... quite the contrary.
Then, why would he do it?
What could he want?
Computer, biographical file on
trader Kivas Fajo.
Accessing file... Kivas Fajo: A
Zibalian trader of the Stacius
trade guild... a noted
collector...
... of rare and valuable objects
including the Rejac Crystal, The
Starry Night by Van Gogh and
the Lawmim Galactopedia...
educated on Iraatan Five...
Computer, that will suffice.
A rare and valuable object...
If Data wasn't on the shuttle...
Mister Crusher...
Aye, sir...
Set course for the site of the
shuttlepod explosion. Warp eight.
He would have killed me.
It seemed a distinct possibility.
I'm sorry I did this to you.
You can stand up if you want to.
You're... you're not what I
thought you'd be...
What did you expect?
A machine. A robot, I guess.
Not anything so... well almost
human.
Thank you.
Is something troubling you,
Varria?
Your lips. They're warm.
Thirty-seven degrees Celsius.
Adjustable. I chose this
temperature to approximate human
skin texture.
How human are you?
Physically, I am capable of
performing many human functions.
However, I have no emotional
responses.
You're not the first man I've
known like that.
Have you ever made love, Data?
I have had one sexual encounter.
But I am incapable of making love
as you describe it since I cannot
feel love.
Would you... do it with me?
Why?
Why not?
It is an act that symbolizes the
highest level of intimacy between
beings. I have told you that I
am unable to feel intimacy. I
find it difficult to accept that
you could have intimate feelings
toward me under these conditions.
Therefore you are either simply
curious. Or you have been sent
by Kivas Fajo to test my sexual
abilities.
You are just too smart for your
own good, android.
I was hoping to see a little
spontaneity but obviously neither
one of you is capable of it. This
mating dance is really quite dull.
We'll try it again tomorrow. You
may leave, Varria.
The Jovis has a maximum speed of
warp three. He's had twenty-three
hours... so we can define a
perimeter of point-one-oh-two
light years as his possible
range...
And Fajo doesn't know we're onto
him, so he probably isn't taxing
his engines by going at top speed.
He could have made it to the Nel
Bato system... maybe even the
Giles Belt...
He's a trader... he doesn't
attract customers by being hard
to find...
We could put out a coded level
two query to all Federation
ouposts within the perimeter...
Make it so.
If I help you escape... will you
take me with you?
This is not another test. He's
asleep. And there isn't much
time...
The consequences to you if we're
caught...
I know the consequences.
Fourteen years... you learn a few
things...
There's an escape pod in the aft
cargo bay...
Sir, affirmative response from
station Lya Four...
Fajo spent almost half a day in
orbit... departed just over seven
hours ago.
Mister Crusher, new
coordinates... set a course for
Lya Four...
Coordinates already laid in,
sir...
Engage.
Perhaps if I attempted to
communicate with the Enterprise...
You can't... Fajo has
communications access restricted
to the bridge. Once we're out,
the shuttlepod will emit an
emergency beacon. We'll have to
hope somebody responds before
Fajo is able to destroy us.
I have been trained in evasive
maneuvers...
We'll need a few.
Get ready... As soon as I
initiate the escape sequence, an
alarm will sound... we won't have
much time...
Varria...
This is your fault. You knew the
price for disobedience. And so
did she.
Well, there's always another
Varria.
You can't hurt me.
A fundamental respect for all
living beings. That is what you
said. I'm a living being...
therefore you cannot harm me.
You will surrender yourself to
the authorities.
Or what? You'll fire?
An empty threat and we both know
it.
Accept your fate. You will return
to your chair and you will sit
there. You will entertain me and
you will entertain my guests.
And if you do not, I will simply
kill somebody else...
Him or him maybe... anyone, it
does not matter... and their blood
will be on your hands too... just
like poor Varria's.
Your only alternative, Data, is
to fire. Murder me. That's all
you have to do. Go ahead. All
your troubles are over. Fire.
Are you searching through your
program for a loophole, perhaps?
Is there one? If only you could
feel rage over Varria's death...
feel the need for revenge... then
maybe you could fire. But you're
only an android. You don't feel
anything, do you? It's just
another interesting intellectual
puzzle for you. Another of life's
curiosities.
I cannot permit this to continue.
You can't. Your program won't
allow it. You cannot fire. You
will not...
I'm reading a weapon in transit
with Commander Data. It seems
to have discharged, sir.
Discharged... ?
I'm deactivating the weapon.
Welcome back, Mister Data. Are
you all right?
Yes, Commander. Please arrange
to take Kivas Fajo into custody
for murder, kidnapping, theft...
Arrangements have already been
made.
A Varon-T disruptor. It belongs
to Fajo.
Mister O'Brien says the weapon
was in a state of discharge...
Perhaps something happened during
transport, Commander.
So. Have you come for your final
satisfaction? You wish me to
repent? Beg for mercy? You'll
have none of it from me.
I expected none.
It seems our roles are reversed...
aren't they, Data... you are now
the collector... and I...
... am in your cage.
So it seems.
Do not count me out so quickly.
I had you once. I may have you
back in my collection again.
Unlikely. Your collection has
been confiscated pending your
trial. All of your stolen
possessions are being returned
to their rightful owners.
You have lost everything you
value.
I'm sure that gives you great
pleasure.
No, sir, it does not. I do not
feel pleasure. I am only an
android.
