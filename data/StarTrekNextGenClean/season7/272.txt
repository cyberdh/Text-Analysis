Captain's Log: Stardate 47751.2.
The Enterprise has arrived at
Starbase Three One Zero for a
meeting with Fleet Admiral
Necheyev. This visit will also
give us the opportunity to pick up
a... member of the family.
Here you go... your very own
quarters.
And they're as far away from mine
as possible, so you won't even
have to see me if you don't want
to.
Mom... you know that's not why I
asked for my own quarters this --
No, no. You don't have to
explain. There comes a time in a
young man's life when he doesn't
want to stay with his poor old
mother... I understand.
I'll come visit you in the old
Doctor's Home every Sunday.
Come in.
Is there a runaway cadet in here?
If so, we may have to call
security.
Welcome back, Wes.
Thanks.
I was, of course, not serious
about calling security. It was a
joke.
I got it, Data.
So... how's life at the Academy?
Great... just great.
But it's... good to have a break.
So do you plan on just lounging
around while we have work to do?
I'm... sure I can find some time
to help, sir.
Enjoy your time off, you've earned
it.
Thanks.
Well... I think we better let him
settle in.
Good idea. Don't sleep your whole
vacation away, Wes.
Good-bye.
See you later.
It's really good to have you home,
Wesley. Really.
Thanks, Mom.
Admiral Necheyev's just beamed
aboard. Worf's escorting her up
here now.
Good.
Earl Grey Tea... watercress
sandwiches... Bularian canapes...
Are you up for a promotion?
I'm trying to establish a new
relationship with the Admiral.
There's been a certain amount
of... tension between us in the
past.
Tension's not the word I would
use...
I'd like to get things started on
a better note this time. I want
to make her feel at ease... that
she's welcome aboard the
Enterprise...
I don't know why she wouldn't feel
welcome here.
We don't have to like her Wil, we
simply have to follow her orders.
However, maintaining an atmosphere
of confrontation serves no
purpose.
Admiral Necheyev, sir.
Admiral, welcome aboard the
Enterprise.
Thank you.
You two may leave.
Thank you, Admiral.
Captain...
Admiral, may I offer you some --
I'll come right to the point,
Captain. A situation has
developed on the Cardassian border
that...
Are those... Bularian canapes?
Yes, as a matter of fact. I took
the liberty of speaking to your
aide, Commander Wrightwell... he
said you were quite fond of them.
That was very... thoughtful,
Captain. Thank you.
You were saying something about
the Cardassians I believe...
Yes. The Federation has just
completed a very long and
difficult series of negotiations
regarding the final status of our
border with the Cardassians.
These will be the official
boundaries... you'll notice that
a demilitarized zone has also been
created along the border. Neither
side will be permitted to place
military outposts, conduct fleet
exercises, or station warships
anywhere in the demilitarized
area.
This border will put several
Federation colonies in Cardassian
territory... and some Cardassian
colonies in ours.
The agreement is by no means
perfect... neither side got
everything they wanted... but
everyone got something. And as
someone once said, diplomacy is
the art of the possible.
Those colonies finding themselves
on the wrong side of the border
will have to be moved.
The colonists are not going to be
very happy about that... some of
them have been there for decades.
It won't be easy... but it is a
reasonable price to pay for peace.
Your mission is to evacuate the
colony on Dorvan Five.
Dorvan Five... that's where the
group of North American Indians
has settled, isn't it?
Yes. They've been there for about
twenty years... they've
established a village in a small
valley on the southern continent.
Is there something wrong?
Admiral... centuries ago, the
North American Indians were
forcibly displaced from their
ancestral lands. This group on
Dorvan Five originally left Earth
two hundred years ago because they
wanted to preserve their cultural
identities.
I am aware of that Captain...
There are certain... disturbing
historical parallels here. Once
again, these people are being
asked to leave their homes because
of political decisions made by a
distant government.
An Indian representative was
included in the deliberations of
the Federation Council. His
objections were noted,
discussed... but ultimately
rejected.
Captain, the Indians colonized
Dorvan only twenty years ago...
and at that time they were warned
the planet was hotly disputed by
the Cardassians. The bottom line
is... they never should have
settled there in the first place.
Then perhaps we should not have
allowed them to settle the planet
originally. But to go to them
twenty years later and ask them to
leave what is now their home...
I made the same argument to the
Federation Council. But it took
three years to negotiate this
treaty... some concessions had to
be made... and this is one of
them.
What if the Indians should...
refuse to evacuate?
Then your orders are to remove
them... by any means necessary.
I understand your... moral
objections, Captain. If you
wish... I can find someone else to
command the Enterprise for this
mission.
No. That won't be necessary.
I don't envy you this task... but
I do believe it is for the greater
good.
I understand.
And... thank you for...
... making me feel welcome.
You are always welcome on this
ship, Admiral.
Come in.
Oh. I'm sorry to disturb you,
Mister Crusher. I assumed you
would be up at this hour. I could
come back later.
No... no, sir. I... must have
overslept. Come in.
Coffee, black.
Oh. Uh, can I get something for
you, sir?
No, that's quite all right. This
was my first chance to welcome you
back.
Thank you. I appreciate that.
So... how's Boothby?
Fine, I guess.
You guess?
I haven't seen him in a while.
To be honest, sir... Boothby was
starting to get on my nerves a
little bit.
He always seemed to have an
opinion about everything.
I mean, I know he's a very...
insightful... intelligent man...
But you'd had enough of his
insights.
That's not quite what I meant,
sir.
Well, as I said, welcome back,
Mister Crusher. I hope you enjoy
your vacation. That's really all
I came here to say.
Wes -- there you are. You've got
to take a look at this.
Remember how we always talked
about improving the quantum
efficiency by creating a new
plasma-dyne relay? Well, feast
your eyes on this.
You've only got one micro-fusion
inter-relay in here... the
converter interface will never
hold up.
Hey, I ran the diagnostics myself.
This little baby will withstand
over five hundred Cochranes of
warp field stress.
I don't think so. You better put
a secondary phase inverter in
there.
In fact, this entire subprocessor
matrix needs an overhaul.
Well, I guess we can't have all
the fancy new equipment they give
you kids at the Academy. We have
to make do with what we've got.
Read the latest paper by Doctor
Vassbinder... he has some
brilliant new theories on warp
propulsion inter-relays.
A lot of this stuff is almost
obsolete.
What's wrong with you?
Do you want my help or not?
I was doing this for you... I
thought you'd be interested in
this.
Well, I'm not.
Captain's Log: Supplemental. The
Enterprise has arrived at Dorvan
Five and I have spoken to the
Leader of the Tribal Council. He
has agreed to meet with us this
afternoon to discuss the
situation.
Anthwara... I am afraid there is
very little I can do. The
decision regarding this planet was
made at the highest levels of the
Federation.
A decision that was made over our
explicit objections.
I must point out that when you
first came to this world, you were
warned that it was the subject of
a dispute between the Federation
and the Cardassians. You were
asked not to settle here.
Do you know how long we have
searched for a home? Almost two
hundred years. Then we found this
world... Can you blame us for not
wanting to give it up?
I understand and respect the long
journey of your people. But I
believe we can help you find a new
home.
As you can see, there are three
other planets in this sector that
have environmental conditions
similar to those here on Dorvan
Five. They are all uninhabited...
and could be colonized
immediately.
And if those worlds don't meet
with your approval, then we'll
find you other choices.
You don't understand... the choice
of this world was not limited
to... "environmental conditions."
There were other... more
intangible concerns as well.
My people have always had an...
intimate bond with nature. We
think of ourselves as being a part
of it... and it being a part of
us. One of the reasons our
ancestors left Earth two hundred
years ago was because that bond
had been severed.
They began to control the weather.
We believe -- very strongly --
that nature should not be "fixed"
or controlled. Droughts and
floods... tornadoes and
hurricanes... these are natural
events. By putting man above
nature... an imbalance was
created. We could no longer live
in harmony with our environment.
I can assure you that we will not
impose a weather control system or
anything else on your people.
Whatever world you choose to
colonize will be completely yours
to do with as you please.
Captain, once the bond between us
and Earth had been broken, we had
to find a planet where we could
establish a new bond... a planet
that would welcome us. When I
came here twenty years ago, I was
welcomed by the mountains... the
rivers... the sky.
He's laughing at you, Anthwara.
He thinks you're talking about old
superstition and nonsense.
That's not true. I have a great
deal of respect for your beliefs
and the meaning they hold for your
people.
Then you should respect the fact
that this planet holds a deeply
spiritual significance for us. It
took us two centuries to find a
place where the mountains gave us
permission to use their stone for
our houses... where the rivers let
us drink from their waters... and
where the wind sang to us at
night.
We don't want to spend another two
hundred years searching for what
we already have.
Captain, may I suggest that we
adjourn for now... allow us all
time to think about what's been
said.
Agreed. We will reconvene
tomorrow.
In the meantime, I would like to
invite you all to the Enterprise
this evening as our guests.
Thank you, Captain. We look
forward to it.
Ever since you came aboard you've
been moody, sullen and rude. I
want to know what's going on.
Nothing's going on, Mom. I just
want to be left alone.
No, that's not good enough. Your
behavior in Engineering was
inexcusable.
Well, then that's my business
isn't it? I don't need you
telling me how to behave.
I shouldn't have to -- you're a
fourth year Starfleet cadet.
You're expected to have a certain
level of maturity.
Maybe I'm sick of living up to
other people's expectations...
maybe I'm sick of following rules
and regulations... did you ever
think about that?
... so I've been trying to
familiarize myself with the
history and traditions of your
people. I was quite interested to
learn that it was your grandfather --
Katowa -- who led the group of
Indians who initially left Earth
two centuries ago.
He was a... great man. When I was
a little boy, I was so proud to
know that he was my grandfather.
In fact, I think I was a little
too proud of it... I remember the
other children getting tired of
hearing me talk about him.
It must have been a very difficult
decision for your grandfather to
make... uprooting your people...
leading them into the unknown for
an undetermined amount of time...
not even knowing if you ever would
find a new home.
There was great deal of
opposition. Even my own father
was against it... but when Katowa
made his decision -- that was it.
My father never said another word.
It's never easy to leave one's
home... to give up the safe and
familiar. But there are times
when the greater good demands that
sacrifices be made... I'm sure
your grandfather knew that.
His grandson does too. But there
are also times when a people have
sacrificed too much... when they
must hold on to what they have...
even if it means standing up
against overwhelming opposition.
What do you know about your
family, Captain?
A great deal actually. My father
was a strong believer in passing
along the family history and
traditions.
Tell me about your family. We
have very strong ties to our
ancestors... we believe their
actions guide us even now.
Knowing more about your family
might help me to better understand
you.
Besides, it's always a good idea
to understand your opponent in any
negotiation.
I hope that by the end of this
matter, you won't look at me as
your opponent.
My family. Well... our roots in
Western Europe go back to the time
of Charlemagne.
Sorry I'm late.
We'll talk about that later.
Wesley Crusher?
Yes?
I am Lakanta.
I'm... glad to meet you... can I
get you a drink or --
I have been waiting for you.
For... me?
I have known you would come to us
for the past two years.
I'm... not sure what you mean.
Two years ago, I went into the
Habak and began a vision quest.
While I was there, I saw many
things... talked to many animals
and spirits... and I saw you.
There're many things you don't
understand yet... but you will.
I don't mean to be rude, but I
wish you'd stop talking about me
in the future tense.
I know your spirit's troubled,
Wesley. That's why you've come to
us. We can help you find the
answers you seek.
I just don't know what to do, Jean-Luc.
It's as if someone took my
son away and left this stranger in
his place.
In a sense, that's exactly what's
happened. Wesley left here three
years ago as a boy... but now he's
a young man. That can't be an
easy transition for a mother... or
a son.
Well, it's gone beyond just the
two of us...
I heard about the incident with
Geordi.
Have you heard about the Academy?
I called Admiral Brand this
afternoon. She said his grades
are falling... he's becoming
remote, defensive... if he's not
careful, he'll wash out next term.
I don't mean to make light of that
by any means... but I must say
that I went through the same
thing.
Oh, yes. I nearly washed out my
sophomore year... there were a lot
of different factors... my
father's death... a teenage love
affair with the wrong girl... the
point is, I realized what was
happening to me and I pulled
myself out of it. I'm sure Wesley
will do the same.
Jean-Luc... will you have a talk
with him? Maybe this is the kind
of thing a boy -- a young man has
to discuss with another man.
I don't think he wants either of
us to talk to him right now.
But he needs help.
Perhaps. But he has to want that
help. If he doesn't, then any
effort on our part might only push
him further away.
Let him work this out on his own,
Beverly.
How long have you been watching
me?
Since you beamed down.
Well, I'm here. What am I
supposed to do now?
I don't know.
I thought you were going to...
help me "find some answers".
Yes. But the answers will be to
your questions.
What questions? I don't even know
why I came here.
I told you before your spirit was
troubled. Was I wrong?
I don't know about my... spirit,
but I guess you could say I'm a
little... troubled.
Then perhaps you do have questions
to be answered. Maybe your
answers are here... maybe they're
not. Will it hurt to look?
Tell me about this... Habak. You
said you had some kind of a vision
there?
The Habak is a holy place... we
hold many of our rituals and
ceremonies there. It's sacred to
us.
What's sacred to you, Wesley?
To me? Uh... well, I consider a
lot of things... important... I
respect a lot of things... but I
don't know if I consider anything
sacred.
Stop.
Look around us. What do you think
would be sacred to us here?
Well... maybe some of the designs
on the walls... the necklace
you're wearing... ?
Everything is sacred to us. The
buildings... the food... the
sky... the dirt under your
feet... and you. Whether you
believe in your own spirit or
not... we believe in it. So you
are a sacred person here, Wesley.
I think that's the first time
anyone's used that particular word
to describe me.
So if you're sacred... then you
have to treat yourself with
respect... to do otherwise is to
desecrate something holy.
Is that... what you think I'm
doing?
Only you can decide that.
Maybe I don't have... a lot of
respect for myself right now.
Then perhaps it's time for your
own vision quest to begin.
Anthwara... I deeply regret that
we have not been able to reach an
agreement.
But, to put it bluntly, I cannot
take no for an answer.
This planet will be handed over to
the Cardassian government as per
the terms of the border agreement.
I am very sorry... but you will
have to leave.
And if we do not?
Then I will be forced... to remove
you... by any means necessary.
A familiar threat... from a white
man.
This is not a racial issue... it
has nothing to do with ancient
hatreds... or with the fact that
we have different colored skin.
I might just as easily have been
a Vulcan or Andorian captain. The
orders from Starfleet would have
been the same.
We know you won't take us from our
land, Captain.
Anthwara... I may regret doing it,
but --
When you first came to us, we
didn't know why you were the one
sent here by the Federation... but
we knew there had to be a reason.
To us, nothing is truly random.
So we searched for the true reason
you were sent. We didn't find it
until last night.
Are you familiar with the Pueblo
Revolt of sixteen eighty?
I am. Several Indian tribes rose
up against their Spanish overlords
and drove them out of what is now
called New Mexico.
Ten years later, the Spanish
returned to reconquer the area.
They were... brutal... I would
use the word savage. They killed
our people by the hundreds...
maimed thousands more.
One of these killers was named
Javier Maribona-Picard. Your
ancestor.
I was... unaware of that
incident... or of the man you
named.
But that was seven hundred years
ago and I don't see how it has any
bearing on --
That is why you have come to us:
to erase a stain of blood that
your family has worn for twenty-three
generations.
Captain... are you all right?
We should return to the
Enterprise.
Mister Worf... what's going on?
We have... unwelcome visitors.
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
Enterprise.
I am Gul Evek.
What are these people still doing
here? The evacuation should be
well underway by now.
May I have a word with you...
alone?
As you wish.
Wait here.
It was my understanding that there
would be no Cardassian presence on
this world for another six weeks.
Your arrival here may upset some
very... delicate negotiations.
Negotiations? The status of this
planet has been settled... what
are you negotiating?
I would be happy to explain it to
you... but for now, I must ask
that you and your men leave...
immediately.
We were sent here to make a
preliminary survey of the
buildings and equipment being left
behind. I have no intention of
leaving until our mission is
complete.
Very well... complete your
mission...
But, this is still Federation
territory, Gul Evek... until that
changes, this world is under my
jurisdiction... and I will
protect it.
Is that a threat?
It is a fact... and I suggest you
keep it in mind as you conduct
your... survey.
This is the Habak... the focal
point of our lives.
Strangers are not welcome here...
Wait a minute. When I asked to
come here, you said it would be --
You are not a stranger. I told
you, I've seen you here before.
What are those?
They are Mansara... dolls
representing different spirits who
come to this place.
This one looks like... a Klingon.
Yes. Our culture is rooted in the
past, but it is not limited to the
past. The spirits of Klingons,
Vulcans, Ferengi come to us just
as the bear, the coyote, the
parrot. There is no difference.
What... should I do?
Start the fire... then sit... and
wait.
What am I waiting for?
This is your journey, Wesley. I
can open the door for you, but
only you can go through it.
Is there any indication that the
Tribal Council will change their
position in the near future?
No, sir.
Then I see no other choice...
Admiral, I have every reason to
believe that these people will
resist any attempt to remove them.
I strongly urge you to request an
emergency session of the
Federation Council. The issue of
Dorvan Five must be reopened.
Captain... I made that request two
days ago. The answer was no.
I'm sorry... but you have your
orders. Starfleet out.
So much for a reprieve from
Starfleet.
Anthwara believes that I am
responsible for the crimes of one
of my ancestors against his
people...
Do you believe that?
No, of course not. I respect
their beliefs... but that can't
have any bearing on our mission.
But at the same time... I wonder
if a dark chapter in my family
history is about to repeat itself.
If these people take up arms
against us... there's no way to
foresee the consequences.
Picard to Worf. Will you come in
here for a moment?
Aye, sir.
Mister Worf... begin preparations
to remove the inhabitants from
Dorvan Five.
Aye, sir.
Wesley... Wesley...
Wesley...
Dad...
You've reached the end, Wesley.
The end... the end of what?
This journey. The one you started
a long time ago... when I left you
and your mother.
You mean... when you died.
You set out on a journey that
wasn't your own. Now it's time to
find the path that is truly yours.
Don't follow me any further.
I... don't understand.
I... don't understand.
Yes, you do. It's just hard for
you to accept.
Good-bye, Wesley. Good luck.
Dad -- wait!
Mister Crusher... Are you all
right?
Yeah... I'm fine, Worf...
Lay out a confinement beam trace
along the Southwestern edge of the
village. Be discreet -- we do not
wish to alarm the population.
What are you doing?
We are laying out Transporter
coordinates for a security
perimeter. It may become
necessary to remove these people
by force.
Worf... we can't do this. These
people deserve better than to be
taken from their homes...
I understand. But this is not the
time or the place to --
Do you know what they're doing?
They're preparing to beam you away --
to take you to their ship! You're
not going to just let them do
that, are you?
No, we won't.
Leave. Now.
Inexcusable. You defied the
orders of the ranking officer on
the scene... put the entire Away
Team in jeopardy... and made an
already tense situation worse.
Your actions reflect poorly on
this ship and on that uniform. I
want an explanation Mister
Crusher, and I want it now.
What you're doing down there is
wrong.
Captain, these people aren't just
some random group of colonists...
they're a unique culture... one
that predates the Federation and
Starfleet...
That does not change the fact that
my orders are to --
I know Admiral Necheyev gave you
an order and that she was given an
order from the Federation
Council... but it's still wrong.
That is not your decision to make,
Cadet.
Now, I don't know what's gotten
into you lately, and right now I
don't care.
But I will tell you this -- while
you wear that uniform, you will
obey every order you're given and
you will conform to Starfleet
regulations and rules of conduct.
Is that clear?
Yes, it is.
But I'm not going to wear this
uniform anymore. I'm resigning
from the Academy.
Riker to Captain.
Go ahead, Number One.
Gul Evek wants to meet with you to
discuss the... situation on the
surface.
Let him come aboard. I'll meet
with him in here.
Aye, sir.
Why are you doing this?
I told you, Starfleet's not for
me.
Dammit, Wesley.
I may not be able to stop you from
throwing your entire life away,
but you are going to stand here
and explain it to me first. You
owe me that much.
I saw Dad today. He told me not
to follow him.
You... what?
I... was participating in an
Indian ritual... I had a vision.
And in it... Dad came to me. He
told me not to follow him... that
I had to find my own path.
Is that what this is all about?
Some mystical vision told you to
leave the Academy and now you're
packing your bags?
It's more than that... I think
I've known this was the right
thing to do for a long time... I
just couldn't admit it to myself.
But you always said being at the
Academy was... the best thing that
ever happened to you.
I know. And for a while it was.
But as time went on... and
graduation got closer... I started
feeling... depressed. I thought
it would go away... but it only
got worse.
Why didn't you ever say anything?
I guess I didn't want to
disappoint you... or Captain
Picard... or my friends. You were
all so... proud of me.
I'd be proud of you regardless of
what you were doing, Wes. I love
you no matter what.
I know that, Mom. Maybe the truth
is that I was afraid of
disappointing myself.
I just never questioned the fact
that someday I'd be in Starfleet.
But when Dad said not to follow
him, I just knew he was right. It
seems... so clear now.
Maybe it's partly my fault... I
never realized the kind of
pressure we all must've put on
you... to be exactly what we
expected you to be...
I don't blame you, Mom. It was my
decision -- it always has been.
You remember the alien from Tau
Ceti who could control warp fields
with his mind... ?
The Traveller.
He told Captain Picard a long time
ago that you were... special --
like Mozart. That you were
destined for something...
different from the rest of us...
Maybe... this is the first step...
What are you planning to do now?
Well, for the time being... I'm
going to stay with these Indians.
Wes... you realize they won't be
down there much longer. The
Captain's orders are pretty
explicit on that point.
I know. But I have to go back...
even if it's just for a while.
I love you, Wes.
I love you, too.
You shouldn't be here, Wesley.
Why?
Bring them over here.
Why have you taken these men
prisoner?
They were invading our homes...
violating our privacy... this is
not their world. They have no
right to be here.
The terms of the treaty do give
them the right to... survey this
planet.
We don't recognize that treaty.
We're not going to let the
Cardassians have Dorvan Five. No
matter what the cost.
That's right. We're not leaving.
Get out of here! Go back to the
Federation and leave us alone.
This is our home. You're not
wanted here. etc.
Worf to Picard. An armed group of
Indians has taken two Cardassian
prisoners. The situation is
extremely volatile. Request
instructions.
Stand-by, Mister Worf.
Have your ship lock-on to your
people and beam them out of there
now, before something happens.
My people? What about these
Indians of yours -- they've taken
hostages. This planet is ours,
Captain, and we will not be chased
away by some unruly crowd.
Gul Evek to the Vetar.
This is Glin Telak aboard the
Vetar. Go Ahead.
Two of our men on the surface have
been taken prisoner. Prepare to
send an armed squad to rescue them
and to occupy the village.
Gul Evek, those people down there
are Federation citizens and I am
sworn to protect them. If your
troops attack the village, my
security forces will respond...
I hope you realize the
consequences of Federation
officers firing on Cardassian
troops...
I do. That's why we need to stop
this now, before it's too late.
I cannot allow you to hold these
men as prisoners.
You have no authority here.
I don't understand...
You've found a new beginning for
yourself... the first steps on a
journey that few humans will ever
take.
Who are you?
The Traveller...
I've been waiting a long time for
this moment, Wesley.
So my experience in the Habak...
my vision of my father... the
things he said to me... those were
all your doing?
I merely opened the door for
you... what you experienced came
from your own mind... your own
spirit if you wish.
I hoped that you would open your
mind to new possibilities...
And you did. You pulled yourself
out of time... don't you see?
You've evolved to a new level...
you're ready to explore places
where thought and energy combine
in ways you cannot even imagine.
I will be your guide... if you'd
like.
What about them? I can't just
leave them like this.
They must find their own
destinies, Wesley. It is not our
place to interfere.
But...
Have faith in their abilities to
solve their problems on their own.
The Cardassian ship is powering
its weapons and Transporters.
This is the Vetar to Gul Evek.
Our troops are under attack. They
are requesting immediate
assistance. What are your orders?
Evek, the last war caused massive
destruction... took millions of
lives. Don't send our two peoples
back down that path... not like
this. History is in your hands --
right now. Give us one last
chance for peace.
Gul Evek! What are your orders?
Can we open fire?
Evek to the Vetar... lock on to
our troops on the surface... and
beam them aboard.
But sir, they have been fired upon
and --
Those are my orders. Carry them
out.
Yes, sir.
I had three sons, Captain. I lost
two of them in the war. I don't
want to lose the last one.
Beam up our Away Team immediately,
Number One.
Aye, sir.
Anthwara... I want to make
absolutely sure you understand the
implications of this agreement.
By giving up your status as
Federation citizens... any future
request you or your people make
for assistance from Starfleet will
go unanswered. You will be on
your own... and under Cardassian
jurisdiction.
I understand, Captain. And we are
prepared to take that risk.
Will the Cardassian government
honor the agreement you've made
here?
I believe that I can convince them
this is an... equitable solution.
I cannot speak for every
Cardassian you will encounter...
but if you leave us alone... I
suspect that we will do the same.
Will this be acceptable to
Starfleet Command?
It will take some doing... but
with Admiral Necheyev's support,
I think they'll go along with it
in the end.
Then if there is nothing else, I
will return to my ship. I have a
rather... long report to write.
Captain... Anthwara...
I was right, Captain... you didn't
take us from our land... and you
have wiped clean a very old stain
of blood.
Captain's Log: Stardate 47755.3.
The Enterprise is preparing to
leave Dorvan Five. But former
cadet Wesley Crusher will be
staying behind. It seems that
during the crisis, he met... an
old friend.
Where will you go?
The Traveller said that my...
studies will begin with these
people. He said they're... aware
of many things... and that I
could learn a lot from them.
Just what I needed... more
studying.
Somehow I think you'll manage.
Me too.
Well... good luck, Mister...
... good luck Wesley.
Thank you, sir. For a lot of
things.
Remember to... dress warmly in
those... other planes of
existence.
I will.
Good-bye, Mom.
Energize.
