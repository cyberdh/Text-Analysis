Tell me... why is it so important
that you find this man?
We had some business dealings...
he owes me money.
If we had business dealings, I can
tell you I wouldn't disappear...
Maybe we should discuss that
possibility. But first, I have to
find him... collect the money I'm
owed...
Let me guess... you and your
friend were smuggling relics from
the ruins of Nafir...
Mmmmmm...
A dangerous game.
Maybe I like danger.
Then you've come to the right
place.
I'll be closing in a few hours.
Perhaps we can discuss this...
more privately.
If I can't find him, I'll have to
move on. Are you sure you haven't
seen him?
Human... two meters tall... smooth-headed...
no, I don't remember
anyone like that.
You're lying...
And you're Betazoid... I thought
so.
The people who come here count on
a certain amount of... anonymity.
If I started answering questions
about them... even to a very
beautiful woman... I wouldn't be
in business very long.
As a businesswoman, I'm sure you
understand.
Great story... I'll have to
remember that the next time I'm in
a knife fight...
Any luck?
I think the one over there knows
something.
He wouldn't admit to having seen
the Captain... but he said that
anyone who visited the ruins of
Nafir would probably come here
eventually... I suspect he knows
more.
Let's go.
Commander -- I told him --
My friend here tells me you might
know about the man we're looking
for.
The only reason I'm talking to
you... is that I have a sister,
too.
I explained to him... that we are
looking for the man who
impregnated your sister.
You can imagine how much this
means to me.
Family honor is important... If
someone had defiled my sister...
I would do anything... pay
anything... to find the one
responsible.
I see. And just how much would
"anything" be?
As much as... five bars of goldpress
latinum.
I think you've had too much to
drink. You'd better leave.
On your way, Yranac.
I'm sorry... but I think he wants
to stay.
Sit down.
This --
-- is my sister.
She's angry.
She has a vicious temper. I
wouldn't cross her.
You talk and you're a dead man,
Yranac.
Perhaps there is an element of
risk here that I did not fully
appreciate.
And how much more latinum will it
take to offset that risk?
This isn't about latinum.
As a man with a sister -- a sister
with a temper -- I can sympathize
with you. But...
How did you come here? Do you
have a ship in orbit?
Yes...
Then take me with you. You can
drop me anywhere you like.
Agreed. Now talk.
The man you're looking for was
here several weeks ago. There was
a group of aliens sitting at this
table... he was asking them
questions.
Who were these aliens?
I don't know. But they looked
dangerous.
They attacked him. He managed to
incapacitate three of them before
he was knocked down.
He was thrown against that wall...
and fell there.
I'm picking up some Starfleet
fiber traces... and human cellular
debris.
Can you establish a DNA sequence?
There's something strange here.
The cell structures are badly
distorted. It looks as if they've
been exposed to some kind of high
energy field.
A weapon discharge?
It could be. There are faint
traces of micro-crystalline damage
in the floor material. But I'm
not familiar with the pattern.
Who are you people?
You didn't say anything about a
weapon.
I hadn't finished yet. You'll
like this... the man got what was
coming to him. When they knocked
him down, one of them took out a
weapon... and fired.
He was vaporized.
He's telling the truth.
Doctor?
There's no question. It's Captain
Picard's DNA.
I used a multi-base progression to
regenerate the DNA. The technique
is practically flawless...
The cellular damage could have
been caused by a variety of energy
fields... it's hard to be
specific. I can't tell whether it
was the field itself that killed
him or if he was already dead
when...
I'll need your analysis for my
report to Starfleet.
It's all here.
Thank you.
I'll inform the crew.
Come.
How are you doing?
I'm all right.
The crew is pretty shaken up...
I'm arranging a memorial
service... I think you should be
the one to deliver the eulogy.
You'd be better at something like
that. Or Beverly. She knew him
the longest...
I know it won't be easy... but
it's important for all of us to
face what's happened. You're in
command now. The crew will be
looking to you for guidance --
You don't understand. I can't
give the eulogy because I won't be
at the service.
A memorial service helps to give
everyone a sense of completion.
Helps them begin the healing
process...
That's exactly the point. I don't
want to heal.
Wil --
I've got an open wound in here, it
hurts like hell, and I don't want
it to get better. I don't want to
believe that everything's all
right.
You're angry...
You're damn right. And I intend
to stay angry -- until I find
whoever's responsible for the
Captain's death.
That's pretty selfish, Wil.
Do you think you're the only one
in pain? That you have a monopoly
on loss? Well, I've got news for
you. We're all hurting... we're
all angry. And like it or not,
you've got a responsibility to the
crew. You can't just indulge your
personal desire for revenge.
That's enough, Counselor.
I'm sorry.
Deanna. This isn't about revenge.
It's about justice. The Captain
died in a bar fight... for
nothing. Somebody has to answer
for that.
Then I can mourn.
Commander. We are receiving a
transmission from Admiral Chekote
at Starbase two-twenty-seven.
Put it through to the Ready Room.
Aye, sir.
Sir.
I've read your report, Commander.
My condolences to you and your
crew. Captain Picard's death is
a loss to the entire Federation.
I see you've asked to postpone
your mission to the Argus
sector... for what reason?
I have a request, sir.
I'd like to conduct an
investigation into Captain
Picard's death.
The Dessican authorities have
jurisdiction in this case,
Commander.
I know that, sir. But frankly, I
don't have much confidence in the
authorities on Dessica Two.
There's every reason to believe
they're corrupt.
I suspect you're right. But the
question remains... are you the
one to pursue this?
Sir, the Captain's death has hit
me pretty hard. I may not be
completely objective... but no one
is more determined than I am.
I won't quit until we find out
who's responsible.
All right, Commander. I'm
officially placing the Enterprise
on detached duty. Your mission is
at your discretion. Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Ah, Commander Riker. I've been
meaning to speak to you. I was
wondering if you could move me to
better quarters. I don't care
much for the decor here.
These are the best quarters we
have.
Now that you've had some time to
relax, I was hoping you might have
remembered some details about the
aliens you saw... something you'd
forgotten earlier.
Sorry. My memory isn't what it
used to be.
You said the aliens looked
dangerous. How could you tell?
They killed someone. I'd say that
qualifies them as dangerous.
But you said that you noticed they
looked dangerous before the fight
even started. What made you think
that? Were they unusually
aggressive... ? Were they heavily
armed... ?
I don't recall.
They murdered a man in plain view
of everyone in that bar... and you
can't remember anything about
them?
Now that you mention it, I do
remember one thing...
They said they'd kill anyone who
talked about what happened.
But you offered to help us.
You're right. I saw a business
opportunity. And besides, they
were gone.
Do you know where they went?
You know who they are and you know
where I can find them.
Perhaps I do.
What do you want?
Not a great deal, Commander. Just
a shuttlecraft. I believe I'd
like to travel for a while, see
more of the galaxy. You
understand.
A shuttlecraft?
Well, here's my offer. Instead of
a ship, I'm going to give you some
time.
Time?
If you're lucky, you'll only have
to spend the next five years in
prison instead of the next twenty.
You've got twelve outstanding
arrest warrants for fraud and
petty theft in the Klingon Empire.
If you tell me what you know, I'll
pull a few strings... maybe get
them to reduce your sentence after
you're extradited.
You can't turn me over to the
Klingons. They don't just
imprison you... Do you know what
the punishment is for fraud?
Yes. I certainly do.
If I tell you what I know, you
must promise you won't give me to
the Klingons.
I'll think about it.
Perhaps you could send me to a
Federation rehabilitation colony
instead.
Talk!
The aliens were some kind of
mercenary group. They've been
operating in this sector for the
last six months.
Where do we find them?
I heard one of them mention the
Barradas system... I think they
were headed there.
You think?
That's all I know.
Riker to Data.
Data here.
Take us out of orbit. Set course
for the Barradas system, warp six.
Barradas Three is the only M-class
planet in this system, and it is
listed as unpopulated. However,
sensors have detected intermittent
energy signals emanating from its
surface.
What's the source?
The signals are difficult to
localize, but... they might be
emissions from some kind of power
converter...
Which could indicate a base or a
ship.
What else do we know about
Barradas Three?
The planet was an outpost of the
Debrune approximately two thousand
years ago. The Federation
Archaeological survey has
catalogued numerous ruins on the
surface.
Mister Worf, I want a security
detail to accompany the Away Team
to the surface. I'll lead the
team. Geordi, you're with me...
Mister Data, you have the Bridge.
Aye, sir.
Sir.
As Acting First Officer, I must
question your decision to
accompany the Away Team. If
Captain Picard were here --
He's not.
I realize that, sir. But if he
were, and he wanted to lead an
Away Team, you would tell him that
the Captain's place is --
On the Bridge. I know.
But not this time.
It's tough to get accurate sensor
readings... there's a lot of
interference in the area.
From what?
I'm not sure... it's unlocalized.
It could be atmospheric...
What do you make of this?
The ruins are ancient... but I'd
say this indentation was made
fairly recently...
There might have been a battle
here...
It doesn't look like any blast
point I've ever seen... the shape
is too perfect.
Sir, there's micro-crystalline
damage all through this area.
It's the same kind of pattern
Doctor Crusher picked up in the
floor of that bar on Dessica Two.
Commander...
I have found something.
It almost looks as if someone...
dropped them --
LaForge to Enterprise... we are
under attack...
Repeat, we are under attack...
Commander, we've lost contact with
the Away Team.
Is there a malfunction?
No, sir... the com system is being
jammed...
What is the source?
Somewhere on the surface...
Bridge to Transporter Room Two.
Can you get a lock on the Away
Team?
Negative, sir. There's too much
interference.
I'm going to try to reach those
trees. If I can get there, we
might be able to set up a
crossfire. Keep me covered...
Data to Away Team... please
respond...
Data, we've been attacked. We've
got one casualty... and Commander
Riker has been taken captive.
Sir, the mercenaries have
transported away... they must have
a base or a ship nearby. Can you
locate anything on sensors?
Commander, we're picking up a
vessel leaving orbit...
Why was it not detected earlier?
They could have been using the
planet as a shield...
Sir, they are powering up their
weapon systems.
Raise shields. Red Alert.
Damage report.
Minor hit on the port deflector...
no damage.
They're running, sir... their
speed is warp eight-point-seven
and holding. I think they're at
their maximum..
Take us to warp nine and pursue.
Lock phasers on target.
Aye, sir... we should be within
phaser range in twenty-three
seconds.
Switching to long-range
scanners...
Commander... the sensor image of
that ship is extremely weak...
it's fading...
The ship doesn't register on the
long range sensors. I'm sorry,
sir... we've lost them.
Increase the sensor field
bandwidth. Patch in the lateral
sensor arrays to enhance
detection.
It's no good... the signal's
gone... it just... disappeared.
Plot a course and take us back to
Barradas Three. Notify the Away
Team to be ready for transport.
Starfleet Intelligence has
confirmed that a ship matching
this configuration has been linked
to raids on several other planets
in this sector.
For the short time it was within
our visual range, we were able to
take sensor readings of the
mercenary vessel.
It appears to be encased in an
energy-absorbing material.
Although we can see the ship, this
energy sheath renders it virtually
undetectable to our long-range
sensors.
There must be some way to track
it.
Data, I know this is a long
shot... but if I remodulate the
long-range sensor array, I might
be able to increase its
sensitivity enough to detect the
ship.
Without a full compositional
analysis of the energy sheath, the
chances of finding the correct
remodulation sequence are remote.
Furthermore, based on their speed,
they could be as far as two-point-three-seven
light years from this
location.
That means they must still be
within this sector. If we used
all available shuttlecraft to
conduct a level-one search --
It would still take at least ten
days to complete. In that time
the mercenaries would continue to
distance themselves from us.
Sir. They have taken Commander
Riker. We must do something. We
cannot just sit here.
On the contrary, Lieutenant, that
is precisely what we must do.
Since there are no viable
alternatives, we will return to
the surface and attempt to
determine what the mercenaries
were doing on this planet. An
investigation may reveal some
indication of their purpose.
Notify me when you have assembled
your search teams.
Dismissed.
I warned you not to push the
engines so hard. Two of the power
shunts are on the verge of
collapse. We'll be lucky if we
can maintain warp six.
How long will it take to repair?
I can try to realign the warp
core... it'll take at least
eleven hours.
But I'll have to shut the engines
down completely.
We're not stopping. We can't
afford to be sitting helpless in
space. I want warp eight
available in five hours. And I'm
not going to listen to your
excuses.
What were you doing on Barradas
Three?
William T. Riker, Commander, SC
two-three-one dash four-two-seven.
All right. I am Arctus Baran...
and I don't have a number.
Now. What were you doing on
Barradas Three -- Commander?
We were studying the ruins. It
was a scientific expedition.
Don't patronize me. Those ruins
have been studied for centuries.
There's nothing new to learn from
them.
Then what were you doing there?
Don't bother, Commander, you can't
remove it. It's a neural servo.
It's connected directly to your
nervous system.
It lets me control precisely how
much pain you feel.
This setting is usually
sufficient.
However, if necessary it can go
much higher.
These devices were my
predecessor's idea... a convenient
way of enforcing discipline...
What happened to him?
He failed to discipline me
sufficiently...
This is a waste of time, Baran.
Get rid of him now.
You should be more patient, Vekor.
It can be rewarding.
We will wait. Let the memory of
his pain argue with him for a
while... maybe it will change his
attitude.
Vekor's right -- we should get rid
of him. It's dangerous to have
someone from Starfleet on board.
Dangerous? It might be
profitable. A Starfleet Commander
is a valuable hostage.
Starfleet won't negotiate with us.
But they'll pursue us as long as
we have him.
This discussion is over, Vekor.
Return to your post.
They're right, Baran, and you know
it...
I say kill him. Now.
If he has nothing to give us, then
we should kill him now and be done
with it. Everyone seems to
recognize that fact except you.
I don't need a consensus to run
this ship, Galen.
What's going on?
We're bypassing the aft plasma
couplings... the power loss should
only last a few seconds...
You should learn not to limit your
options. Riker could be useful to
us in the future.
He may not be as useful as you
think...
... if this is the same Riker I've
heard about.
And which "Riker" is that?
Commander of the Enterprise... ?
Formerly assigned to the USS
Hood... ?
That's right.
Then you must be the William T.
Riker with a history of
insubordination...
He was even relieved of duty once,
during the Cardassian incident at
Minos Korva.
How do you know all this?
I've been smuggling artifacts out
of Federation sites for years.
It's difficult to avoid developing
a... familiarity with certain
Starfleet personnel...
If we hadn't captured him, he
probably would've ended up in
front of a court martial.
I've gotten out of them before.
He's no use to us. Finish him now
or let me do it for you.
Watch him.
What have you done?
It has nothing to do with my
repairs...
I think there's a malfunction in
the engine's intermix chamber...
We're accelerating...
Plasma pressure is rising...
Where's the malfunction?
It could be any one of thirty
subsystems. It'll take time to
locate...
I don't think you're going to have
the chance. Plasma pressure is
reaching critical levels...
Seal off the intermix chamber.
I can't... the override sequence
won't engage...
It's the antimatter flow
regulator... It's locked open...
Plasma pressure has exceeded
maximum levels... eight percent
above critical and rising.
We have to jettison the core...
No! We'll be stranded here --
The flow regulator is frozen...
Let me do it.
I've had a lot of experience with
these kinds of system failures...
I might be able to do something.
Plasma pressure is eleven percent
above critical... The containment
fields are beginning to degrade...
Go!
It looks like you've got a control
logic lockout in the regulator
subsystem.
I'm going to try to run an active
bypass through the plasma flow
convertor...
Start running a phase-locked
feedback through the regulator...
I'll need about a six second
delay...
I don't take orders from you.
Do as he says!
Plasma pressure is fourteen
percent above critical...
If you fail--
We'll all be dead anyway.
Just a few more seconds...
Plasma pressure is dropping...
We're back into safe levels.
If you want to make sure that
doesn't happen again, you'd better
re-initialize the regulator
subprocessors. A full diagnostic
on the intermix chamber wouldn't
hurt either.
Do it.
Put him in quarters for now.
Still wish you'd killed me?
The search teams have reported in,
sir. They located several
archaeological sites. Each one
has been looted.
It's possible that the micro-crystalline
damage I found in
these indentations was the result
of some kind of high-energy
Transporter beam...
... but I still don't understand.
There's nothing here that's
particularly valuable. Why would
anyone want to steal any of these
things?
Perhaps these artifacts have
special value to the Romulans.
The Romulans?
These structures were built by the
Debrune. That race was an ancient
offshoot of the Romulans. And the
ruins on the planet where Captain
Picard was killed were also
Romulan in origin.
The leader of the group which
attacked us was a Romulan.
Perhaps they are controlling the
mercenaries...
But the question remains: Why are
they stealing these artifacts?
There are several archaeological
sites in this sector containing
ruins which are Romulan in origin.
These are the locations which have
been attacked by the mercenary
vessel.
It looks like they've done a
pretty thorough job.
The only sites which have not been
attacked are on Calder Two,
Yadalla Prime, and Draken Four.
Yadalla and Draken are on the far
edge of the sector... but Calder
Two is less than a day from here
at maxiumum warp.
That would be their next likely
target.
According to this, there's a
Federation outpost on Calder Two.
But it is only a small science
station; it has limited defensive
capabilities.
I do not believe it could
withstand an attack by the
mercenary ship.
Mister Worf. Send a message to
the Federation outpost on Calder
Two. Advise them that if a ship
matching the mercenary vessel's
configuration approaches, they
should attempt to delay them until
our arrival.
Ensign Giusti, take us out of
orbit. Set course for the Calder
system. Warp nine.
Aye, sir.
We don't have much time...
I hardly expected to see you here,
Wil.
I was trying to find the people
who killed you.
A witness in that bar saw you
vaporized.
These mercenaries use weapons
which activate their Transporter.
It allows them to beam away
objects quickly, by simply firing
at them. That's what they did to
me.
I don't understand any of this.
Who are these people? How did you
get involved with them?
One of the sites I wanted to study
had been raided. A lot of
artifacts were stolen... the site
was practically destroyed. I
wanted to find who was
responsible.
I tracked them to the bar on
Dessica Two. I suppose I asked
too many questions... They
captured me to find out how much
I knew about their operation...
But you ended up as part of the
crew...
I convinced them I was a smuggler
named "Galen", and I offered to
help them appraise the relics
they'd stolen...
Wil, these aren't common thieves.
They're stealing Romulan artifacts
from archaeological sites
throughout this sector...
Baran has me analyzing each one
for a particular particle
signature. They're looking for a
specific artifact...
Why?
That's what we have to find out.
And Baran is the key. I believe
he's the only one on board who
really knows what we're looking
for.
I want you to try to get close to
Baran... gain his confidence.
That's why you set up the engine
failure... you knew I'd be able to
fix it...
He also believes you're a less
than perfect Starfleet officer...
you'll have to play into that
role.
Baran doesn't care much for me --
he tolerates me because he needs
me to test the artifacts. If you
and I become enemies, there's a
better chance you can become his
friend.
All right. I'll do what I can --
What are you doing here?
Getting some answers. Just
because you couldn't get him to
talk --
No one conducts an interrogation
on this ship without my
permission.
Is that understood?
Our next objective is located in
the Sakethan burial mounds on
Calder Two.
Calder Two isn't just another
archaeological site. There's a
Federation outpost there.
I don't see that as a problem.
It's defended by Starfleet.
They're not going to just stand by
while we walk in and take whatever
we want.
I'm aware of the tactical
situation.
What are their defenses?
Nothing to worry about. They have
a type-four deflector shield
protecting the outpost and the
ruins.
They'll also have a minimum of two
phaser banks... and possibly even
photon torpedoes. Is that enough
to worry about?
How do you know so much about this
outpost?
I tried to smuggle a Sakethan
glyph stone out of there two years
ago. I barely got away in one
piece.
Our weapons are more than a match
for their defenses. I anticipate
we'll be able to destroy the
outpost in less than fifteen
minutes. After that, we'll send
in Tallera and the landing party
to secure the relics.
Fifteen minutes is more than
enough time to transmit a distress
call.
By the time they're able to detect
us, we'll be jamming their
communications. They'll have no
chance to send a message.
But our sensors will be useless as
well.
Starfleet's already searching for
this ship. They could be on top
of us without our realizing it.
He's right. And our landing party
would be stranded on the surface.
That's a risk I'm prepared to
take.
That's because you won't be down
there... your life won't be at
risk.
If we don't find what we're
looking for, none of our lives
will be worth anything.
Why? Who are we working for?
All you need to know is that we
have to attack that outpost. We
don't have a choice.
Maybe we do.
Why don't we use Riker?
A Starfleet Commander might be
able to talk us past the outpost
security without raising any
suspicions.
Once they drop their shields, we
could beam the artifacts up
without having to leave the ship.
Why would Riker help us? Just
because he's out of favor with
Starfleet doesn't mean he's ready
to betray them.
If he doesn't help us, we'll
destroy the outpost and kill
everyone on it. He's still a
Starfleet officer... he won't let
innocent people die if he can
prevent it.
The last time we engaged
Starfleet, we lost a man. We
can't afford any more casualties.
If we can avoid a battle, I think
we should.
All right. We'll try it.
We'll be at Calder Two in
approximately five hours... you
all know your duties. I want this
ship ready for battle...
... in case your plan doesn't work.
Computer. Access spectral
enhancement mode three and begin
scan.
Scan complete.
Analysis?
Terikon particle decay profile
does not fall within specified
reference range. Probability of
match: zero-point-zero-four
percent.
Computer. Reset diagnostic for
new sample, lot number three-six-nine-A...
Baran wants to see the analysis of
the last lot. He thinks you're
moving a little slowly.
Tell Baran if he wants the
analysis done faster, he can do it
himself. If he wants it done
correctly, he can wait.
Do you enjoy living dangerously,
Galen? Baran can kill you in an
instant if he activates his
control device...
I doubt he'll do that. I've
increased the accuracy of the
identification process by a factor
of ten. I'm the best person here
to analyze these artifacts, and
Baran knows it.
Computer, begin scan.
He may need you now -- but I know
Baran, and I can tell you he's not
going to back down forever.
You accomplish nothing by
provoking him.
Scan complete.
I don't like operating in the
dark. If I knew what the point of
this mission were... why I'm
scanning these relics...
If Baran felt it were wise to let
the crew know that, I'm sure he
would have.
Do you know what this is all
about?
What Baran knows, I know...
Then tell me what we're doing
here. Why are we risking our
lives taking these artifacts? Who
wants them?
I see no reason to tell you
anything... but you can rest
assured I don't necessarily share
everything I know with Baran,
either.
This conversation, for example...
will stay between us.
You can tell him every word I've
said. He knows I don't think he's
much of a leader.
He's been in charge of this crew
for a long time.
He wouldn't be captain for five
minutes if he didn't have the
control device.
The crew follows him because they
have no choice. Baran's power is
based only on fear and
intimidation.
That almost sounds like a prelude
to mutiny...
If someone were to challenge Baran --
the crew would follow.
I was right. You do like living
dangerously...
I like you, Galen. I can tolerate
a lot from someone like you... but
only to a point.
I intend to complete this mission
successfully and get what's been
promised me. If it looks as
though you're getting in the way
of that... I'll deal with you
myself.
Commander, no one is allowed on
the surface without prior
authorization from the Federation
Science Council.
I'm aware of that, Lieutenant, but
the outpost is in imminent danger
of attack. I want to station
security personnel on the surface
to protect you.
I am ordering you to drop your
shields.
I'm sorry, sir... but the
regulations are very specific. I
can't do it.
If you like, you can remain in
orbit until we contact the Science
Council, but we're experiencing
some communication difficulties
right now, so it might take some
time --
They're delaying on purpose.
Someone has warned them.
Charge main disruptor array...
destroy the outpost.
That would take too long.
Starfleet might be here any
minute...
What are you doing?
I'm configuring the disruptors to
fire a phase-resonant pulse... If
I can hit their shield generator
at precisely the right frequency,
I should be able to knock it off-line
with a single shot...
Firing...
Their shields are down...
The artifacts should be located in
several small structures...
arranged in staggered
formations...
I'm scanning...
I think I've found them.
Lock the coordinates and start
bringing them up.
There should be at least two more
pieces down there.
I've got them --
I've lost transporter lock.
They've managed to get their
shields back up.
I need those artifacts. Lock all
disruptors on target... this time
I want that outpost destroyed.
Direct hit on their aft deflector,
sir... They are undamaged.
Ensign, scan for Starfleet
combadge signals. Is Commander
Riker aboard that ship?
I can't tell, sir. Sensors are
unable to penetrate their hull.
Open a channel.
This is the Federation Starship
Enterprise. You are ordered to
stand down...
... Drop your shields and prepare
to be boarded.
You sent them a message... you
told them where to find us.
That's ridiculous... when did I
have the chance?
This is set to kill.
Order your ship to disengage.
Activate visual.
Commander. Are you all right?
Tell them!
Withdraw the Enterprise, Mister
Data. That's an order.
Sir, that is impossible. The ship
you are on has violated a
Federation outpost. It is my duty
to stop it.
I'm your commanding officer and
I'm giving you a direct order.
Understood?
Commander, if you could explain --
I've never explained my orders to
you before and I'm not going to
start now.
I have no intention of letting
them blow us into space.
If I can set up a low energy com
link between the ships... I can
use my personal command codes to
deactivate their shields.
Do it.
Counselor, could Commander Riker
have been drugged or mentally
altered in some way to explain
this?
I didn't sense anything which
would indicate that...
Commander, we are receiving some
kind of signal from the mercenary
ship...
These are Commander Riker's access
codes... he is attempting to shut
down our shields...
That doesn't make any sense. He
knows those codes would have been
changed as soon as he was
captured...
That is correct, Counselor. He
does know.
Mister Worf. Prepare to drop the
shields.
Sir? We will be totally
defenseless.
I am aware of that.
The moment they see our --
That is an order.
Aye-aye, sir.
It worked! Their shields are
dropping...
Fire!
