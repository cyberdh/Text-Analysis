-- as time passes, a boy
inevitably becomes a man. What is
not inevitable, is that a man
become a warrior. A warrior must
be forged like a sword, tempered
by...
-- by experience. The path of the
warrior begins --
Alexander --
Come in.
No, wait --
Sorry. I didn't mean to hit you.
What is the meaning of this?
I'm sorry. We made Fullerenes in
chemistry class and filled them
with water --
I asked you to meet me here after
school. I have been waiting for
you.
I forgot.
You forgot because you allowed
yourself to be distracted by
foolishness.
I'm sorry.
There is something important I
want to discuss with you.
As time passes, a boy inevitably
becomes a man. What is not
inevitable, is that a man become
a sword --
What?
I meant warrior...
The path of the warrior begins
with the First Rite of Ascension.
Is that where they hit you with
pain sticks?
No, that is the Second Rite.
Oh...
You are approaching the age of
ascension... it is time for you to
prepare for the ceremony.
What do I have to do?
Your fighting skills will be
tested... and your knowledge of
the teachings of Kahless. It is
very challenging, but I will help
you prepare.
This is a kor'tova candle... it
represents the fire that burns in
a warrior's heart.
When you light yours, you will be
declaring your intention to become
a warrior.
Go ahead.
What if... I don't want to?
If you do not participate in the
rite before you are thirteen years
of age, you will never be able to
become a true Klingon warrior.
I don't care about that...
You may not care now, but someday
you might.
Mother always said that I didn't
have to do any of this Klingon
stuff if I didn't want to.
It is your decision... but --
Good, then I'm not going to do it.
Alexander --
You just said it was up to me.
And I don't want to be a warrior.
As a result, the Kearsarge won't
be able to rendezvous with us for
another four days.
Will we be holding position here
until it arrives?
Yes. And, as it looks as though
we'll have a few days of relative
quiet, I'm going to take advantage
of the time by visiting the
Hatarian System. There are
ancient ruins there just being
excavated.
The delay will also make it
possible for Stellar Dynamics to
complete their study of the Vodrey
Nebula.
I'll let them know they can have
more access to the lateral sensor
grid.
This might be a good time to
recalibrate the weapon targeting
array.
Mister Worf?
Yes, sir. I will begin the
procedure immediately.
Very good.
Dismissed.
Lieutenant... could I have a word
with you?
Several times during the briefing
you seemed a bit... distracted.
I apologize. In the future, I
will make sure my personal affairs
do not interfere with my duties.
Is everything all right?
I... am having problems with
Alexander. He has made it clear
that he does not wish to
participate in the First Rite of
Ascension.
I see...
I have tried to tell him that it
is an important part of a young
Klington's life, but he does not
understand...
He's had so little opportunity to
spend time among Klingons... I
doubt if he fully appreciates what
a rich cultural heritage he comes
from.
The festival of Kot'baval begins
tomorrow. If he could take part
in it, he would see that there is
much more to Klingon life than
what I have been able to show
him... if only we were nearer the
homeworld.
What about the Klingon outpost on
Maranga Four... I'm sure they'll
celebrate the festival there.
Yes... but the outpost is on the
far side of the Vodrey Nebula, it
is three days away by shuttle...
The Enterprise could be there in
a fraction of that time, and still
be back here for our rendezvous.
Sir, I could not ask you to --
I'm willing to bet Stellar
Dynamics would like nothing better
than to make a trip around the
Nebula; it'll give them the chance
to study it that much more
thoroughly.
Bok'ta ku'mo. (over here)
Who's that?
That is the tyrant Molor. He was
so strong that no one could stand
against him.
Nok'tar be'got, hosh'ar te'not... ?
What's he saying?
He is asking if anyone else will
have the courage to stand up to
Molor...
Nok'tar be'got... ?
Ki'rok Molor, ki'rok!
Ni'tokor bak'to!
Ba'jak tu'mo!
O'tak tu'ro!
Nok'tar be'got?
Hosh'ar te'not?
Ki'rok Molor, ki'rok!
What's this... ?
Jik'ta! You have wounded me!
You fought well.
What happens now?
Only one man can stand against
Molor.
It's Kahless!
Nok'til Kahless. Molor gik'tal!
Kahless would rather die than live
under Molor's tyranny...
Ni'lot Kahless!
Father --
Where have you been?
We were watching the fire dancers.
We?
K'Nor and Bar'el -- they live here
on the outpost. I need some
money.
What for?
There's a man over there who's got
Molor's head in a box -- the real
Molor.
That is impossible. Molor died
centuries ago.
I know -- it's mummified. He said
he'd show it to us for fifty
darseks.
He is trying to take your money.
Please, Father. He's waiting.
No. It is late. We should go
home.
But --
Alexander.
Come, it is time to go.
I have to say goodbye.
You can see your friends again
tomorrow.
We're coming back?
If you want to.
Alexander, run --
Ni'tokor bak'to!
K'pla, Worf. They were no match
for us.
I've seen you somewhere before.
Who are you?
A friend...
Are you... K'mtar?
Your brother sent me here to
protect you...
He is gin'tak to the house of
Mogh...
Gin'tak?
An advisor so trusted that he is
made part of a family.
Do you have any idea who was
behind the attack?
It is a Klingon matter. Not your
concern.
One of my officers was almost
killed. That makes it my concern.
Recently rumors began to circulate
on the homeworld that an
assassination attempt was going to
be made against the family of
Mogh. Kurn sent me to make sure
nothing happened to Worf.
Why didn't you warn him before the
attack was made?
I tried to contact him by
subspace, but was told Worf wasn't
aboard. I decided to beam
directly to the surface.
One of the attackers dropped this
dagger.
The design... represents the house
of Duras.
We have other evidence that
indicates the Duras sisters, Lursa
and B'Etor, were behind the
attack.
What do you think they're after?
Kurn's seat on the council, of
course.
We can not allow their attack on
our house to go unanswered.
First we have to find them... and
they've been elusive.
At one point they were at Deep
Space Nine, trying to sell
bilitrium explosives.
That was months ago. No one knows
where they went from there.
Maybe we can find out.
We've arranged quarters for you,
if you'd like to stay aboard.
I would. Worf and I have much to
discuss.
I'll send Kurn a message telling
him what happened, but it will be
days before he receives it -- he's
gone to the Hitora colony as
Gowron's representative.
K'mtar, why did you treat
Commander Riker so
disrespectfully?
You were... rude.
I may have been rude by human
standards, but I meant no
disrespect.
What's the matter Worf, have you
been living among humans so long
that you've forgotten how Klingons
behave?
I have not forgotten... I am
merely pointing out that their
ways our different from ours.
I trust you've made your son aware
of that fact, as well?
Of course I have.
Good. Because someday Alexander
may be called upon to lead the
house of Mogh. Kurn has no male
heir, and he wants to be sure that
Alexander is preparing himself.
Does my brother doubt my ability
to raise my son as a Klingon?
No. But you are alone among
humans. It cannot be easy to keep
our ways.
No... it has not been easy.
How are his fighting skills? Can
he handle a Bat'leth?
He is learning... he could be
better.
He must be. He's not far from the
age of ascension.
Actually... Alexander has not
committed himself to undergoing
the rite.
What?
I have tried to make him see how
important it is, but he will not
listen to me.
Perhaps together, you and I can
find a way to spark the boy's
interest in his heritage.
I would be grateful for any help
you could give.
Tomorrow, then.
May I say goodnight to him?
Of course.
Is this your mother?
She died when I was little.
You miss her a great deal, don't
you... ?
It must be hard for you... being
the only Klingon your age on board
this ship.
Sometimes...
Have you ever been to the
homeworld?
No...
I think you'd like it there. At
your uncle's house there is a lake
where you can swim. The water is
so clear you can see to the
bottom.
Really?
And you have cousins there. They
want to meet you.
I don't know...
I understand. You're afraid...
you don't know if the Home World
is safe.
Yes...
What happened today... on the
planet... was frightening.
You're still troubled...
I thought they were going to kill
my father.
You must have wanted to help us
fight them off.
I didn't know what to do...
Someday, if you work hard, you'll
be a warrior... a Klingon warrior,
and you'll always feel safe
because you'll know how to defend
yourself. And do you know what
else? If anyone ever tries to
hurt your father again, you'll be
able to fight at his side and make
sure nothing happens to him. What
do you think of that?
Good night, Alexander. Dream
well.
Good night, K'mtar.
Any luck?
Starfleet records contain no
mention of the Duras sisters after
their departure from Deep Space
Nine.
Didn't I tell you as much?
Have you been able to make contact
with Deep Space Nine?
I am being patched through now,
sir...
On screen.
Quark...
I see you remember me.
How could I forget the only man
ever to win triple down dabo at
one of my tables... ?
And how could I forget that you
didn't have enough latinum to
cover my winnings?
I thought I explained that my
brother had misplaced the key to
the safe. Besides, those vouchers
I gave you are every bit as good
as latinum.
Not exactly. You can spend
latinum just about anywhere.
Those vouchers are only good at
your bar.
I look forward to seeing you upon
your return...
Is that what this is about...
you're on your way and you're
calling to reserve a Holosuite
program... ?
Actually, I was hoping you could
help me with something else.
What would that be... ?
I'm looking for some Klingon
friends of mine... the Duras
sisters -- Lursa and B'Etor?
Oh, yes... Lursa and B'Etor...
Big talk... small tips.
I thought you might know where
they went.
Me? What makes you think I'd
know... ?
Commander Sisko said if anyone
would know, you would...
He flatters me.
Well... I did hear a rumor,
actually...
What kind of rumor?
I don't know... I'm sure it was
told to me in confidence...
And how much is your "confidence"
worth?
How many vouchers do you have,
again?
Enough for twelve bars of latinum.
I'll be glad to return them.
Ah. I believe the rumor was...
that the sisters were trying to
buy some second-hand mining
equipment.
What for?
They learned of a magnesite
deposit in the Kalla system... it
belongs to the Pakleds, but those
fools don't even know it's there.
Your friends were trying to get at
it.
All right.
I'll send you those vouchers...
Don't bother... I voided them
while we've been talking.
So long, Quark...
How long would it take us to reach
the Kalla system?
Approximately sixteen hours.
Couldn't he have been lying?
Why would he? I'd just end up
knocking on his door again in a
few days -- and I wouldn't be in
as good a mood.
I congratulate you, Commander. I
didn't think it would be possible
to find the sisters.
Take us out of orbit.
Today we will work on the
Koh'manara block... it is a
combination of the koh'bala pivot
and the pak'ara thrust -- the
forms I taught you last week.
Yes, Father...
Alexander, have I not taught you
to treat your sword with respect?
You're not looking forward to
training, are you?
Not really...
It can be boring repeating the
same moves over and over again.
You must master the forms before
you can apply them.
That's true, but I was thinking we
might try something different
today.
I took the liberty of creating a
Holodeck program.
What kind of program?
I'll show you...
Computer... run program K'mtar
alpha-one.
Program initiated. Enter when
ready.
Why did you want to recreate this?
You said you wished you'd been
able to help your father fight,
but you didn't know how...
You've probably thought about the
attack over and over again.
Yes...
Then let's see what happens this
time.
Computer, give us two Klingon
warriors.
How can I fight somebody that big?
It is not size that matters.
Cunning... skill... and
observation are the most important
weapons.
Ni'tokor bak'to!
Freeze program.
Look what this ko'tal is doing.
See his legs, they give a clue to
what his next move will be.
His weight is all on his right
foot.
Yes, he's going to have to shift
it to regain his balance.
Stand ready.
Computer, resume program.
Po'tajg! (well done)
Finish him.
Freeze program.
You should have killed him when
you had the chance.
Why didn't you?
I... I don't know...
Look at him! He didn't care that
you showed him mercy. He was
going to kill you.
K'mtar... enough.
If this were real he'd be dead
now.
Alexander --
We are approaching Kalla Three.
Assume a standard orbit.
Any evidence of a mining
operation?
A shaft has been cut through the
outer crust... there is evidence
of machinery, but it does not
appear to be in use.
Life signs?
It is difficult to say. The
magnesite is interfering with bioreadings.
Assemble an Away Team.
Who are you?
Gorta... I'm Gorta...
What are you doing on this planet?
I... crashed here.
Then you are denying involvement
in illegal mining activities.
Mining? So that's what all this
equipment is for...
I suspect that you are feigning
ignorance.
What a thing to say.
We are looking for two Klingon
women, sisters --
Lursa! B'Etor? Do you know where
they are?
Actually we were hoping you did.
Maybe I do...
Would you be willing to share your
information with us?
My personal code of conduct
prohibits sharing. But I'd
consider a trade...
Does your personal code of conduct
tell you that when you're stranded
on a planet with no way off, you
shouldn't try to cut deals?
You have a point.
We could certainly provide you
with passage off this planet in
exchange for information.
Could you perhaps... fail to tell
the Pakleds that we were mining
their ore?
Don't push your luck.
But if you can get us to the Duras
sisters, I'll see what I can do.
The Duras sisters... they are
magnificent, aren't they?
Where are they now?
Selling the ore, I imagine. They
took everything, the ore, the
ship...
Such treachery... I can't help but
adore them.
What kind of ship do they have?
A Bird of Prey. With a working
cloaking device. Who knows how
they got hold of that...
And where have they gone?
We were going to sell the ore to
a Yridian trader. We were
supposed to meet him in the Ufandi
system.
Gather your belongings. It is
time to leave.
Like I said... they took
everything.
Worf...
I'm sorry about what happened. I
shouldn't have gotten so angry.
It's just that... I'm worried
about Alexander.
As am I.
Kurn told me that his mother
actively discouraged him from
exploring his Klingon heritage...
When he came to live with me, he
knew nothing of our ways.
He often reminds me of things his
mother said to him... I try not to
disregard her wishes, I want him
to honor her memory...
Someday... I'm sure he'll
appreciate you. And be grateful
for all you've given him.
Still, compared to other boys his
age, Alexander's fighting skills
are years behind.
I know. He has not put in the
time he needs to learn the skills.
I think you should consider
sending him to the training
Academy on Ogat. Your brother is
an influential man; he could see
to it that Alexander was admitted.
Send him... to Ogat?
I'm only thinking of what's best
for him. At the Academy he'd
learn our ways, he'd live like a
Klingon.
I want him to learn our ways,
but... this is his home.
How can you expect him to lead our
house someday when all he's known
is life aboard a Federation
starship?
He is my son; he belongs with me.
The boy is more human than
Klingon. If he stays here, he'll
never be a warrior. He'll never
be able to defend our family
against its enemies.
Enough... the decision is mine.
Not necessarily. It would be
within my rights to invoke ya'nora
kor.
You would challenge my fitness to
raise my own son?
For the good of our house, yes.
Worf... I beg you... stop thinking
of yourself. It's Alexander we
must consider.
Look into your heart... and do
what's best for him.
-- if K'mtar invoked ya'nora kor,
your vote would cancel his, and it
would be up to your brother to
decide who would get custody of
Alexander.
I am confident my brother would
not vote against me.
You don't sound confident...
Perhaps I should let Alexander
know what is at stake... it might
induce him to spend more time
training.
I'm not sure that's a good idea...
it might scare him.
I should have tried harder... I
should have taken him to visit the
homeworld...
Worf... Alexander is part human,
and that part of him is every bit
as important as his Klingon side.
I think you've done a wonderful
job of exposing him to both sides
of his heritage.
But by doing that, I may have made
it impossible for him to be
accepted as a true Klingon.
There are those who'd say you're
not a true Klingon, just because
you wear that uniform.
The truth is you've found a
balance within yourself, a balance
that feels right to you. You have
to trust that Alexander will be
able to find his own balance.
Just as you did.
Part of me wants to give him that
freedom... but what if he turns
away from his Klingon heritage?
What will happen to my father's
house? Who will lead it?
-- Kahless was determined to teach
his brother a lesson for having
told a lie, but Morath refused to
fight his brother, and instead ran
away. Kahless pursued him across
valleys and over mountains, all
the way to the edge of the sea.
And there on the shore, they
fought for --
Twelve days and twelve nights. I
know, I've heard this story
before.
Alexander, it is important to tell
these stories, even if we already
know them.
Why was Kahless so mad about the
lie his brother told?
Because it made him look like a
coward.
If Kahless had just let him
explain what happened, maybe they
wouldn't have had to fight about
it.
You are missing the point --
And I don't see what's so wrong
with running away -- maybe Morath
didn't want to fight his brother
because he didn't want to have to
kill him.
He ran because he was a coward --
How do you know that's why?
No more questions! These are our
stories. A warrior must learn how
to interpret them properly.
I'm trying to --
No, your head is full of foolish
human notions about the way things
are. You are Klingon. You must
begin to act like one.
I'm part human, too.
Listen to me, Alexander... when a
human looks at you, he doesn't see
himself, he sees a Klingon.
It doesn't matter what I look
like.
It does. You're different from
everyone aboard this ship. And no
matter how much people pretend
otherwise, they'll always see you
as different.
That's not true...
It is. The only way you'll ever
feel like you really belong, is if
you leave here and go live with
your own kind.
I know a Klingon school you could
go to; you'd be welcome there.
They'd teach you how to be a
warrior -- prepare you for the
Rite of Ascension.
I don't know if I want to do
that...
After you've been there a while...
you'll find you won't want to do
anything else.
But I don't want to leave the
Enterprise --
You must! Everything depends on
it.
I thought you were different. I
thought you understood me. But
you don't. You're just like my
Father. All you care about is me
becoming a warrior. Why don't you
just leave me alone!
First Officer's Log, stardate
47779.4. We've entered the Ufandi
system, where we believe the Duras
sisters might have come to sell
the ore they mined on Kalla Three.
I am detecting a vessel holding
position near the third planet...
It is a Yridian freighter.
Put it on screen.
Scan for magnesite in its hold.
The resonance signature indicates
that there is magnesite ore
present...
Then we're too late. The sisters
have already been here.
Somehow I doubt the Yridians are
going to be very forthcoming about
where they might have gone...
Sir, readings indicate that there
are only five hundred kilograms of
ore in the Yridian's hold...
There should be over ten thousand
kilograms...
That's odd...
Hail them.
I'm Commander Riker of the
Federation Starship Enterprise.
I am Yog... why are we speaking?
Our sensors indicate you're
carrying magnesite ore...
Magnesite, yes.
Where did you get it?
From a Corvallen. For a good
price.
Where's this... Corvallen now? I
have orders to acquire some
magnesite.
He is gone...
Where? I don't know.
Wouldn't you be interested in
selling me the ore you're
carrying?
No, I have a buyer.
You haven't heard my offer.
Half a gram of Anjoran bio-mimetic
gel.
Done.
Once we've verified the ore's
purity, we'll beam over the gel.
You're up to something...
Have the Transporter Room beam the
ore to these coordinates.
Sir, that would place the ore
directly off the ship's starboard
bow.
I know.
Transport complete.
Lock phasers on the ore and fire.
Firing.
A Bird of Prey...
Put a tractor beam on it.
How did you know?
The Yridians had only part of the
shipment in their hold -- I
realized we must've arrived before
they had the chance to transfer
the rest.
Sir, the Klingon ship is hailing
us.
On screen.
Release our vessel at once!
I don't think so.
We've done nothing wrong. We were
engaging in a simple business
transaction.
We know you're dealing in stolen
ore.
But what I really want to talk
about is the assassination attempt
on Lieutenant Worf.
What assassination attempt? This
is the first I've heard of it.
Did it succeed?
We have evidence that you were
behind it.
That is outrageous.
What is this evidence?
Beam over and we'll show you.
We will be there shortly.
This was dropped by one of the
assassins...
It bears the crest of your house.
Ge'ko... kaf'la. (It's true. How
can this be?)
Someone must have given it to the
assassins -- to implicate us.
Why would someone do that?
In order to tarnish our good name.
You can't tarnish a rusted
blade...
Ji'ko to'val!
Gir'nak tovo'sor!
Mister Worf --
You said you had other evidence
they were involved.
Yes... on the homeworld.
Then we'll set a course there. I
want this cleared up.
I will send a message to Kurn...
he may wish to return to the
homeworld as well.
Bet'ala nog'tor. (look at this)
Impossible...
What is it?
These markings represent the
members of our house...
This symbol represents our
father...
Myself, my sister... and this...
represents her son.
I was not aware you had a son.
I do not... But I am with child...
She found out only a few days
ago... and she's told no one but
me.
How can this marking be here?
Where did this come from... ?
I will talk to K'mtar.
No further.
K'mtar... why are you doing this?
Step away from the door.
You will have to kill me.
I won't do that. But I can stun
you -- then kill the boy.
What?
I... am Alexander.
What... are you saying?
I... am your son... Alexander...
I have come to this time from
forty years in the future.
P'tak! Tell me the truth or I
will kill you.
Look at me!
You said when you first met me
that I looked familiar.
I could have seen you on the
Homeworld...
No. Look closely. I am your son.
If you are Alexander... you will
remember the final words your
mother said as she died.
I was three years old. She was
dying when we found her. She
barely managed to whisper my
name... and she took my hand...
and placed it in yours.
Then she died. You howled with
rage... and then you told me to
look at her... to look at death...
and always to remember.
And I always have.
How... have you done this? Come
to this time?
Forty years from now the ways are
well known. But few are willing
to risk the dangers.
I decided I must take the risk.
And you did it... in order to end
your own life?
I was hoping I wouldn't have to...
that I could change things, change
myself. But I couldn't.
Everything's going to turn out the
way it did before. And I can't
let that happen.
Why? What is going to happen that
is so terrible?
You will be killed. Because I was
naive... too weak... to be able to
protect you.
I don't believe that...
I was there! I saw you
murdered... and I was to blame.
You mustn't blame yourself.
You don't understand -- I never
became a warrior! I became a
diplomat... a "peacemaker."
When the time came for me to lead
our family -- I thought I could
single-handedly put an end to the
fighting between the great
houses... I declared publicly
that the house of Mogh would take
the first step to end the feuding.
There would be no more
retribution, no more revenge.
You tried to warn me... you tried
to tell me that I mustn't show
weakness... but I thought you
were a foolish old man. I told
you that you were a relic of an
earlier time, and that a new era
of peace was at hand.
But you were right. My enemies
saw my weakness... and they moved
against me.
Unless I stop it all now...
-- that boy will see his father
killed on the floor of the Council
Chamber.
That's why you wanted to take
Alexander away. To turn him into
a warrior, not a peacemaker.
I staged the assassination attempt
to frighten him... make him
realize he must learn the ways of
a warrior.
If I had listened to you... if I
had become the warrior you
wanted... you would not have died
in my arms.
Who is to say what the future will
be now, after you have disrupted
time? I may die tomorrow... or I
may outlive you.
But when I die... I would like an
honorable death. And the only way
that is possible -- is for you
accept yourself, as you are, and
stay true to what you believe.
The cause of peace is a worthy
one... go back, and continue to
work for it. Your struggle must
continue.
But it is a futile struggle...
No... you've already changed
things more than you realize.
The boy I was has not changed...
I'm talking about myself.
You have given me a glimpse into
my son's future. I see now that
he has his own destiny... and I
believe it will be a great one...
I love you, Father...
And I you, Alexander...
I've been waiting -- where's
K'mtar?
He had to leave... he was called
away...
He never said goodbye.
He asked me to say goodbye for
him.
He wanted me to tell you that no
matter what happens, no matter
what you decide to do with your
life, he'll always care about you
a great deal.
When will I see him again?
It may be a long time...
We should start practice...
Alexander... there will be plenty
of time for training. Why don't
we... just spend some time
together?
