Data, there you are... we need to
install that plasma conduit right
away. We're bringing the new warp
core on-line in less than three
hours.
I will go to deck twenty and begin
modifications.
Great. Meet me in Engineering as
soon as you're finished.
This should be a lot of fun.
Excuse me. Do you have
authorization to work in this
area?
You are dismantling a warp plasma
conduit. I must ask you to stop.
Be quiet!
Captain's Log, Stardate 47225.7.
Commander LaForge has completed
the installation of our new warp
core. We are preparing to test
its capabilities.
Something wrong, sir?
I just got a message from
Starfleet command.
Bad news?
You could say that...
I've been invited to the annual
Starfleet Admiral's banquet.
My condolences.
I've managed to avoid it for the
last six years. I guess my luck
just ran out...
I can't imagine anything more
tedious. Fifty Admirals shaking
hands, making dull conversation...
uninteresting food... boring
speeches...
Can't you find an excuse not to
go?
After six years, I don't have any
excuses left. Besides, I've been
invited by Admiral Nakamura, the
Sector Commander. He'd consider
it an insult if I turned him down.
We could cause a diplomatic
crisis. Take the ship into the
neutral zone and attack the
Romulans... that should get you
out of the banquet.
I wouldn't count on it.
Have you ever had nightmares
before?
Sure. Everybody does from time to
time...
I have had one hundred eleven
dreams since I first discovered
the program nine months ago. In
all of that time, I have never
experienced such strange and
disturbing imagery in a dream.
I believe it was... a nightmare.
Nightmares are part of dreaming,
Data. Maybe you just discovered
a new level to your program.
Perhaps. I have also noted that
I am spending an inordinate amount
of time thinking about nightmare
imagery. One could almost say
that I am... preoccupied.
Well, that's perfectly normal.
When I have a nightmare, sometimes
I can't shake that weird feeling
for days...
Commander LaForge!
Speaking of nightmares...
I just finished recalibrating the
starboard EPS module.
That's great. Thank you, Ensign.
It's just like you said -- reset
the power tap... and the module
came right on-line. You have such
a wonderful grasp of engineering
principles. I'm learning so much
just by being around you...
Well. Ah... why don't you go help
Farrel check the deuterium
cartridges. We're about to bring
the warp core on-line.
Anything you say.
Geordi, you do not seem to
appreciate Ensign Tyler's
enthusiasm.
Oh, she's enthusiastic all
right... about me.
I do not understand.
She has a crush on me, Data.
And you do not share her
affection?
Frankly, no. And it's getting a
little awkward...
I believe I understand. You are
concerned about unintentionally
hurting Ensign Tyler's feelings.
Yeah... something like that...
It would appear that you require
a third party to intervene on your
behalf. I would be happy to speak
to her.
No, Data... I'll take care of it
myself. Thanks.
When I first woke up from my
nightmare, there --
Bridge to Commander LaForge.
What's our status?
We're ready to bring the core on-line,
Captain. Stand by.
All right. Let's do it.
Initializing deuterium infusion
sequence...
It's a beauty, isn't it? Now
let's see how fast she can run...
LaForge to Bridge. Warp power at
your discretion, Captain.
Acknowledged.
Ensign Russell, plot a course to
Starbase Two-nineteen. Warp six.
Engage.
Engage...
Bridge to Engineering. Mister La
Forge... why isn't my ship moving?
I'm on it, sir. There's a warp
plasma conduit out of alignment,
but I think I've fixed it...
Ready, sir.
Very well. Ensign Russell?
Mister LaForge?
Stand by, Captain...
I will take the warp engines off-line.
LaForge to Bridge. I'm sorry,
Captain. We're going to have to
reconfigure the plasma conduit.
It's going to take a few hours at
least, sir.
Enter.
Hello, Data...
What are you doing?
I am watching Spot sleep. In the
past fifteen minutes, he has had
twelve muscles spasms, which
indicates that he is dreaming.
I have often wondered what he
dreams about. His twitching and
his rapid breathing would seem to
suggest anxiety -- but Spot has
never seen a mouse or any other
form of rodentia. Nor has he
encountered an insect, or been
chased by a canine.
I understand you've had some
interesting dreams lately...
Geordi was a little worried about
you. He just wanted me to check
in and see how you were doing...
That was very thoughtful of him.
I have been debating whether or
not to initiate another dream
sequence.
Because of the nightmares... ?
I have found them to be quite...
unsettling.
Data, you shouldn't be afraid to
experience dark imagery in your
dreams. It's a natural expression
of your unconscious...
... if you have an unconscious.
I'm not really sure how your
positronic brain works... but if
it's anything like our brains,
then there's part of you that's
trying to express itself through
your dream state. And I think you
should allow yourself to
experience it.
As Sigmund Freud would have
said... "Dreams are the royal
road to the knowledge of the
mind."
Thank you, Counselor. I believe
I will initialize the dream
program now.
Let me know how it goes. Good
night, Data.
Good night, Counselor.
Good night, Spot.
Computer -- dim lights.
Mmm. It is delicious.
What kind of cake are you eating?
It is cellular peptide cake...
with mint frosting. Would you
like a bite?
No, thank you.
Excuse me, Mister Worf.
Aren't you going to answer that,
Mister Data?
Sir?
That damn ringing. Answer it,
will you?
Yes sir.
Please identify yourselves.
I must know what you are trying to --
Be quiet!
Counselor...
Data, please... don't hurt me..
I am sorry, Counselor.
No...
Data, no! DATA!
Data!
What is wrong?
We've been trying to wake you up
for the past five minutes.
When you didn't show up in
Engineering on time, I got
worried... I called security...
My internal chronometer was
supposed to wake me thirty-five
minutes ago.
You must have... overslept.
That is not possible...
Something is wrong.
I can't find anything wrong with
your internal time-base... and as
far as I can tell, your primary
systems check out fine.
My chronometer is functioning
normally, as well.
I will compare my autonomic logs
to the ship's chronometer.
Perhaps we overlooked something.
You know, Data... there's a lot we
don't know about your dream
program. Maybe it was designed to
cause some side-effects...
For all we know, Doctor Soong
intended for you to oversleep now
and then... as part of the human
experience.
It is a possibility. However, I
would prefer to make certain there
are no anomalies in my neural net.
I'm curious... what were you
dreaming about when we woke you
up?
I have not fully assimilated its
impact. I would prefer to study
the images further before
discussing them.
Sure... I understand.
Sounds like it must've been pretty
strange...
"Strange" is not a sufficient
adjective to describe the
experience.
Tell me more about this... "cake."
It is difficult to explain.
Counselor Troi's body was -- a
cake.
Her upper-body...
Describe the knife you used to...
"cut" the Counselor.
It had a black handle and a
serrated blade. And it was quite
long.
How long?
Approximately twenty-five
centimeters in length.
What happened next?
One of the workmen pointed to her
right shoulder. At that moment,
I felt an overwhelming urge to cut
a piece out of the cake.
And did you... ?
Yes. As I began to slice the
cake, she reacted as though I was
causing her pain. And yet, I
could not stop cutting.
It was then that I woke up.
Mmm...
I am curious, Doctor Freud... what
do my nightmares mean?
I believe you are experiencing a
classic dismemberment dream.
Or in your case... being a
mechanical man... a dismantlement
dream.
I do not understand.
Your mechanistic qualities are
trying to reassert themselves over
your human tendencies. Ego and id
are struggling for domination.
The "workmen" symbolize the ever-present
id constantly working to
destroy the ego.
The image of Counselor Troi, a
female, is devoured by you...
clearly indicating an unconscious
desire to possess your own mother.
But I do not have a mother.
Do not interrupt. The knife and
its violent connotation suggests
a certain feeling of sexual
inadequacy...
I have no sexual desires.
Ach! Repression on top of
everything. It is all becoming
clear to me now...
There might be a paper in this...
I could call it "Mister D: An
Analysis of Android Dementia."
I do not believe I am being helped
by this session.
Classic transference! Your anger
toward me is, in fact, the
animosity you feel toward your
father.
You are a polymorphously-perverse
individual, Mister Data, and I
recommend full psychoanalysis.
I believe I can fit you in... next
Tuesday.
That will not be necessary.
Computer -- end program.
Captain. Incoming message from
Admiral Nakamura.
On screen.
Admiral.
Captain, we were expecting you
this morning. Is there a problem?
Actually, we've been experiencing
a few minor difficulties with our
new warp core. But my Chief
Engineer assures me that we'll be
under way within the hour.
I was hoping we'd have a chance to
discuss your new mission orders
before the banquet... but I guess
it'll have to wait.
My apologies, Admiral.
You're not trying to... avoid this
particular engagement, are you,
Captain?
Oh, no... certainly not, sir. I'm
looking forward to it.
Good. I'll expect you soon.
Nakamura out.
I think he's on to you, sir.
LaForge to Bridge.
Go ahead, Geordi.
We've just started her up, sir.
All systems are holding steady...
Ready when you are, Captain.
Ensign Russell -- set course and
engage.
Engineering -- report!
The warp field has collapsed, sir.
It looks like we've blown out the
entire power converter, Captain.
Impulse engines are down, too --
we're not going anywhere...
But I know exactly how to fix it.
Give me two, three hours, tops.
Now what?
Talk about going nowhere fast.
Mister Worf, open a channel to
Starbase Two-nineteen. Advise
Admiral Nakamura... I'll be later
than I thought.
Tyler, how are you coming with
that relay diagnostic?
Almost done, sir...
If you'll excuse me, I need this
plasma inverter...
Ensign Tyler still appears to have
a "crush" on you, Geordi. It is
clear that you did not speak with
her.
I haven't had a chance, Data...
Here. Give me a hand with this
coil brace.
Could you perform a metallurgical
scan on the brace... see if there
are any microfractures? Be
careful, it's kind of sharp.
Is there a problem, Data?
I am reminded of a recent dream.
This brace is reminiscent of...
Aren't you going to answer that,
Commander?
What are you waiting for? Answer
it!
Hello?
Kill them. You must kill them
all... before it's too late.
Data.
Data, what's wrong?
I do not know.
Everything seems to remind me of
the nightmare -- objects, sounds,
smells. And now I have seen
elements from the dream while
still in a waking state.
I cannot explain it.
Data... if you were one of my
human patients, I might be
concerned right now. I'd say you
had a waking dream... or a
hallucination...
But you're not human. It seems to
me that we might be looking at
some sort of technological
problem...
I have run three complete self-diagnostics.
All of my systems
are functioning normally.
I have studied over one hundred
thirty-eight different theories of
dream analysis in an effort to
explain my nightmares.
What have you found?
I have been unable to find a
single interpretation of my
nightmares. For instance, Neo-Platonic
hermetic texts from the
Ancient Near East would suggest
that my experience indicates a
prophetic function -- that I have
perceived an impending disaster.
Professor Syrus of Tilonus Four
would consider my dreams nothing
more than epi-phenomena in my
neural net. Random discharges
with no meaning whatsoever.
Doctor Freud of early Twentieth
century Earth suggested that my
dreams represent a latent psychosexual
complex.
Perhaps Freud was correct... and
the knife I dreamed of is the
embodiment of my unconscious
desire to inflict violence.
Data... even Freud said "sometimes
a cigar is just a cigar."
A lot of the theories you've
examined are interesting... but
they're also flawed and obsolete.
That knife could just as well be
an archetypal symbol of rational
clarity -- it's sharp... it cuts
through things that are dull...
The bottom line is... I think you
may be developing an almost...
obsessive interest in your own
inner-workings.
I'd almost call it the beginnings
of a... neurosis.
That is not possible.
Why not? You've eliminated all
the technical explanations. And
it makes sense that as your neural
net becomes more complex... more
human... you might experience the
same kind of psychological
complexities as a human.
Do you really think it is
possible?
You may be the first person who's
come into my office who's actually
been excited by the prospect of a
new neurosis.
But yes... I do think it's
possible. In fact, I'd like to
start counseling you on a regular
basis.
Daily?
No... we'll start weekly. And as
a first step, I want you to shut
down your dream program until our
next session... just to be safe.
Give yourself a chance to reflect
on this experience.
Thank you, Counselor. I look
forward to our next meeting.
And Data...
Next time... see me before you see
Sigmund.
Admiral, I can explain...
Let me guess. Your new warp core
is... "malfunctioning" again?
Unfortunately, the problem has
affected our impulse systems now.
At the moment, we are... adrift.
Are you expecting to have the
problem fixed soon... or shall we
send out a tow ship to bring you
in?
That won't be necessary. I have
full confidence in my Engineering
staff. I will be at the banquet
on time.
Incidentally, Captain... the
banquet really won't be as bad as
you might expect.
The key note speaker is going to
address Bajoran aqueduct
management. And I hear they're
serving Ktarian spice cake for
dessert this year.
Yes, I know... it sounds...
delightful.
It is not to be missed.
Understood?
Yes, sir. Picard out.

Yes, sir. Picard out.
Have you tried reconfiguring the
plasma conduit?
Yes, sir... we did that two hours
ago.
What about the relays? Have you
made absolutely sure they don't
need a new phase invertor?
I am currently running a level
three diagnostic on the relays,
sir. We will have the results of
the analysis in approximately ten
minutes.
I see...
Perhaps I can help you reconfigure
these isolinear chips...
No, sir, please don't touch that --
Sir... Commander Data and I have
the situation under control. If
you'd just let the two of us take
care of it... we can get the work
done a lot faster...
You're right...
If you don't mind, I'll just wait
here and observe your progress.
Actually, Captain...
Captain. We could use an extra
hand moving the containment
pods...
Not at all. I'd be happy to...
Good work, Ensign. I thought he'd
never leave...
Data, would you help me lock down
this plasma conduit... ?
Data?
Data... ?
Deck Thirty-six.
Hello, Data.
Data... are you all right?
What are you doing?
I am sorry, Counselor.
NO!
Ever since you gave Alexander that
music program... he has been
playing it all night... every
night.
I was just trying to broaden his
horizons. Besides, he likes it.
It is screeching... pounding...
dissonant. It is not music.
Worf, it's better than music --
it's jazz.
Data -- !
Medical emergency, deck seventeen,
section three alpha!
I believe I had another waking
dream, sir. But this time, I felt
an uncontrollable urge to...
eliminate the image I saw.
And what you saw was some sort of
a... "mouth" on Counselor Troi's
shoulder...
Yes, sir. And for a reason I
cannot explain, I felt the need to
destroy it.
What about me? Did you see one of
these mouths on my head?
No, sir. I saw a straw coming out
of your head.
A straw?
As I said, these are all images
that I originally experienced in
my dream program. I do not have
a rational explanation for them.
But you said you shut down your
dream program...
That is correct.
Mister LaForge?
We've run every possible
diagnostic on Data's positronic
net... but we can't find anything
wrong. I can run a sub-polymer
scan... but it'll take some time
to get the equipment together.
Make it so.
In the meantime, Mister Data...
I'm going to have to relieve you
of duty and confine you to
quarters.
A sensible precaution, sir.
It's all right, Deanna... you're
in Sickbay. Everything's going to
be all right.
Data...
He's not here... try to relax.
The vascular pad has healed your
wound. But you've lost a lot of
blood... so I want you to lie
still for a while.
That's odd... there shouldn't be
any discoloration after the
treatment. This looks like some
sort of rash...
What is it?
I'm picking up cellular
degradation. But I don't think
it's related to the lacerations...
And there's some kind of residual
interphasic signature...
Nurse, get me an interphasic
scanner... I want to take a
closer look.
Does that hurt?
Not at all...
I will have to confiscate your
sidearm.
May I ask a personal favor?
Yes?
Will you take care of Spot for me?
Your... animal?
I am concerned that if I have
another waking dream, I may...
injure him.
Of course.
Spot. Come here.
Unlike a canine, Spot will not
respond to verbal commands.
Goodbye, Spot.
He will need to be fed once a day.
He prefers feline supplement one-twenty-five.
I understand.
And he will require water. And
you must also provide him with a
sand box.
And you must talk to him. Tell
him he is a pretty cat, and a good
cat...
I will... feed him.
Perhaps that will be enough.
Captain. We have a problem. Take
a look at this...
Her tissue is breaking down on a
cellular level... and it's
spreading. At first I thought it
was a rash from the coil brace she
was stabbed with... but when I
used the interphasic scanner, I
found something else...
What is it?
The better question is... what are
they?
I've only checked the medical
staff... but I've found them on
almost everyone so far...
The infestation rate has reached
seventy-three percent of the crew
so far. The cellular decay is
accelerating in all cases. I
haven't found a way to stop it...
or even slow it down.
What are we dealing with here?
Are these creatures... feeding off
us?
In a way... They appear to be
extracting our cellular peptides.
It's roughly analogous to the way
Terran leeches consume hemoglobin.
Can we reverse the process?
Not until the organisms are
removed. And if they're not
removed soon, our bodies will
begin to lose all cellular
cohesion... we'll collapse into
nothing but a few pounds of
chemicals.
Can we affect the organisms in any
way?
We've tried E-M radiation...
subspace fields... thermal
protons... nothing works. They
seem to exist in an interphasic
state, just beyond our visual and
sensor acuity. The only way we
can see them is to use an IP
scanner... tricorders can't even
pick them up.
Do we know where these things came
from?
I have scanned the vicinity with
an IP scanner. There is no sign
of any similar creatures, or any
unusual interphasic activity.
Perhaps Starbase Eighty-four...
could we have picked them up there
during the installation of the
warp core?
I contacted the Starbase and had
them use IP scanners. Nothing.
What about Mister Data? There
must be some connection between
his odd behavior and these
creatures. Is he infested, as
well?
No. I scanned him, but I didn't
find anything.
Data attacked Counselor Troi
because he said he saw a...
"mouth" on her shoulder...
And in that same area, you first
discovered one of the organisms...
He also saw a "straw" on the side
of my head... and Beverly found an
organism in the same spot.
Those were all images from his
dreams... maybe he's unconsciously
perceiving these creatures...
I think it's time we took a closer
look at Mister Data's dreams.
It is an interesting hypothesis.
If I am being affected by these
interphasic creatures on an
unconscious level, it may also
explain my waking dreams, and my
subsequent anti-social behavior.
What we want to do is link your
neural net into the Holodeck...
and have you activate your dream
program, so as you're dreaming...
we can observe the dream images.
Perhaps we can learn more about
the creatures by interpreting the
symbols and images in your dreams.
I see. The concept is similar to
the method of Directed Dreaming.
Exactly.
How soon can you have the link
ready?
We'd need about an hour to
establish all the interface
parameters.
Make it so.
In the meantime, Mister Data...
I'd say you should prepare for
bed.
I think we're ready, Captain...
the link is active, and the
Holodeck has been calibrated to
Data's neural net.
Ready, Mister Data?
Yes, sir.
Normally, I would wish you
pleasant dreams... but in this
case, bad dreams would be more
helpful.
I understand.
I am initializing my dream
program. Stand by...
Keep your eyes peeled. Even an
apparently insignificant image
could be an important symbol.
Right...
Hello.
Can we talk to Data directly... or
will that wake him up?
He should be perceiving us as just
another part of his dream.
Anything we say to him will be
taken in that context...
That sounds like a telephone
ringer...
I don't see a receiver...
Cake?
Thank you.
Look at that... her right
shoulder... the same place he
stabbed her...
Wait a minute... in his waking
dream, he said there was a mouth
on her shoulder...
They're both symbols of...
consumption. Food... a mouth...
Mister Data, what kind of cake is
this?
It is cellular peptide cake.
With mint frosting.
Cellular peptides... that's
exactly what the creatures are
extracting.
Will someone answer that damn
ringing!
Captain -- the ringing is getting
worse.
What could the ringing symbolize?
Sound... a bell... an old way of
communicating...
Want some? It's delicious.
Will somebody please get that!
Yes... ?
It's for you.
Picard.
Kill them.
Kill who?
Kill them... before it is too
late.
Who is this?
I am Doctor Sigmund Freud.
How does he fit into all this?
If I were to interpret my own
appearance in this dream, I would
say I am the symbolic
representation of Data's
unconscious mind trying to warn
him about the dangers he perceives
around him.
You mean, the interphasic
organisms...
Of course.
Tell me, Doctor... how can we kill
them?
Answer it.
Nien, nien, nien. Do not be so
literal. When I say answer it, I
mean respond to it... to them.
Be quiet!
What do they represent?
I don't know... but I recognize
that junction they're working on.
It's the plasma conduit we
installed with the new warp
core...
"Respond"... respond to them...
what does that mean?
What is it you're doing?
Go away. Leave us alone.
Who are you?
We are... your enemies.
Stop. You are hurting my friends
and I must --
Be quiet!
Data, the shrieking noise you made --
it causes them pain!
Be... quiet!
I believe I understand.
Geordi, you must adjust my
positronic subprocessor to emit an
interphasic pulse.
Data, what's going on?
The workmen in my dreams represent
the organisms which are trying to
demolish the ship. The incessant
ringing of the telephone, and
Freud's cautions at the other end,
were warnings of the dangers
around us.
What about the shrieking noise you
made?
My positronic subprocessors were
detecting high-frequency
interphasic signatures from the
organisms... which were
symbolically represented in my
dreams by the high shriek.
When you made those sounds, the
workmen reacted in pain...
That is why I have asked Geordi to
adjust my subprocessor. If I can
produce a high-frequency
interphasic pulse, it may have a
similar effect on the creatures.
Ready...
Picard to Sickbay. Beverly, we're
going to be sweeping the ship with
a high-frequency IP pulse.
Monitor the creatures for any
response.
Understood.
It's working, Captain...
Captain's Log, supplemental The
creatures infesting the Enterprise
have been completely eliminated.
We believe the infestation
originated within the warp core we
obtained on Starbase Eighty-four.
This conduit was manufactured on
Thanatos Seven using a new
interphasic fusion process. We
think that process must've
attracted the organisms to the
conduit... where they lay
dormant... until we activated the
warp core.
That's also why we couldn't get
the warp core on-line. The
creatures were disrupting the
plasma flow.
How long until we have warp power
again?
We'll have to manufacture a new
conduit. I'd say another six
hours.
The banquet is in eight hours...
Take your time. Give yourself
another twelve hours, if you need
it.
Understood, sir.
Ensign Tyler.
Yes, Commander?
There's something I've been
meaning to tell you...
Sir?
Thanks. You've been doing a great
job. We've got to work on toning
down your enthusiasm a little...
but I think you're going to fit in
just fine.
Thank you, sir.
Enter.
Counselor, I did not get a chance
to apologize for my behavior...
Data, don't worry about it.
Geordi explained everything. It
wasn't your fault.
But somehow I felt turnabout would
be fair play... so I made us a
little something to snack on...
I wonder... what would Freud say
about the symbolism of devouring
oneself?
Data... sometimes a cake is just
a cake.
