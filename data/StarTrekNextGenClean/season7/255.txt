Geordi... Have you found it yet?
Not yet...
Starting to get fumes... Ammonia,
fluorine, potassium cyanide...
I can feel the heat from here.
There it is!
How far?
About ten meters. Along the ODN
line. It's hot -- over two
thousand degrees.
I'm going in.
Geordi, wait.
We're okay... I've activated the
emergency supression system.
It's under control.
All his vital functions are
completely normal.
The interface unit is operating
within expected parameters.
Why did he start coughing when he
went through the gasses?
Psychosomatic response.
I feel like I'm actually here...
I mean there -- in the Jefferies
tube. I saw the smoke and I
couldn't help coughing.
No one else has reported so
complete a sensory experience.
The interface is perfect for
Geordi because his VISOR inputs
allow the probe to transmit
information directly into his
cerebral cortex.
It looks like this is going to
work. Let's get the probe out of
the Jefferies tube and into the
launch bay before we reach Marijne
Seven.
Will do...
Something's wrong. I'm having
trouble controlling my left leg.
What is it?
The probe is designed to respond
to the movements Geordi intends to
make -- when his brain sends a
message to move his leg, the
interface moves the probe instead.
Apparently the gain on the tactile
sensors is too low; I will
increase the input.
There it goes.
I'm on my way down.
Why the body-suit?
It provides tactile sensations so
that Geordi will feel as if he is
in the same environment as the
probe.
What's wrong?
Nothing...
I just saw my reflection in a
panel.
I forgot what a handsome guy I am.
Captain's Log, Stardate 47215.5.
We are responding to a distress
call from the science vessel
Raman, which is apparently trapped
inside the turbulent atmosphere of
an unusual gas giant planet. We
will use an experimental interface
probe in our attempt to rescue it.
I have reviewed the vessel's
mission plans. The Raman was to
descend to the lower atmosphere,
eleven thousand kilometers below
its current position...
The crew was to sample the
atmosphere at that level, and then
return to a safer orbit.
Something must have happened down
there. Maybe the shields failed,
or they had an inversion reaction
in the nacelles.
Any life signs?
Our bio-sensors are useless --
there's too much interference in
the atmosphere.
The crew might still be alive.
But we'll never be able to tell
from up here.
Will the probe be able to transmit
through the interference?
The probe sends information via a
focused particle beam that should
be able to cut through the
interference.
But we may have to operate the
interface at near tolerance
levels.
Will your nervous system be able
to handle that much sensory input?
We've tested the interface at up
to seventy percent of tolerance.
There shouldn't be a problem going
higher -- the safety override will
kick in at ninety-eight percent
tolerance and disengage the
interface.
Captain, I am receiving a
transmission from Starfleet
Command -- Admiral Holt.
In my Ready Room.
The seven people on that ship are
our first priority. Is the probe
ready for launch?
Yes, Sir.
Send it directly to the aft
section of the Raman, through the
secondary air lock. That'll put
it one bulkhead away from the
Bridge.
I'll interface with the probe as
soon as it's in place and take it
in the rest of the way.
Make it so.
Onscreen.
Hello, Marcus.
Jean-Luc.
How's life on DS-Three?
We're hosting this year's palio.
The Ferengi have already been
accused of trying to bribe the
Breen pilot into throwing the
race...
Nothing unusual about that.
Nothing at all...
I wish I could say I was just
calling to catch up on things.
Nine days ago, the Hera left here
on a routine courier mission. We
were in contact with them for five
of those days. Then the ship
disappeared without a trace.
The Hera?
I'm afraid so.
The Excelsior and the Noble have
spent the last seventy-two hours
retracing its course. Nothing.
I'm going to keep them at it for
seventy-two more.
But to be honest, I don't think
another week would make any
difference.
I'll tell Commander LaForge...
Mister Data, I need a word with
Commander LaForge.
Yes, Sir.
I will be on the Bridge.
I've just spoken to Starfleet.
The Hera is missing.
Missing... ?
What about my mother... ?
Captain LaForge has disappeared
along with the rest of her crew...
-- I saw your father last week and
your sister about ten days before
that. I decided I missed my
favorite son...
Your only son, Mom...
You're going to have to see the
Hera again. We've got a lot of
new faces on board. Including a
chief engineer who juices up the
nacelles every chance she gets.
I think she's the best technician
in the fleet.
Okay, second best.
Come in...
I didn't mean to interrupt.
Don't worry about it.
Maybe you should meet her. We're
going to be in the same sector
next week. Take a shuttle over
and I'll introduce you.
Mom's always trying to find me a
wife.
But if you're too busy, I'll see
you at your father's birthday
party. Remember, if you talk to
him -- it's a surprise.
This came in about three weeks
ago.
I never got back to her...
Geordi, the probe has entered the
planet's atmosphere. I'm ready to
move it inside the ship.
If you want to take a couple of
days off, I'll run the interface.
The interface is calibrated
specifically for my VISOR inputs.
You'd need at least ten hours to
convert it. Those crewmen down
there can't wait...
The interface doesn't have to be
fully compatible. I could use it
right now. I wouldn't have the
control you'd have, but it would
still work.
Forget it. I'm the best one for
the job, and there's no reason not
to go ahead as planned.
The Hera is reason enough.
The Hera is missing. That's all.
Until I hear something more, my
mother might just as well have
taken the crew on an unscheduled
holiday.
Let's go.
Sir, the probe is through the
airlock and in position aboard the
Raman.
Picard to Commander Data. Report.
We are ready to bring the
interface on line.
Proceed.
Activating the remote sensors...
Initiating interface... now.
Vital signs normal... How do you
feel, Geordi?
Fine...
Do you have visual contact?
Not yet...
Increase the input signal, Data.
I'm not seeing anything...
Acknowledged.
I can see. But no colors.
Increasing signal strength of
seventy-five percent of tolerance.
That's better.
Your pulse has gone up...
It might take your nervous system
a little while to get used to this
input level.
I'm excited, that's all. This is
like being on a roller coaster.
Or a first date... Everything's
okay.
I'll be the judge of that, Geordi.
If your heart rate goes too high,
we'll disconnect you.
Understood. But don't pull the
plug yet...
It's a mess in here. There must
be a hull breach somewhere. I'm
picking up atmospheric gasses
inside the corridor -- methane and
ammonia primarily.
I'm heading toward the Bridge.
It's getting worse the closer I
get. The break in the hull might
be on the Bridge itself.
I found somebody!
What is your position?
About twelve meters up the main
corridor! A section of the
bulkhead collapsed on top of him.
I can't move it. I need more
power to the tractor beams.
Go to eighty percent of tolerance --
no higher.
He looks pretty bad.
He's dead.
Data, the door halfway down the
left corridor... what's it lead
to?
A magnetic storage bay.
If there was a breach on the
Bridge, that would be the safest
place to go.
Data, I need a phaser burst. Wide
focus, level four intensity.
I've found them!
They're dead... all of them.
There's a fire in here...
Data! Disconnect him!
What happened?
I don't know... My hands...
They're burned...
How did this happen?
There was some kind of energy
discharge in the interface suit.
Shouldn't the safety over-rides
have prevented that?
Yes... but I have a theory why
they didn't.
The tolerance levels on the
interface were set extremely high.
I think Geordi's neural response
to the input was so strong that it
created a feedback loop.
The sensors that were transmitting
the sensation of heat to my hands
must've overloaded.
I know it seems hard to believe,
but the probe was sending huge
amounts of sensory data directly
into Geordi's brain. The
tolerance levels on the interface
were set extremely high.
The Raman's crew is dead. I'd
like to retrieve their vessel, but
not if it means risking Geordi's
safety.
If we turn down the sensory input
from the probe, I should be fine.
Seven people lost their lives down
there... we should at least
retrieve the data they were
collecting. Otherwise their
deaths won't have any meaning.
Doctor?
If we operate the interface at
lower input levels, I'd say the
risk is acceptable.
Alright.
Picard to Riker.
Riker, here.
The Raman's crew is dead. I'd
like to retrieve their vessel, but
not if it means risking Geordi's
safety.
If we turn down the sensory input
from the probe, I should be fine.
Seven people lost their lives down
there... we should at least
retrieve the data they were
collecting.
Doctor?
If we operate the interface at
lower input levels, I'd say the
risk is acceptable.
Alright.
Picard to Riker.
Riker, here.
I've decided to proceed with the
probe.
We'll have to take it into the
Raman's auxiliary control room --
the Bridge is too badly damaged.
How long before you can get it
into position?
A few hours -- we're going to have
to cut through a bulkhead.
Acknowledged.
Looks like you'll have some time
to recuperate.
There's something I need to do
anyway.
How are you, Dad?
As well as expected, given the
circumstances. Are you okay?
Yeah...
I talked to your sister this
morning. She said she'd get in
touch with you in a few days.
Right now she's pretty upset.
The service for the Hera will
probably be on Vulcan -- most of
the crew was from there. But your
sister and I want to have a
private ceremony --
-- Dad. Don't you think
everybody's jumping the gun here?
Last I heard, two starships were
still out there looking. They've
found no debris, no residual warp
distortion --
-- And no ship.
Not yet. That doesn't mean they
won't.
Starfleet is considering the Hera
lost. The search isn't much more
than a formality at this point.
Geordi, your mother's gone...
You can think that if you want.
But until I see some hard
evidence, I'm not going to give up
hope.
All right, Geordi. Call me if you
need anything...
Come in.
Hey, Data. Still working?
No. I have completed the
adjustments on the interface. I
am now waiting for Commander Riker
to finish moving the probe.
Do you wish to be comforted?
No... I was just passing by.
Wondered what you were up to.
I am using the time to catch up on
my study of poetry.
Data, there's nothing on the
screen.
That is not entirely correct.
While it is true the display is
currently blank, this emptiness
has a poetic meaning. So it
cannot be considered "nothing" as
such.
Says who?
The ancient Doosodarians. Much of
their poetry contained such
"lacunae" or empty spaces. Often
these pauses measured several days
in length, during which poet and
audience were encouraged to fully
acknowledge the emptiness of the
experience.
I remember some lectures at
Starfleet academy that seemed like
that.
Are you certain you do not wish to
talk about your mother?
Why do you ask that?
You are no doubt feeling emotional
distress as a result of her
disappearance. Though you claimed
to be "just passing by," that is
most likely an excuse to start a
conversation about this
uncomfortable subject. Am I
correct?
Well, no. Sometimes "just passing
by" means "just passing by."
Then I apologize for my premature
assumption.
This particular poem has a lacuna
of forty-seven minutes. You may
experience the emptiness with me
if you wish.
Thanks...
Data, maybe you gave up too fast.
I do not understand.
When I said "just passing by"
means "just passing by" -- I
didn't really mean it.
My initial assumption was correct.
You do wish to speak of your
mother.
Am I crazy to think she's still
alive?
Your sanity is not in question.
However, your evaluation of the
available information is...
biased.
She's the captain of a starship!
She's gotten herself into and out
of impossible situations before.
Why should this be any different?
Disappearances fitting the profile
of the Hera have rarely ended with
the safe recovery of ship and
crew.
That makes me feel better.
I'm sorry, Data. I didn't mean to
snap at you.
I am not offended. You are upset
and your reactions are not
surprising.
I guess I am a little... on edge.
It's just that... If she really is
dead...
I don't know what I'm going to
do...
We're receiving the probe's
telemetry.
The input levels are currently at
fifty-three percent of tolerance.
That's too low, Data. I won't be
able to do anything down there.
I want to start with as wide a
margin of safety as possible. We
can adjust upward as needed.
Ready?
Go ahead.
Initiating interface...
I can't see anything.
I am increasing input now...
That's better... but I need
more...
Is this level sufficient?
Geordi?
Geordi, can you hear me?
Mom...
Mom, is it you?
Is it you... ?
I forgot! All you're seeing is a
probe. Yes, it's me. I'm on the
Enterprise. I'm interfaced with
this probe.
Geordi. Who are you talking to?
What are you seeing?
But is it really you?
Yes, Geordi. It's me.
How can it be... ? How is it
possible --
There's no time to explain. We
have to go down...
Down where?
The surface.
Geordi. Report.
Hang on, Doctor...
Why? Why do we have to go to the
surface?
We're dying.
"We?" Your ship? The Hera is
down there?
Geordi, we're disconnecting you
right now...
No. Wait...
We need your help. I need your
help... Geordi...
The cut-off has been automatically
activated.
He's in neural shock --
The sensory overload didn't cause
any permanent damage -- but I
wouldn't want to expose his
nervous system to that much
stimulus again.
Is there any indication of what
caused the hallucination?
His brain functions are normal --
I told you, I wasn't
hallucinating.
Geordi, I have analyzed the
probe's sensor logs -- there are
no readings that would indicate
the presence of a living human on
board the Raman.
She wasn't actually there. Her
ship is on the surface.
Then you believe you saw some kind
of... transmission?
Somehow she managed to contact me.
We have no indication of a
transmission of any kind.
Maybe I'm the only one who could
detect it -- because I was
interfaced with the probe.
The probe does allow Geordi to
sense quantum fluctuations,
subspace anomalies, and other
phenomena not perceptible to other
kinds of sensors.
Granted. But why would he
perceive his mother visually, as
if she were standing in the room?
I'm not sure... I do know that our
brains aren't designed to process
the kind of sensory information
Geordi was getting. When the
brain receives something it can't
understand, it interprets the
input as best it can -- sometimes
as a sound or smell, sometimes
visually.
You see?
Geordi, that doesn't mean you're
mother was really communicating
with you. I'm just trying to
explain why you might've thought
she was.
I'm telling you, my mother's ship
is trapped down there -- they need
our help.
The Hera's last reported location
was over three hundred light years
away. How could it have ended up
here?
If the Hera is on the surface, its
hull could not possibly withstand
the pressure of the atmosphere.
Just let me go back so we can be
sure.
I don't recommend he use the
interface again -- the sensory
overload nearly killed him.
I'll be all right.
I'm sorry, Geordi. But I won't
risk your life.
Mister Data, find another way to
salvage the Raman. I want to hear
an alternate plan in two hours.
Yes, Captain.
In the meantime, I'd like you to
talk with Counselor Troi. She's
expecting you.
Aye, Sir...
What's your mother like, Geordi?
Counselor, if you think I'm going
to start talking about my
childhood, you're way off.
That's not what I asked.
No, I guess not.
She was --
She is... brilliant, funny...
really perceptive. She knows
people. Knows what they're all
about even before they open their
mouths. She's always been like
that. A good judge of character.
When did you see her last?
Seven months ago, when she first
took command of the Hera. I went
to a party she had for her crew...
The Enterprise and the Hera were
in the same sector three weeks
ago. She wanted to see me. We
were both pretty busy though...
I guess I could have made the
time. But I didn't think... I
mean I just didn't think...
You didn't think it would be your
last chance to see her...
You don't know that! None of us
does!
I'm going to suggest something.
Call it a theory. Alright?
Alright...
You're very worried about the
disappearance of your mother...
and guilty over not seeing her
when you had the chance. So
you're unwilling even to consider
that she might be dead. This need
to believe she's alive is so
strong, it manifested itself as a
physical image.
But she told me she's trapped on
the planet! She's in danger! If
this was some kind of wish
fulfillment, don't you think I'd
fantasize her being safe and
sound?
No. Because that would end the
fantasy -- you'd know it wasn't
true. The more involved and
complicated and unending your
story is, the longer you can
believe your mother is still
alive.
That's your theory, Counselor.
I've got a different one.
I have been exploring the
possibility of using a tractor
beam to pull the Raman from the
atmosphere. However, there is so
much interference that it prevents
a positive lock.
If we could set up some sort of
relay system...
That is my conclusion as well,
Commander. Two shuttlecraft,
staggered between the Enterprise
and the Raman, with their shields
adjusted to refocus the tractor
beam.
Can we get those shuttles close
enough without putting them in
danger?
Mister LaForge.
I suppose so.
Yes. As long as you keep them
above the troposphere, they'll be
alright.
In that case --
What about the Hera?
We'll be leaving my mother and her
crew stranded on the planet. We
have to save them.
Commander --
-- I've been thinking about
this...
A few weeks ago I got a message
from my mother. She said she had
a new chief engineer who was
always experimenting with the warp
drive.
Well, I've seen the Hera -- it
uses trionic initiators in the
warp coil. They have a history of
strange side effects -- especially
if you start playing around with
them.
There have been reports of warp
bubbles and other subspace
deformations.
So what if that's what happened?
Not a warp bubble, but a subspace
funnel.
Connecting two points through
subspace.
The Hera could have accidentally
created a distortion that emptied
out right here, on Marijne Seven.
Why here?
The Hera passed near this planet
just ten days ago. There's a lot
of subspace distortion in the
atmosphere -- the ship might've
picked up some residual traces
that directed the funnel back
here.
And the Hera is still in one
piece, down on the surface?
Maybe it's surrounded by some kind
of subspace field that's keeping
it together. But who knows for
how long?
Do you have any evidence to
support this... hypothesis?
I did get some strange subspace
readings when I was interfaced
with the probe.
Geordi, that could be anything.
I talked to her. She asked me to
take the Raman closer to the
planet.
Is any of this possible?
Yes.
There.
However, I believe it is...
unlikely.
How unlikely?
Nearly impossible, Sir.
Proceed with the shuttle plan.
Captain --
-- Mister LaForge. Stay here for
a moment.
Geordi, I'm not unsympathetic
about what you're going through.
But I want you to consider my
position as well.
Yes, Sir.
Your mother's disappearance...
It's... a tragic thing...
But I can't risk your safety on
the basis of a dubious hypothesis.
If there's even one chance in a
million I'm right and she's
alive...
I'm sorry, Geordi. I've made my
decision.
I understand, Sir.
I suspected you would decide to
operate the interface alone.
You did?
I am familiar enough with your
behavior patterns to predict
certain... decisions.
I guess you know me pretty well...
You are disobeying the Captain.
I can't just sit back and do
nothing when my mother might be
down on that planet.
I can not allow you to endanger
your well being.
If we leave here without knowing
for sure...
I'll have to live with it for the
rest of my life... wondering... if
I left her to die... I couldn't
take that, Data... I couldn't...
That's why I have to do this.
I could have you confined to
quarters for the duration of the
mission.
If you want to do that to me,
Data, then go ahead. Because
nothing less is going to stop me
from trying to save my mother.
What are you doing?
I will monitor the interface and
attempt to keep you safe.
I can not have you confined to
quarters for something you have
not yet done.
Data, we could both end up in a
lot of trouble for this.
There is a high degree of
probability that you are right.
Thanks, Data.
However, I have a request.
What's that?
I would ask you to consider the
possibility that what you see is
not real.
I will. I promise.
I am establishing the interface...
Mom... ?
Hello, Geordi...
How did you get here?
I'm not really with you, Geordi.
I'm on my ship, on the surface.
We were pulled into a warp funnel.
That's just what I thought!
How are we communicating?
We found a way to send a subspace
signal that could cut through the
atmospheric interference.
Geordi, are you seeing the image
of your mother... ?
Yes, and she just confirmed
everything I've been saying.
I am reading some unusual subspace
energy in your vicinity -- similar
to what the probe sensors recorded
the first time you encountered
your mother.
That's how she's communicating
with me. It's the only kind of
signal they could send that would
get through the interference.
We need your help.
I've been thinking about this --
I'm going to take the Raman into
a low stationary orbit and
initiate an inverse warp cascade.
Why?
The subspace distortion from the
cascade should reverse the warp
funnel -- your ship will end up
right where it started.
Geordi, the atmosphere becomes
increasingly turbulent the farther
down you go -- you may not be able
to bring the Raman close enough to
the Hera before being destroyed.
I have to try, Data.
We're running out of time.
Shields back on line... we're
starting our descent...
Thank god...
Thank... god...
That you're alive -- that I was
right about all this.
I can't wait to call Dad. He and
Ariana had given up...
We're going home...
Eventually, yeah.
Data -- everything's fading in and
out.
I'm losing the interface.
The probe is descending out of
range.
You're going to have to turn up
the input gain to maintain my
connection.
It is already at seventy-five
percent of tolerance.
You can take it all the way up to
a hundred if you increase it
slowly enough -- give my nervous
system time to adapt.
That is theoretically true. But
even at this input level you have
already experienced dangerous
neural feedback.
Data, there are over three hundred
people on board the Hera. We're
the only chance they've got.
I will increase the gain
incrementally as you descend.
It's working.
When we are ready to disconnect
the interface, we must allow
sufficient time to lower the input
levels -- otherwise your nervous
system would go into shock from
the sudden drop in input.
Once I initiate the warp cascade
we can start dropping the gain.
We'll be in sensor range of your
ship within a few minutes.
I'm sorry I didn't get over to see
you a few weeks ago.
You were... too busy with work.
I'm sorry; it won't happen again.
Captain, the Raman is descending
toward the planet.
Geordi...
Geordi, we are now at ninety
percent of tolerance.
My calculations show that you will
reach one hundred percent of
tolerance before you are in range
of the Hera.
Then we're going to have to go
beyond tolerance.
That is not advisable. You must
cease your descent.
Geordi, don't stop... please.
Data, I'm taking this ship down.
If you don't boost the gain past
tolerance levels, I'll lose the
interface when we go out of range
and my nervous system will go into
shock.
You are putting me in a very
difficult position. Please cease
your descent.
I won't do it... so you'd better
increase the tolerance...
Disengaging safety systems...
going to full tolerance levels...
now.
Thanks, Data.
We're getting close...
Thank god...
LaForge.
Yes, Captain?
Stop your descent and prepare to
disengage the interface.
I'm sorry, sir. But I can't do
that.
Damn it, Geordi -- you're going to
kill yourself...
If I come back now, my mother and
her entire crew will die.
I'm scanning for your ship...
I'm not getting anything.
We're still too far away...
Not really. I should be picking
something up by now.
I'm not finding anything... No
warp funnel... No ship... There's
nothing there.
His neural synapses are
overloading.
He can't survive this...
Geordi -- what's happening to you?
Geordi!
Reverse tractors -- Reverse --
Reversing tractor beams...
What are you?
You are killing us... We must go
down.
Geordi... Report.
You're trapped... ?
Is there any way we can disconnect
him?
If we cut him off abruptly, he'll
go into neural shock.
How can we lower the input
gradually and still get him out
before it's too late?
Perhaps we can deceive his neural
receptors.
Deceive them?
By feeding them the sensory
information recorded from his
earlier experiences with the
probe.
We could disconnect the interface
and still maintain the input
levels.
We could then lower them in a
controlled manner.
Like a decompression tank.
Let's try it.
Captain. I have to take the ship
into the lower atmosphere...
Explain.
As I understand it... when the
Raman got close to the planet,
they accidentally picked up some
lifeforms that live in the lower
atmosphere. Subspace beings of
some kind -- intelligent. When
the ship went back into a higher
orbit, the beings were trapped.
How do you know all this?
One of them is able to communicate
with me. It must have read my
thoughts through the probe
interface and took the form of my
Mother -- to try to talk me into
taking the ship closer to the
surface.
Were these beings responsible for
the death of the Raman's crew?
Yes, but I don't think it was on
purpose. They probably tried to
communicate with them the same way
they're communicating with me --
by directly accessing their
thoughts. That must've been fatal
to the crew... I guess the
interface protected me.
I have to take them back -- they
can't survive so far up in the
atmosphere.
I'll turn the ship around and come
back as soon as we're --
LaForge! What happened?
The atmosphere is getting more
turbulent. It's overloading the
systems.
I'm having trouble keeping the
shields up.
Geordi...
We're safe now...
Good bye...
I'm losing power...
