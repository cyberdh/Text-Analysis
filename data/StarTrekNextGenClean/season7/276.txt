Captain's Log, Stardate 47941.7.
The Enterprise is en route to a
briefing on the situation in the
Demilitarized Zone along the
Cardassian border. Meanwhile, we
are celebrating the return of an
old friend.
Welcome home.
Thanks. It's good to be back.
Congratulations on your promotion --
Lieutenant.
Same to you -- Commander.
Thank you.
I hear Advanced Tactical Training
is a real picnic...
Right...
Did you see the buffet?
Yes, that's real Bajoran foraiga.
It wasn't easy to find.
You shouldn't have gone to all
this trouble...
Where are your new quarters?
Deck eight, section four.
What do you plan to --
Picard to Lieutenant Ro.
Go ahead, sir.
Please report to the Bridge.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me.
Captain...
You seemed a bit overwhelmed by
all the attention... I thought you
could use a break.
To tell you the truth, I could...
I want to see everyone, but I
think I'd rather do it one at a
time.
You're looking fit, Lieutenant.
Tactical Training must have agreed
with you.
You know me -- I enjoy a
challenge.
That school is more than a
challenge. Half the class washes
out every year.
Somehow I knew you wouldn't be one
of those.
I want you to know I appreciate
your recommending me.
If it weren't for you, sir -- my
life would be a much different one
right now.
Bridge to Captain --
Go ahead.
We're receiving a distress signal
from a Cardassian ship near the
Demilitarized Zone.
Change course to intercept -- I'm
on my way.
I'd like you at the Conn,
Lieutenant.
Report.
The Cardassian ship relayed a
distress signal but it was cut off
before they could tell us what was
wrong.
I've got the ship on long-range
sensors.
It appears to be under attack --
by several small ships.
Can you identify them?
No, sir. They aren't transmitting
identification codes.
I will scan their warp signatures.
Sir, sensors indicate that the
attacking vessels are Federation
ships.
We're coming into visual range.
On screen.
Those are Federation ships.
Isolate one and magnify.
The Maquis...
Open a channel.
To all Maquis ships -- call off
your attack or we will be forced
to engage you.
No response.
You are Federation citizens. Your
actions are in violation of our
treaty with the Cardassians. Call
off your attack.
Are we in firing range?
Not yet, sir.
Arm phasers and photon torpedoes
and stand by.
I never thought we'd be firing on
our own people to protect a
Cardassian ship...
The Maquis ships are regrouping...
they are closing in on the
Cardassian vessel.
The Cardassian's shields are down
to thirty percent.
They may not be able to withstand
another hit.
Sir, we are within weapons range.
Mister Worf, can you detonate a
torpedo spread between the Maquis
ships and the Cardassians?
Yes, sir.
Do it.
The Maquis are breaking formation --
they are withdrawing.
Signal the Cardassians that we're
standing by to assist them if they
have any wounded.
Do your people have experience
treating Cardassians?
Yes. Now please, sit still.
Gul Evek. I'm sorry we weren't
able to come to your aid sooner.
I suppose we're lucky you came at
all... lately Starfleet seems to
look the other way when the Maquis
attack.
I assure you that's not the case.
We're doing everything we can to
control them.
The fact that they attacked my
ship suggests your efforts have
met with limited success.
The Maquis came at us with photon
torpedoes and type eight phasers --
tell me, Captain, how do you
suppose a group of civilians
acquired that kind of weaponry?
It was certainly not through
official channels.
You don't think the fact that some
of the Maquis are former Starfleet
officers has anything to do with
it?
Starfleet does not condone the
Maquis' actions in the
Demilitarized Zone.
Any more than your government
condones paramilitary actions by
Cardassian civilians.
We have taken measures to deal
with our colonists who have armed
themselves.
Considering that they destroyed a
Juhryan freighter less than a week
ago, I'd say your efforts have met
with limited success.
Give our military the right to
operate in the Zone for one week,
and we'll put a stop to
paramilitary activity once and for
all.
What you're proposing would only
perpetuate the cycle of violence.
Captain, if the Maquis aren't
stopped, this situation is going
to escalate to the point where the
Cardassian military will have no
choice but to take matters into
its own hands.
Captain's Log, supplemental. Gul
Evek and his crew have left the
Enterprise, and we have proceeded
to our rendezvous with Admiral
Nechayev.
No Bularian canapes this time,
Captain?
Twice seemed to be pushing it a
little...
It's just as well.
They're extremely fattening.
You missed Gul Evek by a matter of
hours. I asked him to stay -- I
thought perhaps an admiral's
assurances would convince him that
we are trying to deal with the
Maquis situation.
Evek manages to make the
Cardassians sound like helpless
sheep being preyed on by
Federation wolves. The truth is,
we caught the Cardassian
government supplying its colonies
in the Demilitarized Zone with
weapons.
Gul Evek assures me that practice
has stopped.
Ah. How comforting.
Admiral... this Maquis situation
has you worried...
It's a mess... and it just keeps
getting worse. I never imagined
I'd have to worry about Federation
citizens doing violence to others.
Frankly, I can understand why our
colonists have taken up arms --
Starfleet isn't there to protect
them anymore.
Believe me, Captain, if I were
living that close to the
Cardassians I'd keep a phaser
under my pillow, too.
But in the last few weeks we've
seen signs that the Maquis are
moving beyond self-defense. Their
ranks are growing... they've
acquired ships, weapons... they
seem to be preparing for a more
aggressive military posture.
We have to put a stop to them...
before the entire Demilitarized
Zone ignites.
But before we can stop them -- we
have to find them. They seem to
be scattered in small cells around
the Zone. And we don't have
reliable intelligence about any of
them.
Perhaps you need an undercover
operative.
Our thinking exactly. We intend
to infiltrate their organization.
And the person we want to do it is
aboard your ship right now.
Starfleet wants me to infiltrate
the Maquis?
Because of your recent training...
because you're Bajoran... and
because of your past troubles with
Starfleet -- you'll have a certain
credibility.
Well, that's certainly true.
And just when would this mission
begin?
Immediately.
I see.
I've spent the better part of my
life fighting the Cardassians...
I never thought I'd be helping
them out.
This is a rare case where our
interests coincide with theirs --
we both want peace in the
Demilitarized Zone.
I've heard a lot about the Maquis.
One of my instructors in Tactical
Training... a Lieutenant Commander
in Starfleet -- a man I admired
and respectded... was sympathetic
to them. He resigned and left to
join them.
We're all sympathetic, Lieutenant.
Our civilian population in the
Demilitarized Zone is in a
difficult situation.
But sympathy ends at a certain
point. The peace treaty isn't
just a piece of paper. If the
Maquis force us into a war with
Cardassia, it could mean hundreds
of thousands of lives.
Laren, two years ago, Starfleet
would never have tapped you for
this mission. They must have a
lot of confidence in you now.
The way I see it... there's at
least one good reason to take this
mission, sir.
That's to validate your faith in
me.
We are looking for a Bajoran
woman, dark hair.
She is responsible for the death
of a Cardassian soldier.
If we learn that she has been
here, this establishment will be
closed down.
You say she had dark hair?
Yes.
She was here... you just missed
her.
Do you know where she went?
No.
Nice meeting you --
Thanks.
Did you kill that Cardassian?
Starfleet thinks I did. That's
reason enough to hide.
Why did you tell them I'd left?
There are worse things a person
could do than kill a Cardassian
soldier.
You don't often meet someone
willing to say that out loud.
In the Zone, there are a lot of us
who feel that way.
I'd like to meet people like that.
Don't be afraid. You're not in
danger here.
What's your name?
Did you kill that Cardassian
soldier?
Who are you?
The people who saved you from
Starfleet.
Thanks.
But I'll be leaving now.
Do you even know what planet
you're on?
Ronara Prime.
Not anymore.
Where am I then?
We're not going to tell you that
until we know more about you.
Like what?
Did you kill that Cardassian?
Yes.
That's a risky thing to do in the
Demilitarized Zone. You can end
up being hunted by Starfleet and
the Cardassians.
Then... why did he risk bringing
me here?
We're asking the questions. Who
are you?
My name is Ro Laren. I grew up in
the Bajoran camps...
That would explain why you have no
love for Cardassians.
I know what they're capable of.
They tortured my father to
death... and forced me to watch.
Where do you live now?
Nowhere...
I was a Starfleet officer. But I
was court martialed and spent time
in the stockade on Jaros Two. I'm
not exactly what you'd call
Starfleet material.
When were you on Jaros?
What difference does it make?
We want to check your story. When
were you there?
Starfleet let me out about three
years ago because I agreed to do
some work for them... mostly
having to do with Bajor. But I
got tired of watching them placate
the Cardassians and left.
You resigned?
Not officially.
That's part of the reason they're
looking for me.
What were you doing on Ronara?
Look, I've answered enough of your
questions -- I'd like to know who
you people are.
Let's just say... we sympathize
with those who oppose Cardassia.
Are you Maquis?
What if we were... ?
If you were... then I would ask if
I could join you and help you
fight.
We will check your story.
Go ahead. I'll keep an eye on
her.
My circulation isn't what it used
to be...
Come... let's stretch our legs.
Aren't you taking a chance by
letting me see all this? What if
my story doesn't check out -- what
if I'm not who I say I am?
Then we'll have a problem, won't
we?
You are Maquis, aren't you?
Many people here are.
Starfleet considers you outlaws.
They're afraid you'll destroy the
peace treaty.
They don't understand the
situation here in the Zone.
I lived on Juhraya... the colony
suddenly found itself in
Cardassian territory when the
treaty was signed. Some of us
chose to stay and take our
chances.
One night I was dragged from my
bed and beaten. The authorities
clucked their tongues and agreed
it was an unfortunate incident...
and did nothing.
I'm not surprised. The
Cardassians intend to make life so
unpleasant for Federation citizens
that they'll leave.
Exactly. And no one seems to see
that except the Maquis.
How old were you when your father
was killed?
I'd rather not talk about it.
Are you hungry? Would you like
something?
No. Thank you.
Hasperat.
You like hasperat?
An old Bajoran friend of mine used
to make it. Although his was much
stronger.
He died years ago... fighting the
Cardassian occupation of Bajor...
I miss his company... and his
hasperat...
My father made the strongest
hasperat you've ever tasted.
Everything else seems mild by
comparison.
Did he teach you how to make it?
Yes. But I haven't tried it in
years.
If you would make the brine for
truly strong hasperat -- and I
mean eye-watering, tongue-searing
strong -- you would make an old
man very happy.
I'd enjoy making it again.
Macias...
I checked with my sources at
Starfleet...
Her story's true.
I was sure it was.
Kalita -- she'll stay with you
until we can find her a room.
Why aren't you with the others?
Kalita told me to stay here -- she
had things to do.
You've been here a week and she
still doesn't trust you.
We're meeting to discuss
strategy...
So that's what she meant by
"things to do." Kalita reminds
me of someone I knew during the
occupation... being a part of the
resistance was the only thing he
cared about. It was his identity.
That does sound like Kalita...
Don't get me wrong, I was glad to
have him on my side... but he was
hard to be around.
Sometimes people would stay up
late... telling stories -- you
know, trying to forget about our
troubles for a while. Kanore
would come out of his tent in a
huff and tell everyone to be quiet --
that we should get some rest so
we'd have "strength for our
struggle."
What would people do?
We'd ignore him.
That sounds like the only way to
handle a person like that...
I have to go... the meeting's
about to start.
Ah... there you are.
We've just heard a disturbing
rumor.
Another rumor?
One that I think we should take
seriously. A trader coming from
Pendi Two said he could verify
that the Cardassians are going to
start supplying their colonists
with bio-genic weapons.
I thought every shipment coming
into the Zone was searched...
The Cardassians always seem to
find a way to get around problems
like that.
We have to make a preemptive
strike. Send a message to
Cardassia that we won't sit still
and let them kill us with toxins.
Agreed. But we can't mount a
strike without medical supplies --
and our stockpile is dangerously
low.
If we put in a request for more,
it'll draw suspicion.
I can get medical supplies.
I served on the Enterprise. They
keep extra med-kits on hand for
relief missions.
You're wanted by Starfleet.
They're not going to give you medkits
just because you ask.
I have no intention of asking. I
intend to take them.
How? The Enterprise is a
fortress.
I know how its security systems
work. Give me a ship... I can do
it.
It's madness...
We can't trust her with something
like this. We don't know anything
about her.
I know... that she can make very
strong hasperat.
What?
We need medical supplies. I think
we should let her try.
All right. But I'm going with
her.
I could use an extra hand at the
controls. And a witness.
I set the transporter confinement
parameters to maximum -- we should
be able to fill our hold with
medical supplies in just a single
beam out.
I had no idea it was going to be
so easy...
We're approaching the Federation
border...
How do you plan to get out of the
Demilitarized Zone without being
searched at one of the checkpoints?
We're going to cross the border
here.
There are sensor buoys all along
the border. If we cross anywhere
other than a checkpoint, Starfleet
will send a ship to investigate.
With the right security codes, we
can disable the proximity
detectors on the buoys.
Starfleet changes those codes all
the time.
I know the encryption algorithims.
If I can access the bouy's
protocol subsystem I should be
able to figure out the codes.
Should be able to?
Do you want this mission to
succeed?
Of course I do -- we need those
medical supplies.
In that case, let me do my job.
I'm in...
What's wrong?
If I don't input the right code in
the next twenty seconds, we'll
trigger the proximity alarm.
I'm getting us out of sensor
range.
Don't. If we break the com-link,
we won't be able to try again.
It worked... until they change the
access codes again, we can cross
the border here.
Captain's Log, Stardate 47943.2.
It has been over a week since
Lieutenant Ro left the
Enterprise... we have yet to
receive any communication from
her.
We picked up a request for
emergency assistance from a
Federation science ship in the
Topin system.
Are there any other ships in the
vicinity?
We're the closest.
Helm, set course for the Topin
system.
Signal the science ship that we're
on our way.
It is unlikely that they would
receive our communication. The
Topin system contains an unstable
binary-star. It generates
significant subspace interference.
Will we be able to use our sensors
to find them?
Most of our sensor systems will be
ineffective, although our
directional array may be able to
cut through the interference.
But that array has such a narrow
scan field...
-- we might as well break out the
palm-beacons and try to find them
that way...
This is insane... we're sitting
here with no sensors, blind to the
outside -- waiting for a galaxy
class Starship to come swooping
down on us...
Don't worry... it'll be hard for
them to locate us with just their
directional sensors. Besides,
they're looking for a damaged
science ship that wants to be
found...
They're here... Standby to engage
thrusters.
Anything?
No, sir. It will take
approximately six hours to scan
this system.
Sir -- the distress call is being
repeated.
Can you locate the signal?
I am attempting to do so.
All stop.
They're scanning our last
position.
All right, I've locked onto their
sensor beam. I'm going to use it
to maneuver into transporter
range.
How are we going to beam through
their shields?
We can't -- if we're going to get
those medical supplies, we're
going to have to take this ship
through their shields.
Sir, I am scanning the area from
which the distress signal was
sent... but I am unable to detect
a vessel.
Captain -- the computer has
detected a piggyback communication
on the last distress signal...
Can you decode it?
It will take a few moments.
Do it.
The Enterprise shields have a weak
point... When the ship is at
impulse, the thrust destabilizes
the shield configuration right at
this point.
I'm going to try to punch through
there.
Won't they detect us?
They'll know something's
penetrated the shields, but with
all the interference it'll take
them a few seconds to find us.
We'll have to beam the medical
supplies aboard and get out fast.
The message is difficult to
decode... the interference has
garbled much of the transmission.
But it seems to be from Lieutenant
Ro.
Ro... is on that ship... ?
Sir, a vessel of some kind is
attempting to penetrate our aft
shields.
Let it through.
We're going to make it...
All right, we're in...
Energizing.
Let's get out of here...
Captain, a quantity of medical
supplies was beamed out of Cargo
Bay Seven.
The vessel that penetrated our
shields is of the same design as
the ships used by the Maquis.
It is moving off...
Let it go.
There must be someone with her...
We should make it look like we're
trying to stop them.
Lock phasers on their previous
position and fire.
Now we know what they mean by
Advanced Tactical Training...
You took your ship through their
shields?
Ro parked us between their warp
nacelles. I thought she was
crazy, but it worked. She knew
exactly what she was doing.
Well, done.
We should inventory the
supplies... find out what we
have.
I'll see you later...
Well... it seems that Kalita's
decided you're not a Federation
spy after all...
She's suspicious of everyone at
first. And rightly so -- we've
learned to be cautious with
strangers.
I understand...
But I've known since I first met
you -- in your heart, you're one
of us...
Captain's Log, supplemental.
Having earned the Maquis' trust
with her raid on the Enterprise,
Lieutenant Ro has been given
access to a ship and allowed to
leave the settlement by herself.
There are rumors that the
Cardassians are supplying their
colonists with bio-genic weapons.
Frankly, I find it hard to
believe. Every ship going into
the Demilitarized Zone is being
searched.
The Maquis are convinced that the
Cardassians have found a way
around the searches.
We might be able to use that...
Sir... ?
We've come up with a plan that has
the potential to seriously curtail
the Maquis.
We want to give them a target so
threatening -- that they'd be
willing to commit as many people
and ships as possible to destroy
it.
What do you mean, give them a
target?
Bio-genic weapons, for example.
You could provide the Maquis with
intelligence that the Cardassians
are in fact supplying their
colonists with them.
That'll get their attention, all
right...
You could tell them that in order
to get past the check-points, the
Cardassians are shipping the
components for these weapons
through third parties. We'll put
together a convoy and send it
toward the Demilitarized Zone.
And when the Maquis attack it,
Starfleet will be waiting for
them.
We'll station our ships in the
Hugora Nebula to avoid detection.
Basically, I'd be leading them
into a trap...
That's correct.
If your plan works, what will
Starfleet do when the Maquis
attack the convoy?
Our intention is to outnumber them
so heavily that they'll have no
choice but to surrender.
These people are used to fighting
impossible odds -- I don't think
they're going to surrender.
I hope you're wrong. Because if
they don't, we'll have to try to
disable their vessels...
-- you know as well as I do that's
not always possible.
If you have a problem with any of
this, I need to know now.
If I did, it wouldn't stop me from
carrying out my duty, sir.
I knew I could count on you...
-- it took a while, but I managed
to patch into Starfleet's comsystem.
I intercepted a
communication from one of the
check-points on the border.
They're concerned because a Pakled
transport came through carrying
retro-viral vaccines.
Why is that a concern?
Last week, a Ferengi transport
came through carrying bio-mimetic
gels. By themselves, neither of
these is dangerous. But Starfleet
is concerned because with a few
more components the Cardassians
could put together a bio-genic
device.
What is Starfleet going to do
about it?
They can't do anything. These
items are all perfectly legal.
How close are the Cardassians to
having the components they need?
Very close. Two days ago, a
Yridian convoy left Deep Space
Nine for the Demilitarized Zone.
It's carrying isomiotic hypos,
plasma flares and quarantine pods.
We can't let that convoy reach its
destination.
But it's too big for us to go
after alone.
I'll discuss the situation with
the other cell leaders --
considering what's at stake,
they'll want to help.
I've sent a communication to the
others...
When this is over, we'll
celebrate.
When it's over?
When Cardassia realizes they can't
intimidate us into leaving our
colonies.
Something tells me it might be a
long time before we'll be
celebrating.
Don't be discouraged, Ro. It will
take time... but the important
thing is that we not give up.
I spent ten years in the camps.
I don't give up.
I've been thinking about what our
celebration will be like for a
long time. We'll have a huge
dinner... you'll make hasperat
and I'll make blueberry pie...
we'll drink wine and we'll dance.
I'll even play the belaklavion.
That will give everyone a laugh.
You... play the klavion?
Yes, badly. It's a difficult
instrument... but I enjoy the
challenge.
My father... played the klavion.
When I was very young... and
afraid of monsters under my bed...
my father would play for me. He
said the sound of the klavion had
special powers. Monsters were
afraid of it... and they'd
disappear whenever they heard it.
When I listened to the music he
played for me... I was never
afraid to go to sleep.
When he died... I realized... even
he couldn't make all the monsters
go away.
Why wait... ? Let's go to the
market. Let's get the food for a
feast. For a celebration...
A celebration of what?
Of absolutely nothing. Just to
celebrate.
I'd like that.
Macias...
They must have found out... there
was a Maquis cell here...
Kalita -- get one of the med kits.
Hurry.
You have to hang on...
When an old fighter like me
dies... someone always steps
forward to take his place...
What is it?
We just got a communication from
Lieutenant Ro. Data's decoding it
now.
She is requesting that you meet
with her.
Was that part of your plan?
No. Something must have gone
wrong.
Ale.
Not tonight.
Hello... are you alone?
I hope not.
Why don't we get acquainted... ?
There's a table in the back that's
more... private.
I'd like that.
We have to cancel the mission.
Why?
The Maquis didn't go for the bait.
They think a convoy is too big a
target.
But there are only six ships. We
could even cut down the number.
It's... it's the commitment of
resources... of grouping so many
of the Maquis together at once...
They feel it would make them too
vulnerable.
Every intelligence report I get
from Starfleet suggests that the
Maquis are eager to expand their
strikes... are looking to escalate
their activity... but you're
telling me that's not true... ?
It's... probably different in
every cell. The people I've met
tend to be more -- conservative.
I'm sure others have a more
militant attitude...
Laren... what's going on?
Do you have the money I asked you
to bring?
Yes.
Put some on the table.
What?
By this time, we should be
negotiating my price.
When you sent me on this mission,
I thought I could do it. Even
though it meant helping
Cardassians. Even though it meant
betraying people who were fighting
them.
But now... I'm not sure about
where I stand.
Laren, are you telling me you want
to back out of this mission?
Sir, I don't want to let you down,
I swear I don't --
This has nothing to do with me --
it's about you. If you back out
now, you'll be throwing away
everything you've worked for.
Wouldn't it be better to postpone
this operation... let me stay with
them longer, meet other Maquis
leaders... learn where their cells
are... it seems to me I could be
more valuable if I had more
time...
And just prolong the inevitable?
No.
We're committed to this mission.
My only question to you is -- can
you carry out your orders?
Lieutenant... I could put you
before a board of inquiry for
having lied to me about this
operation. I could certainly have
you court martialed if you
sabotage it.
But I don't want to have to
threaten you to do this... I want
you to make the decision.
I'll carry out my orders, sir.
I feel it necessary to have
Commander Riker return with you.
He can pose as a relative.
To make sure nothing happens that
might obstruct this mission.
Sorry -- I don't have that kind of
money.
Captain's Log, supplemental. We
have received word from Commander
Riker and Lieutenant Ro that the
Maquis will be attacking the
convoy as planned... our ships
have taken up position in the
Hugora Nebula to wait for them.
I have established a relay-link
with the sensor probe we left on
the perimeter of the Nebula.
This is the convoy. We are
expecting the Maquis attack force
to cross the border from the
Demilitarized Zone here.
As soon as they cross the border,
we'll intercept them...
In order to insure that the ship
Commander Riker and Lieutenant Ro
are piloting does not come under
fire, I have relayed its warp
signature to the rest of our
attack force.
Sir, the Maquis squadron is coming
into sensor range.
Go to red alert.
Squad leader to all ships.
Go ahead, squad leader.
We'll be crossing the border in
less than one minute. Arm your
weapons.
Acknowledged.
Starfleet can't make its move
until we're out of the
Demilitarized Zone. We're to
break formation and take cover in
the Nebula as soon as they appear.
The ships in the convoy are
raising their shields... they've
spotted us.
We cross the border in thirty
seconds...
What the --
I'm sorry... but I can't let this
happen.
Sir, the vessel being piloted by
Lieutenant Ro is firing a low-intensity
particle beam into the
Nebula...
What the hell is she doing?
The polarizing effect created by
the beam may make it possible for
us to be detected.
Can you counter the effect?
I will attempt to do so.
Ro, why are you firing?
Scan the Nebula -- there's a
Starfleet attack force hiding
inside it.
I see them --
Squad leader to all ships -- abort
the mission. Repeat, abort the
mission.
Sir, the Maquis ships are breaking
formation.
Have they crossed the border?
No, sir. They are withdrawing...
Sir, Lieutenant Ro's ship is not
retreating with the others...
It is heading toward us...
When she comes aboard... take her
into custody...
Alpha Seven to Alpha Nine.
Go ahead.
Stand by to beam me aboard.
Standing by.
You can take this ship back to the
Enterprise.
You're going with them?
Yes... it's been a long time since
I felt like I really belonged
somewhere.
Could you tell Captain Picard
something for me?
Tell him... that I'm sorry.
So long, Ro. Take care of
yourself.
Good-bye.
Energize.
She seemed... very sure that she
was making the right choice.
I think her only real regret...
was that she let you down.
She let us all down...
Here's my report...
