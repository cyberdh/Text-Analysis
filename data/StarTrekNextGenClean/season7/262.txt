Captain's Log, Stardate 47410.2.
The Atrean government has
requested assistance in averting
a natural disaster that is
threatening their world. Two of
their geologists have come aboard
to discuss the problem, one of
whom is a human who has been
living on Atrea Four.
Captain, our situation has
worsened since my husband and I
first contacted you. The molten
core of our planet is not just
cooling -- it's begun to solidify.
Our gravitational field has been
affected -- seismic activity has
increased by a factor of three.
If the cooling continues at this
rate -- Atrea will become
uninhabitable within thirteen
months.
We could minimize seismic activity
by creating isobaric fissures and
releasing some of the tectonic
stress -- but that would just be
a temporary fix.
The only permanent solution would
be to re-liquefy the core.
These pockets in the magma layer --
how close are they to the molten
region of the core?
A few kilometers, why?
You think that's close enough to
try ferro-plasmic infusion?
The procedure would involve using
our ship's phasers to drill down
through the planet's surface and
into the pockets -- where we would
set up a series of plasma infusion
units.
We'd trigger the units by firing
a modulated energy burst down
through the shafts.
I see... injecting sufficient
plasma directly into the core
should trigger a chain reaction...
and that will reliquify the
magma...
It should be possible to stabilize
the core temperature at ninety-three
percent of normal.
If it works, the core would remain
molten for centuries.
If you give your permission, we'll
begin immediately.
Very well. But before we proceed,
I'd like to update our geological
surveys.
I'll be glad to help you, Doctor.
I've assigned you quarters during
the time we're here. Please make
yourselves comfortable.
Thank you, Captain.
Data --
Yes, Doctor?
Do you have any idea who I am?
You are Doctor Juliana Tainer.
You lost all your early memories.
We thought you would -- but we
couldn't know for certain.
Have we met before?
Oh, Data, I was there -- right
from the beginning, on Omicron
Theta. I helped create you.
And now... look at you.
You were a colleague of Doctor
Soong?
Yes, I certainly was -- and I was
also his wife. In a way, I
suppose you could say -- I'm your
mother.
I still can't believe it... seeing
you again after all these years...
Doctor, I have no memory of you.
There's a reason for that... we
wiped your processors after we'd
finished refining your
programming.
Why don't you tell me what you do
remember... and then I'll fill in
the gaps.
My memory record begins when I was
activated by the Starfleet
officers who found me on the
Omicron Theta outpost.
After the attack by the
Crystalline Entity --
Yes. All of the inhabitants of
the colony had been killed.
But -- I discovered that my memory
banks contained the contents of
their journals and logs.
We thought you might find their
experiences useful... after your
childhood, we figured you needed
all the help you could get.
My -- childhood?
That's what I called it. You were
like a baby at first -- a hundred
kilogram baby, but still...
It took you a while to develop
motor skills... learn how to
process sensory information. And
of course Noonian was never
satisfied... he kept tinkering,
trying to make you as human as
possible. And then there was the
business about hiccuping...
Hiccuping?
He was determined that you'd have
periodic bouts of hiccups, but he
couldn't get it right -- they were
either too violent, or too
prolonged, or not noticeable at
all... I finally said, good
heavens, Noonian -- nobody likes
having hiccups. Why don't you
just forget it? So he did.
So you wiped my memory processors
after this -- childhood.
Then we deactivated you -- and
programmed you with the colonists'
logs. We were planning to reactivate
you.
But we never had the chance. The
Crystalline Entity attacked... we
had to leave quickly. We wanted
to bring you with us -- but there
was only room for two in the
escape pod.
Doctor, I have scanned the
colonists' journals... there is
only one Juliana mentioned in
them, and her last name is
O'Donnell.
That's me...
But there is no mention that my
father was married to you.
Because of my mother.
She thought Noonian was an
eccentric scientist who was too
old for me... we decided to get
married secretly and give her some
time to get used to the idea of
our being together.
We slipped away to Mavala Four and
got married there... a Klingon and
a Corvallan trader were our
witnesses...
It wasn't exactly the wedding I'd
hoped for, but Noonian had a way
of making the oddest things seem
romantic...
My father did have an unusual way
of looking at things...
How would you know that?
I encountered him once -- in the
Terlina system.
That's where we went -- after we
left the outpost... I had no idea
you'd ever met him.
It was shortly before his death.
He's... dead?
Yes.
I didn't think it would hit me
this hard...
We didn't exactly part on the best
of terms...
What do you mean?
I realized that he loved his work
as much as he loved me. Maybe
more. There we were, stuck on
that planet in the middle of a
jungle... no one else to talk to,
no -- no life. It just wasn't
enough...
That's why I left.
Anyway, it was a long time ago.
What's important is that we're
together now.
And I want to get to know you.
This has been an interesting
encounter, and one altogether
unexpected. I would like to
corroborate what you have told me
before we proceed further.
Excuse me, Doctor.
I'm just about finished
reconfiguring the phaser banks.
We should be ready to start
drilling in about an hour.
Inform me when you are ready.
What are you doing there, anyway?
I am attempting to ascertain
whether Doctor Tainer's story is
true.
Don't you believe her?
I neither doubt nor believe her.
I am simply attempting to verify
her assertions.
Well, what have you turned up so
far?
The Registrar's Office on Mavala
Four cannot confirm that Doctor
Soong was married there.
Apparently many documents were
lost when the government was
overthrown.
Then what are you looking at?
I am checking passenger manifests
to see if they went to Mavala
during the period in question.
O'Donnell, Juliana...
Soong, Noonian -- they were both
passengers on a transport that
travelled from Omicron Theta to
Mavala... and returned four days
later.
That sure seems to fit her story.
Still, the fact that they went to
Mavala does not prove they were
married there.
You know, Data... I almost get the
feeling you're trying to prove
that Doctor Tainer wasn't telling
the truth.
Not at all. I am merely unable to
reconcile her story with the fact
that my father never mentioned her
to me.
Well, she did leave him. Maybe
she broke his heart. Maybe he
just didn't want to talk about
her...
And let me ask you this... Doctor
Soong created an emotion chip for
you... didn't Lore tell you it
also contained memories --
memories Soong wanted you to have?
Yes.
It is possible that those are the
memories of my childhood. And of
my mother.
And if you think about it -- why
would she lie? Why would someone
pretend to be your mother?
I can think of no motive for such
a pretense.
I can understand why you might be
a little disconcerted by all
this... it came out of the
blue... and the story doesn't fit
neatly into your logical
processors.
That is true...
But that's life, Data. Part of
being human is learning to handle
the unexpected... to risk new
experiences even when they don't
fit your preconceptions.
I will admit that it is difficult
for me to accept the possibility
of a past about which I know
nothing...
But it is also true that I am very
curious to learn more about it.
Data...
I would like to get to know you.
Mother.
-- I wanted to make you female,
but your father insisted on a son.
We argued about it endlessly,
right up until we were ready to
assemble you.
How did you decide?
Well, Noonian walked in holding
your head in his hand and --
innocent as you please -- said it
was up to me. Of course he knew
perfectly well what he was
doing... once again, he'd made it
in his own image -- what was I to
say?
Deanna Troi... is this who you're
going to visit?
Yes.
Your father would be so pleased.
Pleased?
He was worried the sexuality
programming he designed for you
wouldn't work...
You misunderstand; Counselor Troi
is a therapist --
Good night...
Doctor Tainer has provided me with
many details about my development
that I was not aware of.
Conversing with her was a
fascinating experience --
But... ?
Her interest in me seems to be...
limitless.
She's your mother, Data. That's
how parents are.
I was a parent. I do not recall
exhibiting excessive interest in
Lal's behavior.
Data, you and Lal were practically
inseparable the entire time she
was alive.
Yes, but... she needed my help.
That's how every parent feels.
It's very hard to let your
children go out into the world and
fend for themselves. You can't
help but be protective of them.
I'm sure your mother feels the
same way.
If that is true... then why did
she never attempt to contact me?
I don't know, Data. It could have
something to do with your parents'
separating... you were part of a
life she might have wanted to put
behind her.
But if you really want to know,
why don't you ask her?
We will be in position over the
drilling site in three minutes,
twenty-nine seconds.
These scans indicate that the
magma pockets where we plan to set
up the infusion units are somewhat
unstable.
I'm going to monitor the density
of the rock layers and adjust the
strength of the particle beam as
we go. That should minimize the
seismic stress we generate while
we're drilling.
I've configured the phasers to
create the most highly focused
particle beam possible.
Thank you, Geordi.
I'm just glad to see that you have
good manners. It wasn't easy to
strike the right balance in your
programming.
At first you couldn't have cared
less about social niceties like
"please" and "thank you"; you
were... downright rude, in fact.
Data? That's hard to picture --
But the first time we modified
your program we overcompensated;
it made you so obsequious your
Father couldn't stand to be in the
same room with you.
That was nothing compared to the
problems we had --
Never mind. I don't want to
embarrass you.
I am incapable of embarrassment.
Please, continue.
One thing we didn't anticipate was
that you thought nothing of being
naked.
-- some of the colonists objected
to having an anatomically-correct
android running around without any
clothes on.
We asked you to dress, but you
felt it was unnecessary since you
didn't need protection from the
elements. We actually had to
write a modesty sub-routine to get
you to keep your clothes on.
Bridge to Engineering.
LaForge, here. Go ahead,
Commander.
We've established synchronous
orbit over the drilling site.
Phaser modifications are on-line,
sir.
My calculations indicate that the
first phaser blast will be
approximately nineteen seconds in
duration.
Acknowledged.
Someone's checked his
calculations, of course.
No, but I'm sure Data knows what
he's doing.
Even so... he's a machine --
shouldn't someone... check up on
him?
I have complete confidence in his
ability to "check up" on himself.
Mister Worf... ?
Phasers are locked on target.
Fire when ready.
The beam has penetrated eight
kilometers beneath the surface...
Once it's through the crust, we'll
boost phaser intensity by twelve
percent.
Standing by.
Now...
The mantle is less resistant than
I thought it would be --
We are within two kilometers of
the magma pocket.
Another five seconds should do it.
We've broken through --
Terminating beam.
The pocket seems stable...
I detect no increase in stress
levels in the surrounding magma.
Good work. I don't think we could
have gotten in any cleaner.
The drilling process has raised
the temperature inside the magma
pocket by almost three hundred
degrees C. It will be several
hours before it cools enough for
us to enter.
Data, do you have any plans right
now?
I do not.
Maybe we could spend some time
together? I'd love to see your
quarters...
Thank you. I have been practicing
for a recital tomorrow evening.
That was beautiful.
I have been told that my playing
is technically flawless, but it
has never been described as
beautiful.
Well it was... really.
Are you certain that you are not
saying that because you are my
Mother?
I have observed that parents tend
to exaggerate when it comes to
their children's accomplishments.
I suppose there is a certain
amount of vanity involved...
considering that giving you a
creative capacity was my idea.
Your Father didn't really see the
point... he thought that since you
didn't have emotions, you would
have no need to express yourself.
Somehow... I had the feeling the
opposite would be true.
I do not know for certain... but
I believe that it is during my
creative endeavors that I come
closest to experiencing what it
might be like to be human.
Well... I'm glad I insisted.
As am I.
You know, Data... I'm very
familiar with that Handel piece.
How would you feel about my
playing the viola part tomorrow?
I would like that very much.
We should practice -- do you
happen to have a viola?
I can replicate one for you.
Did you paint these?
Yes.
I am attempting to master all
known styles of painting.
This one is in the style of the
early French impressionists...
It's very good.
Who's this?
That is Lal, my daughter.
Your daughter... ?
Yes. I created her... using
myself as a model.
Where is she now?
The positronic matrix I designed
for her was unstable. She only
lived a short time.
I see...
In a sense, you were her
grandmother...
Would you like to practice now?
The acoustics in Ten Forward are
quite favorable.
Yes... very nice...
Data... can I ask you something?
Of course.
Do you think you'll ever try to
create an android again?
Perhaps. I created Lal because I
wished to procreate. Despite what
happened to her, I still have that
wish.
But... how do you know the same
thing won't happen? Creating a
stable positronic matrix is very
tricky -- your Father lost several
prototypes before Lore.
I was not aware that he created
any androids before my brother.
There were three of them... they
were like children to us... losing
them was very painful. When
Noonian decided to try again, I
was very much against it. I
didn't think we had the right to
bring a life into the world that
had so little chance of surviving.
But your Father was sure he'd
figured out what went wrong,
insisted he could make a stable
matrix. And he did.
But Lore was cruel... evil.
Eventually, we had no choice... we
had to dismantle him.
Your father decided to build yet
another android, one who didn't
have emotions -- I couldn't
believe he was going to try again.
After everything that'd
happened...
Mother... I am that android. Are
you saying that you were against
my creation?
Initially I was. But I was wrong;
I know that now.
I've followed your progress for
years -- I'm very proud of what
you've accomplished.
Then... why did you never attempt
to contact me?
Because... I was ashamed... of
something I'd done...
What?
I never wanted you to know this...
I've felt guilty about it for
years...
That's something you don't have to
worry about, do you? Guilt --
eating away at you...
Perhaps if you told me what has
made you feel that way, your guilt
might be alleviated.
I lied when I said there wasn't
room for you in the escape pod
that we took from Omicron... there
was...
I didn't want to bring you with
us... I was afraid that if we reactivated
you, you'd turn out like
Lore.
I made Noonian leave you behind...
We are within four kilometers of
the magma pocket...
Doctor, should we lower the beam
intensity?
Yes -- yes, by sixteen percent...
Acknowledged.
Another twelve seconds should do
it...
We're getting feedback pulses
along the particle beam --
We must have hit a pocket of
magnesite ore -- I'll try to
adjust the phaser harmonics to
compensate.
We're going to have to terminate
the beam if this keeps up --
If we do, we will have to begin a
new shaft at another suitable
location --
There is no other suitable
location -- give me a few more
seconds --
Doctor, it's going to take longer
than that to match the resonant --
You did it --
It was just luck... I hit the
right frequency...
All right, we're less than two
kilometers from the target site --
Stand by to terminate the beam...
We've broken through --
Now --
I am detecting no signs of
instability...
Excellent.
Commander, may I suggest we set up
the infusion unit in the first
magma pocket while we give this
one a chance to cool.
Data, Doctor Tainer -- we'll meet
you in Transporter Room Two.
Acknowledged.
I have initialized the plasma
induction coils.
I'll need another minute to align
the diverter...
There are signs of stress in the
surrounding magma, but the site
should remain stable until we
finish the plasma infusion.
Good, we're almost done here.
Data, Juliana told me what she
said to you last night. She's
been very upset...
I don't blame you for being angry
with her, but --
I am incapable of anger.
There seems to be some... tension
between you...
It's all right, Pran.
I know what I told you must have
been hard for you to hear, but I
hope you can understand my
reasons.
I am not certain that I do.
Perhaps you could clarify them for
me?
I'll try. What do you want to
know?
If I had been your biological
offspring, would you have left me
behind on Omicron Theta?
Oh, Data... how can I answer that?
Doctor Tainer, I have the
impression that you are trying to
spare my feelings. I assure you,
that is not necessary.
I just don't want you to
misunderstand my answer.
No, I wouldn't have left you
behind if you'd been my biological
child.
Is that because you place more
value on biological life than on
artificial life?
Absolutely not. I cherished every
android your father and I created
as if it were my own child. Even
Lore.
Despite the fact that he'd turned
on us, despite everything he'd
done... dismantling him was the
most difficult thing I've ever had
to do in my life. I was afraid
that if you turned out like him...
I'd have to dismantle you, too...
and I couldn't bear that.
I'm not trying to justify leaving
you behind... but I am sorry I
did. I hope you can believe that.
I do. Thank you for making it
clear to me.
Data, I don't think I've ever
heard you play more...
... expressively.
That was wonderful, Doctor.
I enjoyed playing -- it's been a
while.
I see where Data gets his musical
talents.
I realize you're speaking
metaphorically, of course, but
thank you just the same.
Well... that was quite a
performance.
Thank you.
You know, Data... when I found out
you were coming, I didn't know
what to expect. I've never met an
artificial life form before.
But after meeting you, I feel a
lot better. You... you're much
different from how I imagined you.
And I welcome you to our family.
Would you excuse me? There is
something I must do.
Data... why do you need Doctor
Tainer's medical records? Is
something wrong with her?
I am not certain. Perhaps you
could determine that from her
Transporter trace pattern.
I probably could... but I don't
ordinarily look into someone's
medical status unless I have a
good reason.
Doctor... I would ask that you not
require me to be more specific.
But I assure you that I have a
good reason for asking.
All right, Data...
Well... at first glance I don't
see anything wrong -- except for
some mild hypertension, which is
perfectly normal for a woman her
age.
I see.
Maybe you should tell me what her
symptoms are.
She has not complained of any
discomfort.
Then... why did you want to look
at her medical records?
Because... I have reason to
believe she is not who she claims
to be...
Bridge to Data...
Go ahead, Commander...
There's been a cave-in in one of
the magma pockets. You're needed
in Transporter room two.
On my way.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What happened?
We were running a final check on
the infusion unit when part of the
wall gave way...
It looks like the area has
stabilized, but seismic stress is
building up -- eventually, the
pocket will collapse.
How long, Geordi?
It's hard to say... twelve hours
at most.
Then we have to finish configuring
the unit and inject the plasma
immediately.
I'd rather not send anyone back
down there.
If we don't do it now, Commander,
it could take months to find
another suitable site. The core
may have solidified by then.
She's right, we have to act now.
All right. But I want you in and
out of there as quickly as
possible.
Acknowledged, Commander.
You're hurt. I'll go.
One of the transporter's pattern
enhancers was thrown out of
alignment by the seismic activity --
I'm getting a normal power
signature from it so you should be
able to re-align it for the beam
out.
Energize.
There will be more seismic
activity. We must hurry.
The shaft has not been obstructed
by the seismic activity -- it
should be possible to trigger the
unit from orbit.
The infuser's been damaged...
we're going to have to start the
programming sequence all over
again...
Priming the energy transfer
matrix...
Re-intializing the particle stream
buffer...
Riker to Data.
Data, here. Go ahead, Commander.
We're reading an increase in
seismic stress levels.
Understood. We will attempt to
expedite our work.
There... now we just have to align
the diverter and --
Data! Are you all right?
Yes, Commander. We will be
returning to the beam-out point
shortly.
That's it -- let's go.
Can we transport without the
pattern enhancers?
No, we are too far below the
surface.
How are we going to get down
there?
There are no hand-holds in the
rock face.
We will have to jump.
It's too far... I won't make it...
You will --
Basically, she's a Soong-type
android -- except everything about
her is designed to fool you into
thinking she's human.
She's got tear ducts, sweat glands --
even veins and capillaries
underneath her skin.
Why does the scanner read her as
a human?
There's a feedback processor
that's designed to send out a
false bio-signal.
It's tied in with her aging
program -- she not only ages in
appearance, like Data, her vital
signs change too.
What I can't figure out is why she
lost consciousness. As far as I
can see, everything's fine -- she
should be awake.
Check her positronic matrix --
there may be a cascade anomaly.
Data -- you said you knew she was
an android... how?
The first indication occurred when
we were drilling. I saw her
perform several complex
calculations without the
assistance of the computer.
That could just have meant she was
good at math --
That is true. But it was enough
to draw my attention. Later, I
noticed something odd about the
way she blinked her eyes.
The intervals between blinks were
governed by a Fourier Series --
the same mathematical formula my
father used to give my blinking
pattern the appearance of
randomness.
I can't imagine anyone but you
noticing something like that.
Then there was our concert in Ten
Forward.
What about it?
We had practiced the piece, and I
noticed that she played it the
same way during the performance --
every pitch, every intonation, was
exactly the same. Only an
artificial life-form could have
done that.
Does her husband have any idea?
I do not believe so. He is on the
surface, to monitor the plasma
infusion.
That's probably just as well...
Data, take a look at this.
It appears to be an information
module...
With a holographic interface.
Whoever you are, if you're
watching this, you must have found
out about Juliana.
That is correct.
I programmed this hologram to
answer any questions you might
have -- I'm Noonian Soong; I
created her.
I am Data.
Data -- I hoped somehow it might
be you... I even created a
response program to answer your
questions. How are you, boy?
I am fine.
I'm glad you got the chance to
meet your mother.
You refer to Doctor Tainer as my
mother -- yet the complexity of
her design indicates she was
created after I was.
You're right, but there was a real
Juliana O'Donnell. She was my
wife; she helped me create you.
What happened to her?
She was injured when the
Crystalline Entity attacked... we
made it to Terlina Three, but then
she lapsed into a comatose
state...
When I realized nothing could be
done for her, I built an android
and started trying to perfect my
synaptic scanning technique -- so
I could transfer her memories into
a positronic matrix. I didn't
know if it would work, but I had
to try. I couldn't stand the
thought of losing the only woman
I ever loved.
A few days after Juliana died...
I activated the android. She
looked up at me... and she smiled.
She recognized me. It had worked!
Here was a life not two minutes
old, and as far as she knew I was
her husband and she'd just
recovered from a terrible injury.
It was incredible.
And you never told her the truth?
Why? There was no reason for her
to know. I wanted her to be
happy. I wanted us to be happy.
And we were... for a while,
anyway...
What happened?
I made a terrible mistake... I
never really let her know how much
I loved her...
She left me... The real Juliana
probably would've, too, if she'd
lived.
If she recovers and learns that
she is an android --
She doesn't have to know. I
designed her to shut down in the
event the truth was discovered.
When you re-insert the chip,
she'll wake up and remember
nothing. All you have to do is
make up some excuse about what
happened to her.
Then... you do not believe she
should know the truth.
The truth is that in every way
that matters, she is Juliana
Soong.
I've programmed her to terminate
after a long life. Let her live
out the rest of her days, and die
believing she was human. Don't
rob her of that, son. Please.
It seems that I must make a
decision: to tell Doctor Tainer
that she is an android -- or
withhold that knowledge from her.
And I do not know what to do.
Why was Doctor Soong so adamant
that she not be told?
He seemed certain that if she
knew, it would preclude the
possibility of her being happy.
And -- what do you think?
I am not certain.
I can understand why my father
felt as he did -- but his wishes
are not necessarily paramount. I
am concerned with what would be
best for -- my mother.
Wouldn't she be better off knowing
the truth? Dealing with the
reality of her existence?
I don't think so. She's believed
she's human all her life. The
truth might be devastating to her.
I have noticed that her present
husband seems uncomfortable with
the fact that I am an artificial
life-form. If he finds out about
his wife, it may adversely affect
their relationship.
He doesn't have to know -- if you
tell her, it would be up to her
whether or not to tell him.
Data, there might come a time in
the future when she would find out
anyway -- another accident, for
example. Perhaps it would be
easier for her to learn the truth
from you.
I can tell you that if I were in
her place... I'd rather have my
son tell me than some stranger...
I find that I am having difficulty
separating what would be best for
her... from what would be best for
me.
What do you mean?
If she knew she were an android,
she and I would have something to
share. I would no longer be alone
in the universe.
I know how much that would mean to
you... but at the same time,
telling her would rob her of the
one thing you've wanted all your
life -- to be human.
It's a difficult choice.
You must do what you think best,
Data. We will support any
decision you make.
Data... what happened? The last
thing I remember is jumping off
that cliff...
You were knocked unconscious by
the fall... you broke a bone in
your arm, but Doctor Crusher
repaired it.
Everything is fine, Mother.
Captain's Log, supplemental. The
infusion of plasma into the core
of Atrea Four has been
accomplished. Pran Tainer's
projections indicate that the core
will remain molten for several
hundred years.
When will I see you again?
Perhaps I can visit Atrea on my
next leave.
I'd like that very much.
Well... I'd better be going...
Mother... I remembered something
that I thought you should know.
Before he died, my father told me
that he had only one great love in
his life... and that he regretted
never letting her know how much he
cared for her.
I am certain he was referring to
you.
That's nice to know...
On Atrea they have a saying...
that a child born from parents who
love each other will have nothing
but goodness in his heart...
I guess that explains you...
Take care of yourself, son.
Good-bye, Mother.
