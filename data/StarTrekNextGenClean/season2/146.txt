Lookin' good. I say... five.
Five here.
And five more.
I believe the wiser course of
action here is to bend.
You mean fold.
That is correct. Fold -- to bend,
make compact or give in.
I raise fifty.
I do not believe Lieutenant Worf
understands all the nuances of
this betting procedure.
Don't be too quick to judge, Data.
His pile's a lot bigger than
yours.
Than all of ours.
The cards have been favoring the
Lieutenant, but that is the result
of random chance... hence it is
a temporary condition.
You hope.
Talk or play. Not both.
Fifty, right?
Fifty is the bet. What's the
matter -- are your feet getting
cold?
No, just my cards...
Thanks for staying in -- I need
the chips.
Got to earn them first.
Oh, I will. This pot has my name
on it.
Talk, talk, talk...
Here's some action. Fifty...
... and another fifty.
Fold, fold, fold...
Your fifty, and fifty more.
Love to stay in -- but not with
these cards.
Looks like it's just you and me,
handsome.
I'll see you.
Beats my straight.
The Iceman wins again.
You took my last chip. You could
at least smile, Worf.
Smiling might break his
concentration.
If you don't enjoy winning -- what
do you enjoy? Losing?
We'd be happy to accommodate you.
Your deal.
The game is seven card stud; after
the queen, one-eyed jacks and low
card in the hole are wild.
Let me write this down.
Just deal. I'd like to get some
of my losings back before the next
century.
I open with fifty.
Bridge to Commander Riker. We
are receiving a class eleven
emergency signal from Starfleet
Command.
On my way.
Fifty? You were bluffing.
Klingons never bluff.
Mister Data?
Emergency signal reads as follows:
Enterprise to divert to
coordinates four-two-three by
one-one-two by five-one
immediately. Further orders
forthcoming.
That's it? What's the emergency?
The message does not elaborate.
You'd think they'd at least give
us a hint.
Course laid in, Captain.
Warp eight.
Whenever Starfleet gets enigmatic,
I know we're about to face a
challenge.
Engage.
Our destination is a point near
the Boradis system.
That area was colonized fairly
recently, as I recall.
The first Federation outpost was
established thirty-four years ago
on Boradis Three.
And since then, the Federation
has colonized several planets in
that sector.
Yet we are not headed for a
specific colony. The coordinates
given are outside the Boradis
system.
Any problems reported in that
area?
None.
Then what the devil's going on?
Captain, Starfleet Command is
hailing us.
It's about time. On screen.
Greetings, Captain Picard.
My compliments, Admiral Gromek.
Captain, you'll soon be joined
by a Federation special emissary
from Starbase one five three.
We're now transmitting the
specifics.
We are receiving.
The rendezvous will be a bit
tricky, so it's imperative you
reach the intercept point on
schedule.
Understood. And -- the mission?
The envoy will fill you in. You
are to cooperate fully.
Can you give me any details?
Negative.
Admiral, I find it difficult to
prepare for a mission I know
nothing about.
I sympathize, Jean-Luc, but
Starfleet Command considers this
a top-security matter.
After the envoy's briefed you,
I think you'll understand our
caution. Gromek out.
Data, what ship is carrying the
envoy?
The envoy is not aboard a
starship.
Indeed?
Apparently there were no starships
available at Starbase
one five three. The emissary is
aboard a class eight probe.
A class eight probe is just over
two meters long!
True, Number One. But if the
sensors and transmitters were
removed and life-support
installed, there would be just
enough space for one person.
And those probes are designed to
go warp nine.
By sending the probe to meet us
rather than diverting the
Enterprise to the starbase, they
have saved us six point one hours.
Obviously Starfleet feels that
time is of the essence.
Yes, but still... to seal someone
up inside a Class Eight Probe and
then just launch it off...
Hell of a way to transport a
Federation dignitary.
We'll need an intercept course
with pin-point accuracy. The
probe carrying the emissary has
no means of navigation...
... so if we don't catch it on the
first try, we'll have to chase
it.
Data -- if we project our course
past the rendezvous coordinates,
what lies ahead?
As far as I can determine, sir
-- very little. There are four
colonies in the Boradis system,
and nine other outposts scattered
throughout the sector.
Captain, we have a way to save
you some time.
Proceed.
I believe we can beam the probe
aboard while we're still
travelling at Warp Nine.
Quite a trick.
Right -- at warp speed it's
nearly impossible to get a solid
transporter lock. But if we
caught the probe with a tractor
beam...
We could use the tractor beam to
focus the transporter.
Exactly.
Risks?
None to the emissary. There's
a chance the probe could break
free... then we'd have to find
it and start over.
So it's a gamble.
Odds, gentlemen?
Twenty to one it'll work.
Make it so.
Coming to three-one mark one-one-three.
We should now be on a precisely
parallel course with the probe.
Increase to warp eight point nine.
Eight point nine -- aye.
Full sensors, aft.
Scanning...
I have it, sir. Bearing zero-five
mark two-three-one; velocity warp
nine.
I see it.
Adjust speed to intercept.
Probe coming up to starboard,
range eighty-two hundred.
Tractor beam ready.
Mister LaForge?
Transporter ready, Captain.
Range now seventy-five hundred.
Steady as she goes...
Probe is standing abeam.
Engage tractor.
Okay, O'Brien, they've hooked
it -- let's reel it in.
Will do.
Transporter beam locked, Captain.
Energize.
Probe aboard, Captain.
Acknowledged. Number One?
I'll welcome our visitor.
Resume original course and speed.
Aye, sir.
Well done, everyone.
Something wrong, Doctor?
I'm not sure. The readings are
quite... interesting.
I greet you. I am K'Ehleyr.
nuqneH. qaleghneS.
You speak Klingon.
A little. I am Commander Riker,
and this is our chief medical
officer, Katherine Pulaski.
I hope your voyage wasn't too
unpleasant.
Klingons are not supposed to mind
hardship.
Nonetheless -- I'm delighted to
be out of that damned coffin.
I don't blame you.
Not the most luxurious
accommodations Starfleet has to
offer...
Whoever said that getting there
is half the fun never rode in
a class eight probe.
How are you feeling? Your vital
signs are rather atypical for a
Klingon.
No doubt because I am only half
Klingon.
Oh?
Yes. My father was Klingon; my
mother was human.
Captain, I'd like to present
Special Federation Emissary
K'Ehleyr.
Welcome aboard. I'm Jean-Luc
Picard.
Counselor Troi, Lieutenant
Commander Data, and --
Worf! So this is where you've
been hiding. I told you we'd meet
again!
Aren't you going to greet me?
I have nothing to say to you.
Haven't changed a bit, eh? Well,
I missed you, too.
Two days ago, Starbase three three six
received an automated
transmission from a Klingon ship,
the T'Ong.
That ship was sent out over
seventy-five years ago.
When the Federation and the
Klingon Empire were still at
war...
The message was directed to the
Klingon High Command. It said
only that the T'Ong was returning
home and was about to reach the
"awakening point."
Which suggests that the crew was
in cryogenic sleep for most of
the long voyage.
Exactly.
And when the crew is revived...
... we'll have a ship full of
Klingons who think the war is
still going on.
So our task is to find the ship,
and tell the Klingons we are no
longer at war.
Why us? A Klingon ship would have
been a better choice.
A Klingon ship -- the P'rang --
is on its way, but it's two days
behind us. That may be too late.
Why too late?
Because the T'Ong's crew is about
to awaken within striking range
of a dozen Federation outposts.
There are thirteen colonies
with minimal defenses in that
sector...
Nice ripe targets for a Klingon
warship.
And you believe you can convince
these Klingons that humans are
now their allies?
No. Not a chance.
If you ask me, talking will be
a waste of time. Klingons of that
era were raised to despise humans.
We'll try diplomacy. But I
promise you -- it won't work.
And then you'll have to destroy
them.
No.
No? Captain, these Klingons are
killers. You'll have no choice.
Find me another choice. I want
some options -- and I want them
before we encounter the Klingon
ship.
Lieutenant, I'm assigning you to
help the emissary. Dismissed.
I'll escort you to the guest
quarters.
Lieutenant?
Sir... I suggest Commander Riker
or Data would better serve Special
Emissary K'Ehleyr.
Are there personal reasons you
don't want the assignment?
Yes.
Any professional reasons?
No.
I withdraw my request, Captain.
Good.
I didn't know it was possible
for a human and a Klingon to
produce a child.
Actually, the DNA is compatible
-- with a fair amount of help.
Rather like my parents.
I know exactly what you mean.
My father was human... and my
mother was Betazoid.
Really! It was the other way
around for me -- my mother was
human.
You must've grown up like I did
-- trapped between cultures.
I never felt trapped -- I felt
fortunate. I experienced the
richness and diversity of two
worlds.
Perhaps you got the best of
each...
Myself, I think I got the worst
of each.
I doubt that.
Oh, yes. Having my mother's sense
of humor is bad enough -- it's
gotten me into plenty of trouble.
And your Klingon side?
That, I keep under tight control.
It's like a terrible temper --
it's not something I want people
to see.
Why hide it? We all have
tempers...
Not like mine. Sometimes I feel
there's a monster inside me,
fighting to get out.
And that frightens you.
Of course it does. My Klingon
side can be terrifying... even
to me.
Yet it gives you strength. It's
part of you.
That doesn't mean I have to like
it.
You are late.
Sorry. Had to make myself
beautiful.
I fail to understand why.
Worf, we're alone now. You don't
have to act like a Klingon
glacier. I don't bite...
... well, that's wrong; I do bite.
Shall we proceed with our assigned
duties?
I haven't even had a proper
welcome.
I would prefer to keep this
professional.
"I fail to understand why."
And I feel no need to explain.
Oh, go ahead. Tell me. It's
because you find me irresistible,
isn't it? You always have.
Did you come on board the
Enterprise to work, or to discuss
your pointless fantasies?
You just won't open up, will you?
Come on -- what happened to the
Worf I met on Samrin's Planet?
He became a Starfleet lieutenant.
Oh, is that it? Starfleet Academy
turned you into a robot? You
won't make me believe that.
I have no wish to make you believe
anything.
Perhaps you have changed. You
weren't this aloof six years
ago... or don't you remember?
There is nothing wrong with my
memory.
Well, there's something wrong with
the rest of you. You're not even
looking at me.
I am familiar with your
appearance.
And it gives you no pleasure to
see me again?
It isn't as if we tried it and
it didn't work, you know. You
never gave it a chance.
I never?
I mean, as I see it, we have
some... unfinished business, you
and I.
Not as far as I'm concerned.
According to the library computer,
the captain of the T'Ong is
K'Temoc. But there is nothing
regarding the ship's mission.
So?
You're not interested in why the
ship was sent out?
Probably some secret military
objective.
Perhaps, but we have no evidence
of that --
Why else would there be no record
of the mission?
The records may simply have been
lost.
In any case, what does it matter?
Our concern is the present -- the
possible threat.
And to contend with that threat,
we need information.
We have all the information we
need.
That is foolish. Knowing their
mission might help us understand
them --
There's nothing to understand!
They're Klingons! They'll attack!
In their minds, we're the enemy
-- and there's no way we're going
to talk them out of that!
I do not appreciate being
interrupted.
And I don't appreciate wasting
my time.
We were instructed to come up with
options --
There aren't any! The
assignment's hopeless!
There are always options.
Oh, are there? Tell me: whatever
happened to that wonderful
Klingon fatalism of yours?
My experience aboard this ship
has taught me that most problems
have more than one solution.
Starfleet hasn't improved you
one bit. You're as stubborn as
ever!
Are you going to carry out your
duties or aren't you?
All right! I will!
Upon due consideration of the
problem and careful examination
of all possible "options" -- my
original recommendation stands.
Meeting adjourned.
Come.
You're upset.
Really! Your finely-honed
Betazoid sense tells you that?
Well -- that, and the table.
I warned you about my Klingon
half.
May I make a suggestion?
I thank you, Counselor. But I
don't want any counseling.
Actually, I was going to suggest
something else.
Oh?
I find the Holodeck exercise
programs rigorous enough to put
my mind off most frustrations.
And it'll keep me from wrecking
the ship.
That, too...
Enter program.
Show me the exercise menu.
Calisthenics program of Lieutenant
Worf.
Program complete. You may enter
when ready.
Status.
Based on the last assumed position
of the Klingon vessel, its
apparent trajectory, and our
estimates of their cruising speed,
we should be in scanner range in
fifteen hours, eight minutes.
Lieutenant?
Special Emissary K'Ehleyr has...
declared a short recess, sir.
I wish to run a full diagnostic
test on all tactical back-up
equipment.
We just ran a full test of those
systems.
I feel it necessary to check them
again.
Lieutenant, I commend your
diligence. However, I'm concerned
that you're working yourself too
hard.
Sir, considering the unknown
elements we are about to face --
Lieutenant -- I order you to
relax.
I am relaxed.
Yes, sir.
I've never seen the Lieutenant
so... unsettled.
The Iceman's finally melting.
It's not much of a program.
Computer. Level Two.
Some calisthenics programs are
better than others.
You can still make jokes?
Of course I can. I still have
enough energy for that...
You're not laughing.
You are most observant.
You don't like people with a sense
of humor?
I did not say that.
Worf, you're the perfect Klingon
-- the ultimate minimalist. Talk
to me!
I've noted that some people use
humor as a shield... they talk
much yet say little.
Whereas others take a simpler
approach -- say nothing.
When one does not have the
words...
Or is loath to speak them...
Fortunately, there are other ways
to communicate.
Why didn't we do this six years
ago?
We were not ready.
I was...
We were both too young -- too
unaware. We lacked commitment.
Perhaps we lacked courage as well.
No longer.
tlhIngan jIH.
Wait. You can't mean -- You're
not --
We have mated.
Yes, I know -- I was there.
But...
And now we must solemnize our
union with the oath --
Like hell we must!
-- and pledge that we are one
forever.
I'm not going to become your
wife...
You already are.
Don't give me that Klingon
nonsense.
You would dishonor our sacred
traditions?
They're not sacred -- they're
absurd! Marrying you is out of
the question for a million
reasons...
None of which stopped you earlier.
Worf, it was what it was!
Glorious and wonderful and all
that, but it doesn't mean
anything.
That is a human attitude.
I am human!
You are also Klingon!
And that means we should bond for
life?
It is our way!
Yours -- not mine!
tlhIngan jIH!
I will not take the oath!
Then this night had no meaning!
And that, I will not believe.
Believe what you will...
Exit.
Approaching the coordinates.
Slow to impulse.
Short and long-range sensor scans
negative, Captain.
Lay in a standard search pattern.
Search pattern laid in.
Full impulse. Engage.
I just hope we find them before
they come out of their nap.
Agreed. No outpost in this sector
could defend itself against a
Klingon warship.
I've been working on our
assignment... trying a few
computer simulations.
Your devotion to duty is
commendable... if belated.
So far, I'm having no success.
I could use some help.
I am here to assist you.
Unwilling to be alone with me?
I've asked Lieutenant Commander Data to 
help us analyze the alternatives.
An android chaperone?
"Android" is, of course, correct,
but I fail to see how "chaperone"
is applicable in this situation...
Never mind. Come on in.
I guess I can't blame you.
Tell me one thing.
You would have gone through with
the oath, wouldn't you?
Regardless of the consequences
to our careers -- to our lives?
Honor demanded no less.
I'm sick to death of Klingon
"honor." What do you want? Is
honor all you care about? Don't
you feel anything else?
No comment, huh?
Poor android. Which behavior do
you find more perplexing -- human
or Klingon?
At the moment, I would be hard
pressed to choose.
So would I.
Okay. When we locate the T'Ong,
there are two possibilities.
First --
-- we find the ship before it
reaches the "awakening point."
In that case, we could simply keep
the crew asleep.
Is that feasible?
We can beam an away team onto the
T'Ong and override the cryogenic
controls.
Then we await the arrival of the
Klingon ship P'rang...
... so that when the T'Ong's crew
awakens, they're surrounded by
their fellow Klingons.
That would be ideal.
But there's the second
possibility... that the crew of
the T'Ong has already revived.
They discover they're in
Federation territory -- and they
attack the nearest outpost.
Are we sure they'll attack?
We don't even know what the
T'Ong's mission was.
It may have been a scientific
voyage.
Klingons of that period -- doing
research for its own sake?
The point is, they may not be
warlike.
The point is that this is beside
the point. These are Klingons...
at war with us. Whatever their
mission was -- once they see a
Federation target, they'll attack.
Could the T'Ong be disabled rather
than destroyed?
We could probably knock out their
warp engines without damaging the
rest of their ship...
That would gain you nothing.
Disable the ship, and K'Temoc will
destroy it himself.
Klingons do not surrender.
Face it -- if we don't reach the
T'Ong before its crew wakes up,
you have no alternatives.
I will not accept that. There
must be a way to make the Klingons
listen. If we can only convince
them --
Captain, we have detected a ship,
bearing three-one-six mark
forty-two, extreme sensor range.
Plot an intercept course. And
go to Yellow Alert.
Shields are up.
Better lock on phasers. This may
be the only chance you get.
Intercept course laid in.
Hold this position. Let's see
if they've spotted us.
Magnification one hundred.
Mister Data?
Sensors show lifeforms aboard,
sir, but I am unable to ascertain
if they are awake or dormant.
However, the vessel's propulsion
systems are inactive, so I would
hypothesize that the crew is
asleep --
However, I could be in error.
Shields holding.
They've cloaked themselves.
Well, Captain -- you had your
chance.
Transfer Engineering to bridge.
Can you find them?
I think so. Those old shields
weren't a hundred percent
efficient at blocking gamma-ray
output. If I can tune the sensors
to a particular band of...
There! Got 'em! Transferring
coordinates to helm...
Intercept. Warp two.
Warp two, sir.
Captain -- let them die like
Klingons... in battle. They
deserve that much.
Captain... I have another option.
The T'Ong has changed course to
three-two mark eight-one. They
are increasing to warp three.
Standard evasive maneuver.
Helm -- stay with them.
Yes, sir.
The T'Ong is now on a heading of
four-one mark one-one-three...
accelerating to warp five.
They're making a break for it.
Overtake. Warp eight.
Aye.
Put us right in their path and
come to a full stop.
Full power to shields.
Full power, sir.
We've thrown down the gauntlet...
let's see if they pick it up.
They are slowing to impulse --
Phaser hit on forward shields.
No damage.
The T'Ong is attempting to flank
us.
Compensate.
Photon torpedo hit. Shield number
two weakened... firming up now...
No damage.
I think we've piqued their
curiosity by now...
Agreed. Let's give them the
chance to look their enemy in the
face.
Ready, Lieutenant?
Open a hailing frequency.
Hailing frequency open, sir.
What --
Captain K'Temoc -- have you lost
your mind? Halt your ship and
drop your shields.
What treachery is this? By whose
authority?
I am Worf, commanding the
Enterprise. It is you who have
committed an act of treason --
by firing upon this ship.
I have standing orders to fire
on all Federation ships. We are
at war.
You fool. Did it not occur to
you that the war would be over
by now?
I have no proof of that.
Trust your eyes! Or is your brain
still stuck in its long slumber?
How can I be sure this is not a
Federation trick?
Captain, as you are new to this
century, I have tried to be
patient. But I will tolerate no
further insubordination. Drop
your shields immediately.
And if I refuse?
Then die in ignorance. I can
waste no more time on you.
Phasers to full power.
Aye, sir.
Phasers ready. Target locked.
You dare not destroy us. We have
been on a crucial mission by order
of the Klingon High Command...
Has the T'Ong dropped its shields?
No, sir.
Very well. Fire all phasers --
Wait!
Lower the shields.
I yield command of the T'Ong to
you, Captain Worf. Long live the
Klingon Empire.
A wise decision, Captain.
Commander K'Ehleyr will board your
ship and take command. The
Klingon cruiser P'rang will soon
arrive and escort you home.
And, Captain --
Yes?
Welcome to the twenty-fourth century.
I return command of the ship to
you, Captain.
Thank you and congratulations,
Lieutenant. A very fine first
command. Well done.
That's all, Worf? Just a nod?
How did you like command?
Comfortable chair.
One to beam aboard the T'Ong.
All set.
I relieve you.
Yes, Lieutenant.
The Klingon vessel P'rang will
rendezvous with you in three days.
In the meantime, I'll begin the
assimilation of these Klingons
to our era.
Is there anything else you
require?
No. Nothing else.
Damn you, Worf. You'd let me go
without saying another word,
wouldn't you?
What needs to be said?
Nothing. Everything. We're about
to go our separate ways again.
And that disturbs you?
Yes, it does.
I hid the truth from you. Last
night did have meaning.
I was tempted to take the oath
with you. That scared me. I've
never had such strong feelings
toward anyone.
Nor have I.
Then it was more than just a point
of honor.
Maybe someday, when our paths
cross again, I won't be as easy
to get rid of.
K'Ehleyr... I will not be complete
without you.
