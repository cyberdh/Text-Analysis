Ship's log, stardate 42625.4,
First Officer Riker reporting.
We have achieved orbit around
Theta Eight...
... the planet furthest from its
sun in this previously unmapped
solar system. It is a world of
ruthless realities: particularly
harsh, barren, and inhospitable...
Our reason for being here -- a
passing Klingon cruiser reported
discovering pieces of a strange
vessel in the upper atmosphere.
We've come to investigate...
Nasty. Nitrogen... methane...
liquid neon. Surface temperature
minus two hundred and ninety-one
degrees Fahrenheit. Winds up to
three hundred and twelve meters
per second.
Not exactly a vacation planet,
eh?
Uh uh. Not unless you like
ammonia tornadoes. Or orange
lightning bolts for that matter.
Not my cup of tea. Found anything
artificial in the atmosphere?
Nothing so far. We're just coming
around to the night side now.
Keep me informed. The sooner we
identify what the Klingons think
they saw, the sooner we can get
the hell out of here.
Sounds good to me.
Nasty.
Come.
Fermat's last theorem. Familiar
with it?
No. I'm afraid I spent too many
math classes daydreaming about
being on a starship.
It's intriguing. When Fermat died
they found scrawled in the margin
of his notes that he had found
a "remarkable proof."
Unfortunately he never lived to
write it down. And for the last
eight hundred years people have
been trying to rediscover it.
And that includes you?
I find the process relaxing.
We've detected debris of some sort
in a loose orbit.
Can you identify?
I suggest we beam a section aboard
for analysis.
Make it so, Number One.
Energize.
We've locked onto something with
markings on it.
What sort of markings?
Uncertain, sir.
There's something here.
That symbol... Do you recognize
it?
Yes sir. I -- I think I do.
Metallic analysis bears out that
the object in question was
terrestrial in origin. Most
likely late twenty-first century.
But that's not possible. No ship
of that time period could have
come this far.
Nevertheless, that is what our
tests indicate. And the markings
we discovered are consistent with
this hypothesis.
Any idea what destroyed it? An
explosion of some sort?
Unknown.
The question is, how did it get
here?
Captain. We've detected a large
structure on the planet.
It is a building of some sort,
situated on a plane of frozen
methane, smack in the middle of
a tremendous storm belt. It is
incongruous; it simply should not
be there!
Are you certain it's artificially
constructed?
Absolutely. The structure is
surrounded by breathable air.
It's hard to accept...
Yet it does seem to be down there.
Is there a connection between the
structure and the ship?
Suggestions?
Only one, sir. Suggest we go down
and have a look.
Form an away team, minimal
complement.
Let's see if we can find the
architects.
Give me a moment, gents. We're
dealing with an extremely narrow
access point.
We're ready when you are...
Phasers on stun.
Energize.
Where are we?
Exactly where Geordi said we would
be. The structure is directly
behind us.
I am detecting vast ammonia storms
raging mere kilometers away. Yet
they do not appear to penetrate
this breathable zone.
It's like the eye of a hurricane.
It is here. It must be here, yet
we cannot see it.
Enterprise, this is Commander
Riker. We have arrived in a very
unusual place... it is like being
in the eye of a hurricane. It
is completely calm, no sound, no
movement, yet a few meters away
a storm, which we can neither see
nor hear, is raging.
Describe the structure.
We can't see it.
Commander, over here. I see
something!
What is this thing?
What is it, Commander?
I think it's a door. An antique.
Judging by its location, it may
be an entrance to the structure
we seek.
Well... this is what we came here
for.
Captain, we are entering the
structure.
Riker to Enterprise. We have
entered the structure.
We're not getting through.
Where's that interference
originating?
From the source, sir. Cause...
unknown.
Lock onto the landing party.
Have the Transporter Room prepare
to beam them up.
We can't distinguish them as long
as they're inside that structure.
Can they hear us?
We've got to recalibrate all
frequencies.
Make it so.
Without radio contact, we should
leave immediately.
Agreed. We'll make a preliminary
sweep of this environment and then
return.
Checking in, gentlemen? You'll
have to go to the front desk.
Welcome, gentlemen. Have a nice
trip?
Uh... Do you know us?
We've been expecting you. A trio
of foreign gentlemen.
We're from the United Federation
of Planets --
Of course. Welcome to The Hotel
Royale...
Did Rita call?
No -- and for your own good you
had better quit thinking about
Rita.
I'm not afraid of him.
Then you're a fool. Everybody
with any sense is afraid of Mikey
D.
If Rita calls -- you let me know.
The kid's just askin' for trouble
-- Rita's too much for him to
handle, and Mikey D will plant
his face in the pavement.
Now, here are your room keys and
some complimentary casino chips.
Enjoy!
What is this place? How did a
being like you get here?
Why this is the Royale, of
course. And my personal life is
really none of your business,
thank you.
What he means is, what planet
is this?
I beg your pardon?
This planet. What do you call
it?
Earth.
What do you call it?
We call it Theta Eight.
How charming.
Commander...
Yes Data?
None of these people... are
emitting life signs.
You mean they're not alive?
Then what are they?...
These beings... are they machines,
or mere illusions, designed to
deceive us?
Not illusions, Lieutenant. They
do exist, but they do not register
as either man or machine.
For example, this creature
exhibits no DNA structure.
Look who's talkin'.
He sounds just like my ex-wife.
Aaaaall right!! Time to get back
to business!
What sort of business do you
suppose he is getting down to?
Status report?
We're attempting to employ
alternate encoding schemes.
There are hundreds of possible
combinations, Captain.
Is there an intelligence causing
the interference?
Impossible to tell, Captain.
You're new around here, aren't
you?
Yes. I have certainly never
visited this place, or its true
counterpart, before.
Sit down, boy. I'll show you how
this game is played.
Go ahead. Ante up.
It seems he expects something of
me.
He wants you to cut the cards.
Ah, is this poker?
No, it's blackjack.
Also known as twenty-one, a
number which defines the object
of the game. Tens and picture
cards are worth ten, ace -- one
or eleven -- the other cards face
value. The dealer must hit
seventeen -- five cards under pays
double.
Not at this joint -
Run 'em, boy. And make 'em
friendly. There's no bread in
the house.
Aren't you going to look at your
hand?
Poor girl needs to win.
Fifteen - do I hit, Texas, or
stand?
If you've got to win -- then you've
got to hit.
Hit me.
Damn!
Hit me.
Twenty-one -- a winner.
Having fun, Data?
Fun, sir? While there is a
certain amount of enjoyment
involved I was mainly conducting
research into --
-- Save it, Data. We're getting
out of here.
Understood, sir.
Hey, you're holding up the game.
Our apologies. Come on, Data.
Try it again.
Sir, there is no other exit point.
Unless we can find another way...
it seems we are trapped here.
Captain's log, supplemental. We
remain in orbit around Theta
Eight, still out of contact with
the away team.
Phasers are totally ineffective
on all surfaces.
I am checking options... they
seem quite limited --
We don't have any. If we're ever
going to get out of here, we'll
have to do it on our own.
I'm going to get some answers out
of that desk clerk...
Are you crazy?
Wrong. I'm finally getting some
smarts --
You think you're gonna scare Mikey
D with that thing?
I'm gonna make him leave Rita
alone.
Kid, she's a big girl... and she's
Mikey D's girl.
Not any more. Not after tonight.
Look. I like you. I don't want
to see you get hurt... especially
over some dame --
Don't call her that!
You'll see! You'll see how tough
Mikey D is! He's nothin'!
I want some answers!
The concierge can help you with
any --
We want out of here. Now.
I'm afraid you've missed your
check-out time. We do have our
rules, you know.
I mean out of the building. We
want to get outside --
The Royale's exits are clearly
marked.
That's not good enough.
If you have a complaint about the
service you've received during
your stay, you can always take
it up with the manager.
Fine! I'd like to see him
immediately!
I'm afraid the manager is very
busy.
... Riker, can you read me?
Yes, go ahead.
Enterprise?... Enterprise?...
... Enterprise...
Why haven't you left the
building, Number One?
... Tried... Trapped here... No
immediate danger...
Something at your location is
interfering with our exchange...
Working on the problem...
These frequencies aren't
working.
Then find another.
Yes sir.
What is going on down there?
Commander... I am picking up
something most unusual in another
section of this structure.
Indications of DNA.
Where?
Thirty-one point nine meters
above and to the right of us.
Perhaps those turbolifts could
take us there.
The reading I got is behind this
door.
My reading is intensifying.
Life signs?
None.
Definitely human. Male.
Looks like the poor devil died
in its sleep.
What a terrible way to go.
He has been dead for two hundred
eighty-three years. The lack of
any advanced decomposition is
attributable to the sterile
environment.
Commander, look here.
Is that... this "Las Vegas" you
spoke about?
I believe that's what the
illusion is meant to be.
Why would anyone go to all this
trouble? It's all just... window
dressing for a dead man.
Is this significant, sir?
American. Fifty-two stars -- that
would date it between 2053 and
2079 A.D.
Colonel S. Richey.
Rest in peace, Colonel.
Picard to Riker.
Finally.
Riker. Go ahead.
What's your situation?
We are locked in a structure made
to resemble twentieth century
Earth -- all efforts to exit have
failed.
We can't transport.
I assumed as much. Captain, we
have located the remains of a
human.
Request identity scan on a
Colonel Richey, American, first
initial S., roughly same time
period.
We also need a computer library
check on hotel known as the
Royale; possible location, Las
Vegas, Nevada, circa twenty-first
century.
Get on it.
Information retrieved, Captain --
Colonel Stephen Richey was the
commanding officer of the
explorer ship Charybdis which
had a terrestrial launch date of
7-23-2067. It was the first
manned attempt to travel beyond
the confines of the Euclidian
solar system. Its telemetry
system failed and it was never
heard from again...
Why is this of interest, Number
One?
The frequency scramble remains
unpredictable, sir...
Commander? Some curiosities...
Books... A novel...
"The Royale Hotel"...
Summarize.
The story of a group of compulsive
gamblers caught up in the web of
crime, corruption and deceit spun
by nefarious lothario Mikey D who
appears only at the climax to be
brought to his knees by a
heartbroken bellboy. There is
a subplot about an older man
conspiring with a younger woman
to murder her husband while
squandering her inheritance. The
writing is elementary, the
plotting predictable, the
characters one-dimensional. The
only thing of interest, quite
honestly, is the intriguing
setting, that of a Las Vegas
gambling casino-hotel --
This novel... and everyone in
it you've just described...
that's this hotel...
This... this appears to be a
diary... but with only one
entry...
"I write this in the hope that
it will someday be read by human
eyes... I can only surmise at this
point, but apparently our
exploratory shuttle was
contaminated by an alien life-form
which infected and killed all
personnel except myself. I
awakened to find myself here in
The Royale Hotel... and for the
last thirty-eight years I have
survived here.
"I have come to understand that
this place was created for me
out of some sense of guilt,
presuming that the novel we had
on board was in fact a guide to
our preferred lifestyle and social
habits. Obviously, they thought
this was the world from which I
came. I hold no malice toward
my benefactors... they could not
possibly know the hell they have
put me through, for it was such
a badly written book, filled with
endless cliche and shallow
characters. I shall welcome death
when it comes... "
Then that is why... all of this
is here. But why can't we get
out?
Suppose we phaser a slice in the
field which surrounds the
structure?
Yes...
That would mean the atmosphere
of the planet would instantly rush
in.
How long would they live under
those conditions?
A minute -- maybe less.
But you could revive them.
Well, that would depend on how
long they were exposed, how soon
I got to them, but Captain
realistically... I wouldn't give
them much of a chance. I'm a
doctor -- not a magician.
I understand the risk, but I will
not warp off and leave them.
Make your preparations.
Yes, sir.
Yes?
There is a female voice asking
if we want... "room service."
I believe they are asking if we
want the room cleaned.
Tell them no.
No.
What'd she say?
She said... "The kitchen's open
twenty-four hours if we change
our minds."
I'm going to explore the other
floors; you two go down to the
lobby, see if we've missed
anything. Talk to the other
"guests" -- try and find out who
and what they are.
I suggest we separate and blend
in with these beings. Casual
queries offered in an
inconspicuous manner might prove
most fruitful.
What?
Mingle, Worf. Mingle.
How much do I have left?
Honey, it's bad luck to count your
chips at the table...
If I might inquire, where are you
from, sir?
Lubbock, Texas.
How did you get here?
To Vegas? Drove. Got a
ninety-six caddy with only eighty
thousand miles on her.
And where is your automobile now?
Hit?
It's out front, I suppose. What
the hell difference does it make?
Could you take me there?
I'm losing my shirt here --
Now son, why would I wanna do
that? Can't you see I'm tryin'
to to help this little lady?
I do not believe you could go to
your car, even if it truly exists.
You are trapped inside the Royale,
just as I am.
Sure does feel that way when
you're losin', doesn't it? But
right now we're tryin' to turn
this lady's wagon and win back
some lost change. Otherwise she's
goin' to be in a desperate
situation with nowhere to turn.
Well, almost nowhere.
I stay, right?
I wouldn't.
The odds favor standing pat.
What do I do?
You want a card or what?
Too many.
That's everything I had. I've
lost it all. What am I going to
do?
There, there...
You were told.
It's not for you to make the
call... it's for Rita.
She sent me to tell you.
Boys -- we can't afford to have
any trouble here -- take it
outside.
Yeah -- I like that... come on,
baggage man... let's you and me
take it outside.
Watch yourself.
Don't worry.
It's all part of the novel. Don't
interfere.
You should have listened, kid
no woman is worth dying for...
killing for... but not dying for.
How can he leave?
It is on page 244.
The book... Then... how does it
end?
A bad love affair ends in a bloody
shoot-out, the hotel gets bought
out and life goes on... such as
it is --
The hotel gets bought? By whom?
It is not very specific. The
acquiring party is simply referred
to as "foreign investors." Sale
price, twelve point five million.
That's how we're getting out.
We're buying this place.
Number One... If we don't take
some action, make some attempt -- however
dangerous it may be -- to
rescue you, you may very
well be lost to the confines of
that conundrum for all eternity.
That is certain death for you
all... and that...
... that is unacceptable! We
have set phaser focus with energy
ratios sufficient to penetrate
the structure --
Hold on that. There may be
another way. I'll keep you
informed.
It is a question of decimal
percentages. Quite simple, really
if one bets with any sequential
consistency.
Can you do it?
Certainly.
C'mon, sugar, seven-come-eleven
and we're on easy street --
Snake eyes.
I'm almost broke!
Baby, relax! It's only money --
But if I lose it all, I won't
even have a place to sleep.
Don't worry your pretty little
head. I'd never let that happen.
It's your roll, sir...
Go to work.
Maybe this turkey'll change our
luck --
Six. The point is six --
Six! Hell, my blind grandmother
can make a six! Let 'er rip, boy!
Seven. Seven and out...
So much for your new turkey --
These cubes are improperly
balanced. I believe that their
final resting position is
adversely affected --
Loaded dice.
Can you... "repair" them?
I believe so...
Seven! A winner!
Attaboy! Just do that a few more
times and everybody's gonna get
well --
Who has the dice?
Oh, Tex, darlin', you're
brilliant!
Yeah. An' good lookin' too, huh?
Isn't that enough?
Almost. I don't want to be short,
that's for sure...
You are keeping count?
Eleven point three million.
Perhaps I will bet it all --
No! Simply reach twelve million.
As you wish...
The man has the touch.
Now.
I would like to cash out, please.
I'm afraid you've broken the bank.
That's over twelve million --
Twelve point five million to be
exact. The purchase price of
this hotel.
That's impossible --
Wrong. We're the "foreign
Investors" on page 244. We're
buying you out, lock, stock, and
barrel.
Consider it a "done deal."
Hey, y'know what? Y'all got
style! I like that! Let me buy
y'all a drink --
Enjoy the game, friend. And don't
let 'em change the dice on you.
Wait! You can't leave!
Oh yeah? Watch us.
Don't forget, we own the joint.
You're confident about this,
Commander?
Focus. Concentrate. See only
where we want to BE, not where
we are.
Ancient philosophical overtones
of thought process... "Zen", I
believe --
We own the place... and we're
walking through that door...
I think it's time to go home...
Transporter Room, we have a fix
on our away team. Beam them up...
and please be quick about it!
