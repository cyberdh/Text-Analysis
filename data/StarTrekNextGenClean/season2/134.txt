We are approaching Starbase
one-seven-nine.
Half impulse, Mister Crusher.
Going to half impulse.
Captain, this is the bridge. We
have arrived at Starbase
one-seven-nine.
Acknowledged, Number One.
Establish position -- zero-nine-zero mark
three-seven-five -- at
twenty-seven thousand
kilometers.
Aye, sir.
Open hailing frequencies,
Lieutenant.
Hailing frequencies open.
Starbase one-seven-nine, this is
the USS Enterprise.
Enterprise, this is Starbase
one-seven-nine. We are ready for
transfer on your mark.
Thank you.
Commander Data, you have the
bridge. Ensign Crusher, you will
accompany me.
Starbase one-seven-nine. We are
ready to commence transfer.
Acknowledge Enterprise. Begin
transfer.
This is my last chance to say that
it has been a pleasure to serve
with you and to wish you luck on
your new assignment. You have
served the Enterprise well.
No tears, please.
Energize.
Enterprise ready. Beam aboard.
Welcome aboard the Enterprise.
I'm Commander William Riker, your
first officer. Those of you who
are here as replacements will step
outside and Lieutenant Lewis will
assign you to crew quarters.
Ensign, you are here on the
exchange program, you'll follow
Mister Crusher.
Mordoc, what are you doing here?
You couldn't have graduated from
the Academy already.
I am not Mordoc. I am Mendon.
Ensign Mendon of the planet
Benzar.
I'm sorry sir. I thought you were
a friend... Mordoc...
... You look just like him.
We are from the same
geostructure. Naturally we look
alike.
How do you tell each other apart?
We just do.
Well, nice to have you here
Ensign. There will be a
briefing and indoctrination
session as soon as you settle in.
I want to tell you how happy I
am to be assigned to the
Enterprise. It wasn't just luck.
I requested it. I know I can
be of great help to the ship.
Yes, of course. Now if you'll
just follow Ensign Crusher.
Yes sir.
Commander Riker, report to the
Phaser Range, please...
On the way.
I was wondering if you had any
feelings about the Officer
Exchange Program that has been
initiated by Starfleet Command.
Just positive ones sir. I've
already welcomed Ensign Mendon
on board and he certainly seems
eager to please.
That's a Benzite trait.
It's been suggested that one of
the officers on the Enterprise
might like to participate in this
exchange program.
Probably a good idea.
There's a Klingon vessel in the
vicinity.
I don't recall ever hearing of
a Federation officer serving on
a Klingon vessel.
Neither have I.
It could be beneficial.
Having Worf on board certainly
has been.
Yes sir, that's true.
Who did you intend to send?
I was going to ask for a
volunteer.
I wouldn't mind, sir.
What was that, Number One?
I said I wouldn't mind the
assignment.
Any particular reason?
Because nobody has ever done it
before.
I'll notify starbase of your
acceptance... They'll contact the
Klingon vessel and make the
arrangements.
Captain's log, stardate 42606.5.
I have informed the staff of
Commander Riker's temporary duty
assignment and we have departed
from Starbase one-seven-nine and
are headed for a rendezvous with
the Klingon vessel, the Pagh.
I have studied and know everything
about my heritage.
Then you are the one to fill me
in on something that I'm not
clear about.
It's my understanding that one
of the duties of the first officer
on a Klingon ship is to
assassinate the captain.
Yes sir.
Wouldn't that bring about chaos?
Of course not. When and if the
captain becomes weak and unable
to perform, it is expected that
his honorable retirement should
be assisted by his "first."
The second officer would
assassinate you for the same
reasons.
This method of attrition could
take a little getting used to.
The Klingon system has operated
successfully for centuries.
It is different.
Many things will be different.
That's a wonderful method of
maintaining a constant control
factor over defensive shields,
but I'm sure there's a way to
improve response time.
Oh, sorry, didn't mean to
interrupt you... Just thought I
could be of some help, however
I am correct in what I said.
That is superb designing,
absolutely first rate.
Yes it is. Would you care to
be more specific?
The input sampling. It's simple
yet efficient enough. Of course
a minor change of the helm
readout would be much more
helpful in emergency situations.
We've never had any trouble with
it. Have you seen it work?
Not in a practical exercise, but
in theory... my theory... it would
be more than a marginal
improvement. I'll have to mention
this to the captain.
You're going to advise Captain
Picard?
Captain Picard... I'll have to
discuss these improvements with
him.
He is open to some astute
observations, isn't he?
Well, I've never heard Captain
Picard refuse to listen to his
officers.
Outstanding! Pretty soon we'll
get things running perfectly.
What is this?
A Klingon delicacy. That's heart
of targ -- this is pipius claw.
And this is stewed "gagh."
"Gagh"?
Serpent worms... would you like
to know how they're prepared?
No thanks. I've never heard of
a Klingon starving to death on
one of their own vessels, but you
might.
Not if I weaken first.
I know all about that. Their
beliefs may be somewhat brutal
but usually what kills us, kills
them.
That's something to look forward
to. Would you like a drink,
Doctor?
I'm abstaining in honor of your
last hour on board.
Your sacrifice will not go
unnoticed.
I understand the theory of the
feast before the transfer. I've
done the same thing dozens of
times. However, I usually made
more civil choices.
These are the most civil choices.
I see... Well, their food may be
somewhat backward but the Klingons
are efficient, loyal to their
beliefs, and are regulated by a
strict code of ethics.
True enough. They tend to lean
towards a Samurai civilization
that is thousands of years old.
But they are pure in that
tradition.
This is a great opportunity,
Number One. We really know so
little about them. We have so
much to learn.
I think I envy you, Will Riker.
An emergency transponder?
Slightly altered to transmit an
omnidirectional signal and an
emergency call.
Are you sensing some trouble
that I don't?
Simply a security precaution.
I want to insure your return to
this ship.
Sentiment, Lieutenant Worf?
Efficiency, Commander.
I understand. Thank you,
Lieutenant.
We have a Klingon vessel
approaching.
Hailing frequencies open.
They are returning our hail in
proper language. It is the Pagh.
On viewscreen.
I am Jean-Luc Picard, captain of
the Enterprise.
And I am Captain Kargan of the
Pagh. Beam your first officer
on board immediately.
We are preparing to do so.
You're getting a good man,
Captain Kargan.
Thank you for your opinion but
I will judge that for myself.
Screen off.
Not very hospitable are they?
That is not your concern. Observe
your station, Ensign Mendon.
Didn't mean to offend you.
You didn't...
... Yet.
Transporter Room, prepare to beam
Commander Riker aboard the Pagh.
Ready, Captain.
Good Luck, Commander.
Thank you sir.
On your command, Will.
Energize.
Viewscreen off. Resume course.
Aye sir.
Take over Commander Data, I'll
be in my quarters.
Yes sir.
Sir, I'm Ensign Mendon. I just
wanted to tell you how pleased
I am to be aboard the Enterprise.
Yes, of course. Nice to have you
on board.
If you have a few minutes I've
noted a few procedural items that
could speed up operations on the
bridge.
I pick things up very quickly.
I'm sure you do Ensign, you
have an excellent record.
However, on the Enterprise we use
the chain of command. You may
report your observations to
Lieutenant Worf.
I didn't mean to challenge your
authority...
... I just wanted to impress upon
you...
No need to apologize Ensign...
we should have explained it better
during indoctrination.
Ensign Mendon... You may impress
me.
Something wrong?
No, Commander.
It's just I have never seen anyone
of your species before...
I'm just your average everyday
human who happens to be a
commander. Now what are your
orders?
I am to escort you to the captain.
Proceed.
I am Commander William Riker of
the Starship Enterprise.
That is incorrect.
I don't understand.
You are Commander Riker, first
officer of the Klingon Cruiser
Pagh, or do you intend to
disobey Federation orders?
I have no such intentions,
Captain.
Exactly where are your loyalties,
Commander?
I'm afraid I still don't
understand.
This ship is equipped with our
best weapons and our finest
warriors. Although we are on a
peaceful mission we are prepared
to go into battle instantly. I
know I can count on every Klingon
warrior in this crew to serve and
die in that battle. So I ask
again Commander Riker,
where are your loyalties?
I have been assigned here to serve
this ship and to obey your orders.
I will do exactly that.
Will you take an oath to that
effect?
I just did.
yI-Har-Qo! nep-we' ghaH! (Do
not believe him! He lies!)
Hol-chaj yI-jatlh. (Speak in
their language.)
This is your second officer,
Lieutenant Klag.
Was there something you wanted
to say to me, Lieutenant?
Yes sir.
I don't believe you.
Then I take it you challenge my
authority over you.
Correct.
And your position in this,
Captain?
I would call it your first command
decision.
My oath is between Captain Kargan
and myself. Your only concern
is how to obey my orders.
Or do you prefer the rank of
prisoner over that of lieutenant?
I will take your orders.
And you, Commander Riker, will
obey my orders.
Agreed, Captain Kargan.
Sir, the automatic scan has
registered some unknown substance
on the aft quarter of the exterior
skin of the dorsal fin.
Zero in on that location and
define.
I've located it sir. The dorsal
of the Engineering Section.
On viewscreen. Focus on area.
Magnification factor ten.
Increase magnification to
twenty.
Analyze.
The substance appears to be a rare
form of subatomic "bacteria,"
capable of doubling every fifteen
minutes. It seems to be reacting
with two of the compounds present
in the Enterprise structure.
Determine origin.
I noticed it when I did an
intensive scan of the Pagh,
the Klingon ship.
And you informed no one?
I have not yet completed my full
analysis.
You are supposed to report
whatever is out of the ordinary.
This falls into that category.
But sir, as I said I have not yet
completed my analysis. It would
be improper to report it until
then.
How did you come by that
decision?
It is a Benzite regulation. No
officer on the deck of one of our
ships would report an occurrence
like this until he had a full
analysis and a resolution.
I have simply followed proper
procedures.
It is our procedure for you to
bring to the attention of command
any possibility of danger. You
will not make those decisions.
Is that clear, Ensign Mendon?
Yes sir.
Fine. Now I want you to complete
the analysis and determine the
danger not only to this ship but
the Klingon vessel as well.
Yes Captain... That will take a
couple of hours.
You'll remain at your station
until it is complete, then report
to me. Lieutenant Worf will
supervise you.
Yes sir.
... and then I will instruct you
in Enterprise etiquette.
Commander's log, supplemental,
Stardate 42607.8. I have been
on the Pagh a short time but long
enough to be impressed with the
abilities and singlemindedness
of the Klingons. I can now see
why they have gained the respect
of Captain Picard.
You're not eating very much.
Well, I'm not that hungry.
Is the food all right, Commander?
Fine. The "pipius" was excellent,
and I also liked the "Bregit
lungs."
And the Rokeg blood pie?
Excellent.
Then you'll also like this.
This is "gagh," isn't it?
Very good. You did some research
on our nutritional choices.
Yes... but this is still moving.
"Gagh" is always best when served
live.
Would you like something "easier"?
Easier?
If Klingon food is too strong for
you, perhaps I could get one of
the females to breast feed you.
Don't tell me you're still
concerned about my not
weakening?
Look around. You'll see that
there are no old warriors.
Of course, I'm sure they all died
with honor.
Exactly. You may live long enough
to learn about us.
He's not very attractive, but
I will have him.
They are inquisitive. They would
like to know how you would endure.
Endure what?
Them.
One or both?
It is confirmed that the organisms
feed on some of the compounds that
make up the Enterprise hull.
And the Klingon ship, the Pagh?
They are much more susceptible.
Their hull contains all of the
compounds.
Project your calculations.
According to the rate of
reproduction there should be a
twelve centimeter hole in the
Klingon hull at this time.
Signal them at once and advise
them. Change our course to
attempt an intercept. We will
make every attempt to cleanse the
vessel and assist with repairs.
It will take some time to locate
them. They are on undesignated
maneuvers in the Pheben solar
system.
Then start immediately. Alert
Engineering of this situation.
Ensign Crusher, adjust course
toward the proper sector.
Aye sir. Shall we prepare for
warp speed?
Yes...
... and hope that we get there
in time.
Commander Riker to the bridge.
On monitor. Tell me Commander
Riker, what do you make of this?
I felt no collision. Were we hit
by a small meteor?
There was no collision.
Corrosion then.
No, not corrosion.
Science Station, analyze.
We already have and fortunately
the cavity opened into a section
that could withstand the change
in pressure.
Then what is it?
A space organism eating away at
our hull. Our estimate is that
in less than eight hours we will
have lost too much of our shell
to remain intact.
You must have a way to repair
it.
I'm afraid not.
There has to be. Where did this
come from?
"Where" might be the answer.
The only contact we had was with
the Enterprise.
There was no direct contact with
the Enterprise.
Tactics Officer, report to
Commander Riker.
The Enterprise did conduct an
intensive scan of this vessel.
It's normal procedure.
What type of beam did the
Enterprise use to create this
damage in our hull?
None! Why would they do that?
We are allies.
My logs indicate that the
Enterprise directed an intense
scanning beam at this specific
area for a duration of two
minutes.
Explain that.
I can't.
It could be a weapon.
Wait a minute. Why? There's
no new weapon. The Enterprise
has no reason to do this,
especially not with me on board.
It makes no sense.
"Why" is no longer important.
What is important is our response
to this attack.
Engage cloaking device. Change
course to intercept the
Enterprise.
Captain, what do you intend to
do?
Intend? There is only one
response. We intend to attack
the Enterprise and destroy it!!
You seem to be making progress.
You've already eliminated half
the possibilities.
Thank you, but I seem to have
become efficient a little later
than was needed. It was my
responsibility to learn and adapt
to the Enterprise's regulations.
I didn't do that.
Not really, it was an error.
Captain Picard may not like them,
but he does know they can happen
from time to time.
I failed, I had an opportunity
to show the captain my superior
abilities and I failed. I can
never recover from that.
It was a mistake... That's all.
You didn't put the organism on
the hull. You discovered it and
you were attempting to analyze
it. All you did was mess up a
little on the ship's protocol.
I know you're trying to be nice
to me and I appreciate it. What
I don't understand is why?
Why not? I thought you could use
a friend.
Thank you. I only hope I can
learn your ways before I "mess" up
again. I imagine my methods seem
foolish to you.
They are different. But that's
what this exchange program is all
about... You learn the way we
do things and bring that
information back to your command.
It's up to you to decide which
way is better for you.
It's easy. All you have to do
is learn.
You're right. I'll try your
way...
I'll work even harder than before.
I'll succeed brilliantly.
What is the status?
Unchanged. The rate of increase
continues.
Commander Riker, check the
organism growth with Engineering.
Keep him under scrutiny. I'm
not sure I trust him.
I'm not totally convinced that
Riker knew of any plot against
us. If he did then why would he
have come on board?
Because he was ordered to.
To die?
To be ordered to die is an
expectation for any officer at
any time.
For a Klingon perhaps, but Riker's
people do not volunteer for death
so easily. Even so, Riker may
be a spy, but he's no coward.
That only proves that he is
intelligent and that you may not
be as strong as you used to be.
Captain, we have picked up the
Enterprise.
So soon?
The Enterprise is on an intercept
course with us.
You almost had me believing that
perhaps this was a
misunderstanding.
Yes... So?
The Enterprise has changed course
and is following us. Why?
I don't know. Let's ask them.
The reason is obvious. Their
intent is clear. How long before
we have contact?
Less than fifteen minutes, sir.
Put the ship on battle alert.
Arm all photon torpedoes and put
phasers on full power. Let them
charge into their destruction.
Sir, bearings show that we should
be in contact with the Klingon
ship.
Slow to impulse speed. Continue
on course.
Aye sir, impulse speed.
Hailing frequencies open. There
is no response.
Continue to transmit.
The Pagh is either destroyed or
cloaked.
Begin intensive scan for debris.
Conduct a thorough search of the
area.
The Enterprise has slowed to
impulse speed and is making an
intensive sweep.
Hold your position. Let them come
to us.
They may be here to help you...
Don't be a fool!
Do not forget my rank.
I haven't. I am simply trying
to get you to understand.
I fully understand... Now you
understand.
I am still the captain of this
vessel and you are still crew and
sworn to obey me. You gave me
your oath.
Yes sir, I did.
Then fulfill that oath and serve
this ship as you swore to.
Tell me of the surest method of
attack against the Enterprise.
I can't.
You must tell me. It is a matter
of honor and loyalty.
I cannot surrender the secrets
of Starfleet and the Enterprise
to you.
Then if your word is no good, how
can we trust any of your people?
I won't break any vow I took in
the past. I also swore a loyalty
to your ship and I will keep that.
They are in conflict!
No sir, they are not! I will obey
your orders. I will serve this
ship as first officer, and in an
attack against the Enterprise I
will die along with this crew...
but I will not dishonor my oath
to the Enterprise.
If you had agreed to disclose
those facts about the Enterprise
I would have labelled you a
traitor and killed you on the
spot...
Instead you will die with us.
You will die like a Klingon.
So be it.
Sir, I have something to report
to you immediately.
Go ahead, Ensign.
I have managed to isolate the
organism on our hull.
Spare me the technical details...
just the results.
They are of a sub-micron form.
They are controllable and can
be removed from the hulls of both
ships.
Thank you Ensign, well done.
Prepare whatever procedures are
necessary.
Lieutenant Worf, add this
information to hailing messages.
Aye sir. Still no response.
The Enterprise has changed hailing
messages. They now include a
promise of cleaning the organisms
and assisting in repairs.
They mean it... They will help.
And I mean what I say.
Arm all weapons... Prepare for
attack...
Captain's log, supplemental,
Stardate 42608.2. Although our
search has been extensive, we are
still unable to locate the
Klingon ship or any debris. The
absence of both leaves us puzzled
and somewhat tentative.
Considering the absence of debris,
it is reasonable to assume the
Klingon vessel is in the vicinity
and cloaked.
Agreed.
Since we do not know their intent
I recommend we go to Red Alert.
Make it so.
The Enterprise has raised its
shields.
It is normal procedure when
entering into a suspicious
situation. The act is not
aggressive. The Enterprise will
not fire first.
Then they are fools, for we will.
You'll get only one shot.
We will only need one. Arm all
phasers and torpedoes. Prepare
to fire them simultaneously.
Then I recommend you do not fire
until you are within forty
thousand kilometers.
Why?
It will reduce their response
time.
You are honoring your promise to
serve us.
Would you do less?
No.
You will give the order to fire,
Commander Riker.
Call out distances.
Any questions, Mister Riker?
Just something I have to say...
... I dispute your judgment. Your
reasons for forcing this
confrontation are not valid.
Are you finished?
Yes sir.
Then commence with attack as
ordered.
Fifty-five thousand kilometers
and closing.
Is that a weapon?
No sir, it is a signaling device.
Hand it to me, Commander.
We are getting an emergency signal
from a command transponder.
Location nine-three-five mark
six-one-three... Frequency
and code designate it as Commander
Riker.
Chief O'Brien, align with
emergency transponder signal.
Yes Captain. We are not yet in
safe range for a transfer and
defensive shields are still in
place.
We may have to stretch it a
little. On my command.
Forty-eight thousand.
Lieutenant Worf to the Transporter
Room. Doctor Pulaski will
accompany you. Mendon take over
the count.
Yes sir. Forty-five thousand and
still closing.
Forty-four thousand.
Transporter Room, ready. You will
control defensive shields...
Ready sir.
Forty thousand...
Forty thousand.
Prepare to drop cloaking shields
and fire. Steady...
Transporter Room, energize.
Hold where you are Klag. I have
relieved Captain Kargan. He was
acting in an irrational manner.
I am now your captain!!
Serve this ship as I have!
Defensive shields back in place.
Who are you?
I am Lieutenant Worf of the
Starship Enterprise.
Riker has no honor... He tricked
me!!
He's barely stunned.
Of course, he is a Klingon
captain.
That's great, but where's Will
Riker?
Cloaking shields off.
Obey my orders.
We will be destroyed.
If we are, it will be in battle
and I will die with you.
Now, cloaking shields off!
It is the Pagh sir. It has all
armament locked on us and ready
to fire.
Hold position. Hailing
frequencies open.
Calling the Pagh. This is the
Enterprise. We are here to assist
you. Do not fire.
They will not believe you.
Pagh... Do you read me??
Enterprise, this is Captain
William Riker of the Klingon
vessel, the Pagh.
I order you to lower your shields
and surrender.
Lower shields.
Surrender as ordered.
I demand to be beamed back aboard
my vessel.
Transporter Chief, prepare to beam
Captain Kargan aboard the Pagh.
Captain Riker, preparations are
ready for immediate repairs to
your ship.
Thank you, Captain Picard.
You should have killed me.
I don't want your command.
You tricked me so you could have
it.
And I give it back to you now.
Then return to your position.
No more, Captain Kargan...
Get him off my ship!
Yes, Captain.
You understand the Klingons better
than I thought.
Thank you, my friend.
That might be one of the shortest
assignments in the history of
Starfleet.
You're wrong, Number One... it
was almost the longest.
You did well.
Thank you. I learned quite a bit.
Apparently not how to duck.
When not to duck would be more
accurate.
If that was the intention...
Welcome aboard.
Thank you. Your little toy
worked.
I'm glad it did, sir.
You come from a very brave and
unique race. I'm glad you're here
on the Enterprise.
Thank you, Commander...
... and welcome home.
