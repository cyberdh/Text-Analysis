Open hailing frequencies.
Hailing frequencies opened.
Repulse, this is the Enterprise.
We are getting underway.
Acknowledged, Enterprise.
Transfer complete -- good luck on
your mission.
And to you.
Give my regards to your captain.
Repulse out.
The Shuttle Bay is secure.
Thank you Mister Crusher. Make
all preparations to get underway.
We will construct this large
enclosure on Cargo Deck Five.
Come.
The transfer is complete. Doctor
Pulaski is being shown to her
quarters. We are ready to get
underway.
Very good. Take a look at the
containment module our new chief
engineer has designed.
"Chief engineer," that has a nice
ring to it.
It does to me.
Each will have total atmospheric
control... temperature, radiation,
light, humidity, plus electrical
spectrums.
And these are put into the large
containment area?
Yes, these modules will keep the
specimens alive -- the large
containment area will keep us
alive. Now, I have to go and
replicate this five hundred and
twelve times. This will mean
it will be necessary to divert
power from the warp engines to
the replicator.
How long will we be on impulse
power?
For a few hours, but it can't be
helped.
When we leave 'aucdet Nine - I'm
going to want all the power you
can slam into those warp engines.
You'll have it.
I will relieve you at zero three
zero zero.
Take us out of orbit, Mister
Crusher -- set course for 'aucdet
Nine.
Aye, sir. Course for 'aucdet Nine
has been input.
Maximum impulse velocity.
Aye, sir.
Engage.
Engineering -- this is Science One.
I just observed what appeared to
be a random energy transference.
Where?
Aft. Outboard of the port
nacelle.
Hold on -- I'll check.
No -- I show nothing here, Data.
Problem, Commander?
Possibly. An unexplained power
fluctuation.
Let me know if it reoccurs.
Captain's log, Stardate 42073.1.
There has been an outbreak of a
yet unclassified Plasma Plague
in the densely populated Rachelis
system. We are on an emergency
run to a Federation Research
station on 'aucdet Nine, where
specimens of Plasma Plague are
kept. We will then transport that
deadly cargo to Science Station
Tango Sierra, where hopefully an
antidote can be manufactured.
Every hour we delay, thousands
die.
How's it going?
Finished, just waiting to insert
the modules.
Number One.
Lieutenant LaForge says we will
be able to engage the warp drive
within the hour.
Mister Data, when we receive a
complete list of all the specimens
we will be carrying, I want you
and Doctor Pulaski to go through
it... by the way. Where is our
new doctor? Has she reported in?
Not yet.
Sickbay, this is the captain.
Sickbay, aye.
Is Doctor Pulaski there?
Ah... no, Sir. The doctor is in
Ten-Forward.
What?!
A few hours on board and she's
already found Ten-Forward.
I'll go and get her.
No, Number One. I'll go.
Not the best way to meet your new
captain.
Hello, Captain.
Ensign Crusher.
I'm sorry this mission will delay
your reunion with your mother.
It's all right. I can use the
time to finish some projects.
We shouldn't be more than a week
or so.
It is going to be hard to leave
the Enterprise...
Mixed feelings for all of us.
It's always difficult leaving any
ship, as it was for your mother
when she left to become head of
Starfleet Medical. But going
from one assignment to another
is part of the life which you are
choosing.
Yes, but this isn't "any" ship.
Truly.
Guinan.
Captain.
Where's Doctor Pulaski?
Doctor Katherine Pulaski?
Ah... you must be Captain
Picard...
Doctor -- protocol on your last
assignment might have been lax,
but here on the Enterprise...
Sit down, Captain. You better
listen to this.
Lieutenant LaForge, status
report.
The containment area is completed,
the last of the modules are being
inserted.
Take us to warp six as soon as
possible.
Acknowledged.
This is Doctor Katherine Pulaski.
We will handle the formal
introduction later.
Counselor Deanna Troi is
pregnant.
A baby!
This is a surprise.
More so for me.
This pregnancy is unlike anything
I have ever encountered. Since
she came to me a few hours ago,
I have made two complete
examinations of Counselor Troi.
This is from the first
examination. The fetus is about
halfway through the first
trimester -- about six weeks old.
Understand, we...
... believe conception occurred
about eleven hours ago.
What?
It gets better.
The second exam, an hour later
was consistent, except for the
fact that the fetus "appeared"
to be several weeks older.
At this growth rate, Counselor
Troi will have her baby within
the next thirty-six hours. The
normal gestation for a Betazoid
is ten months.
I do not mean to be indelicate,
but...
... who's the father?
Last night, while I slept...
something... which I can only
describe it as a presence, entered
my body.
A life-form of unknown origin
and intent is breeding right now
inside Counselor Troi. Our
purpose here is to determine what
is to be done about this very
"unusual" situation. Discussion.
Let me get this straight -- Deanna
was impregnated by... by what?
Doctor, what do your tests show?
Is it a humanoid? An alien?
It's a male human... or in this
case half-human -- half-Betazoid.
Exactly the same as Deanna!
In every way. There is no
indication from any of my tests
of any other genetic patterns
except hers.
I don't think this is a random
occurrence. There is a purpose
here -- a reason. What, I don't
know.
Captain, obviously the pregnancy
must be terminated.
Why?
For the safety of the ship and
crew.
Worf, you can't assume its intent
is belligerent.
That is my safest assumption.
Captain, this is a life-form.
Not to allow it to develop
naturally would deny us the
opportunity to study it.
If the fetus is aborted,
laboratory analysis is still
possible.
Is there any health risk to
Counselor Troi if the fetus is
aborted?
Medically, no.
Doctor, is that your
recommendation?
Captain, do whatever you feel is
necessary to protect the ship and
the crew... but know this. I am
going to have this baby.
I believe that ends the
discussion.
Captain's log, supplemental. We
have finally arrived at 'aucdet
Nine. We will pick up the
specimens of Plasma Plague and
transport them to Rachelis.
It is only because so many lives
are at stake that I am willing
to put this ship and crew at such
great risk.
How are you feeling?
I should be feeling uncomfortable
with all the changes in my
body... but, I'm not. I feel
fine -- better than fine.
Wonderful.
Standard orbit.
Standard orbit, aye.
Open hailing frequencies.
Hailing frequencies open.
'Aucdet Nine, this is Captain
Jean-Luc Picard of the USS
Enterprise.
Ah... yes... Enterprise you're
here at last. Good.
Excuse me, to whom am I speaking?
Oh... I'm Lieutenant Commander
Hester Dealt. The medical trustee
of the Federation Medical
Collection Station.
Are the specimens ready for
transfer?
Yes, but with your permission I
would like to inspect the
containment area before we
proceed. It is not that I doubt
the ability of your crew; we just
cannot afford a mistake.
I appreciate your caution -- in
the same vein, I need a complete,
detailed manifest of everything
which you intend to bring on board
my ship.
I will allow access to the
computer banks.
Download the inventory and go
through it with Doctor Pulaski.
Number One, arrange to have Hester
Dealt transported up.
Captain, I'm suddenly feeling a
little tired. I'll be in my
quarters if you need me.
It won't be long now. Soon
you'll arrive and so many
questions will be answered.
This is very good. Exactly what's
needed.
I just followed your instructions.
Good. Exactly what I wanted.
Five hundred and twelve
compartments. Individually
controlled. Very good.
Independent of one another.
Perfect. Ah, they can be
monitored from here. And,
isolation is assured. Very, very
good.
I wanted to be sure they wouldn't
get out.
Good, Lieutenant. Very good
indeed.
How's it coming, Mister LaForge?
It will be just a little while
longer. I want to go over it
again in more detail.
It will be another couple of
hours, Commander.
You do understand, it's critical
that we have zero growth.
Oh, yes. I understand. So, you
go over it as many times as you
want.
It's been fourteen hours since
we arrived at 'aucdet Nine.
Hester Dealt is making final
selections of the specimens we
will carry. Meanwhile, we
continue to receive desperate
pleas from the Rachelis System.
Captain, the final manifest has
been received.
At last. Review it with Doctor
Pulaski. I want both of you to
be completely familiar with it.
Aye sir.
Data -- help me get to Sickbay.
It's time.
Oh, you bet it is. Let's get you
into Sickbay.
Worf -- assemble your security team
in Sickbay.
Is that necessary?
Yes -- captain's orders.
Strange to need armed guards in
the delivery room.
Yes, and strange to think my child
is the cause.
Before you referred to it as "the
child," now it's become your
child.
Yes, whatever his beginnings,
that's what he's become.
How frequent are your
contractions?
Very close together.
In all my other deliveries -- with
a couple of exceptions -- the
father was present.
Difficult under the circumstances.
It's unfortunate you have to go
through this alone. It helps to
have someone with you.
Perhaps I could serve in that
capacity. I can quickly review
the procedures I will be required
to execute.
Troi is going to need the comfort
of a "human" touch... Not the cold
hand of technology.
Doctor. I think Commander Data
will do nicely.
Your choice.
There is nothing specific you have
to do, Data, you just have to be
with me.
There is nothing to be nervous
about.
This is very interesting to me.
Although I understand in technical
terms how life is formed, there
is still a part of the process
which eludes my understanding.
I began my existence as an adult.
I have no memory -- no cognizance
of conception, birth, childhood,
so to be allowed to witness this
event is...
It's happening.
Doctor!
This is an impatient baby. He's
eager to make his appearance.
I'll give you something for the
pain. It won't in any way
diminish the experience.
I have felt no pain.
None?
No... none at all.
Have your security team stand over
there. I understand the need to
have you here, but keep out from
under foot.
Are easy births the norm for
Betazoids?
Not according to my mother.
It's a boy. A normal, healthy,
six pound, three ounce baby boy.
You can come the rest of the way
in now.
No threat here, Lieutenant, you
and your men can relax... it's
just a baby.
It was remarkable. Thank you for
allowing me to participate.
Do you have a name?
Ian Andrew, after my father.
Captain.
Picard here.
Counselor Troi is the mother of
a very healthy baby boy. Mother
and child are both doing well.
Counselor, my best wishes to you
and your son.
Thank you, sir.
Have you been here all along?
Yes.
He's beautiful, Deanna... just
like his mother.
I don't think you are going to
be needed here, Lieutenant.
How do you feel?
Fine. Absolutely wonderful and
thank you, Doctor... for
everything.
Amazing.
Welcome to the bridge, Doctor.
How's Counselor Troi? Did she
have a good night?
I have delivered dozens of babies.
But none like this. There was
no pain, no trauma. It was
effortless for both of them.
I'm not sure of your point.
She had the baby yesterday. If
I were to examine her now, I would
not be able to tell that she just
had a baby, or ever had a baby.
It's as though the incident never
happened.
How long before we are ready to
begin the transfer?
Two hours, nineteen minutes.
You have the Conn, Number One.
Aye, sir.
Doctor, you would accompany me,
please. I think it's time I paid
my respects.
Come in.
I wanted to come by and see how
you were and have a look at
your...
... baby! My goodness.
How old is he?
In actuality a day.
Yes, but...
... In appearance, almost four
earth years old.
Ian, say hello to Captain Picard.
You mean he can talk?
Hello.
Hello, Ian.
Don't worry. Everything is fine.
Captain's log, supplemental. We
are faced with two major problems:
Troi's child and the deadly cargo
we are about to load, which is
so desperately needed in the
Rachelis system. In the hours
since his birth, Troi's baby has
continued to age and now appears,
physically and mentally, to be
a child of eight. And still there
is no indication as to who he is,
or why he is here.
Sickbay, this is the bridge. We
are ready to begin loading.
We need a little more time. It's
taking longer than we anticipated.
Data,
look at this.
Data.
What?
My name. It is pronounced Data.
Oh?
You called me Data.
What's the difference?
One is my name and the other is
not.
Is this possible?
In all of your neural nets,
algorithms, and heuristics, is
there some combination which makes
up a circuit for bruised feelings?
Apparently so, because I think
I just offended your tender
sensibilities.
Possible?
I am unfamiliar with these
symbols.
It indicates a genetically
engineered biological life-form.
About twenty percent of the
specimens fall into that category.
Some eager beaver at play.
Query... "eager beaver?"
In this case, 'eager beaver'
refers to some overachieving
genetic engineer, who probably
for lack of something better to
do forced this strain of virus
to mutate, just to see how bad,
bad can get.
Captain Picard.
Picard here.
Just so you fully appreciate the
risks we are about to take...
Enlighten me.
If the most innocuous specimen
on the manifest list gets loose,
it will destroy all life on the
Enterprise in a matter of hours.
I understand, Doctor. Do you have
a recommendation?
Considering how desperately this
is needed, no I don't. Just want
you to know what we're carrying.
Thank you, Doctor. Commander
Data, if you have completed your
review, you are needed in
Transporter Room Three.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, Doctor.
That's okay...
Data, Data... whatever.
Ian!
He's a very tactile child. He
wants to touch and feel
everything.
Come on, sweetheart, time to go.
Unbelievable -- I think he's
actually grown since you dropped
him off.
I like it here, Mommy.
I thought you would. Thank Miss
Gladstone for having you, and
let's go get you something to eat.
Thank you.
Bye...
Thank you.
The transporter is not making a
positive lock.
The built-in inhibitor is
restricting onloading of
life-forms known to be hazardous
to the occupants of this ship.
Have you attempted override?
I don't have the authority.
Computer, recognize -- Lieutenant
Commander N-F-N, N-M-I, Data.
Authorization accepted.
Initiate override protocol.
Override protocol is not
recommended in this situation.
Acknowledged. On my authority
-- begin override.
Sequence complete.
Cargo Deck Five. We will commence
transport on your command.
Transporter Three -- we are ready
to receive.
Data, the first batch is in place.
Ready for the next.
Inform me when loading is complete
and the cargo secure.
Aye, sir.
I wanted to stop by and see how
Ian was doing.
We're doing fine. I was just
going to give Ian his supper.
Do you want your supper now, too?
No, Ian, but thank you for the
invitation.
You're welcome.
Have you ever played with puppies?
They had a litter today in the
nursery.
No, I have never played with
puppies.
You'd like it. You should go
to the nursery while the puppies
are still there.
Perhaps later.
Ouch...
Ow... Mommy... ow...
Let me look at that.
It's not serious.
My face is wet.
Is it better now, sweetheart?
He allowed himself to be burned.
Yes, for the experience.
Who is he? Why is he here? What
does he want?
Ian, could you tell us why you
are here?
Because Mommy said it was time
to eat.
No, I mean... why you are here
on this ship?
I live here.
Ian, the captain wants to know
if you are ready to tell us why
you came here.
No. Not yet.
The answer is within him. When
his cognitive powers develop
sufficiently, he will be able to
articulate it.
I hope he will tell us soon.
Captain to the bridge.
I'm on my way, Number One.
Keep me apprised of his progress,
Counselor.
Bye...
The cargo has been loaded and is
secure.
Take us out of orbit, Number One
-- then set a course for Rachelis
-- warp nine.
Can I get you something?
No. I just wanted to stand here.
I don't blame you -- it's
beautiful.
Yes.
How about some nice Mareuvian Tea?
No. Nothing thank you.
You're going to be leaving soon.
Yes.
What do you see when you look out
there?
Over there is the Lorenze cluster,
and there Arneb and there Epsilon
Indi.
No, I don't mean that. I mean
when you look there don't you see
your future?
It will still be there.
How about a cup of nectar direct
from Prometheus?
No -- nothing. That's the third
time you've asked me.
It's what I'm expected to do.
Don't you always do what's
expected?
I try to.
Even if it's not what you really
want?
Sometimes. Sometimes you have
to consider others more than
yourself.
That's true. But sometimes the
game is to know when to consider
yourself more than others and to
give yourself permission to be...
selfish.
Something's wrong.
What is it?
Growth.
Where?
L-seven-three.
Bridge, this is Cargo Deck Five.
Yes, Lieutenant LaForge.
There is a malfunction in the
containment area.
How serious?
Very.
Captain's log, supplemental. For
reasons as yet unknown, one of
the specimens of Plasma Plague
is growing.
Captain, the power to the
containment grid must have somehow
been affected when we increased
to warp velocity.
I don't see how that would be
possible.
I don't either, but if we could
return to impulse, we would know
for sure.
Impulse velocity.
Report, Mister LaForge.
There's no change. It wasn't the
warp drive.
Permission to leave the bridge.
Granted.
Commander Data, you're with me.
Doctor Pulaski.
Yes, Captain.
We are having some difficulties
on Cargo Deck Five -- your presence
is requested.
I'm on my way.
You never talk about yourself.
Sure I do... all the time.
People say you are very old...
Oh?
... and that you knew Captain
Picard when he was on the
Stargazer.
No. I never met the captain until
I came onboard.
Everyone is very curious about
you.
I'll bet they are.
About where you come from.
Where do they say?
I heard that you're from Nova Kron
and that...
Mister Crusher, report to the
bridge.
I've got to go.
Thank you.
There's nothing like a dish of
Delovian souffle.
I didn't mean the souffle, I meant
for... well... the rest. Thanks.
That's why I'm here.
Take the Conn, Mister Crusher.
On this course -- increase velocity
to warp nine.
Aye, sir. Warp nine.
Why that module and not the
others?
Computer, run diagnostic on module
L-seven-three.
All circuits functional.
Temperature -- as set -- minus
ninety-seven degrees. Humidity
-- twelve percent. Lumins -- zero.
Electromagnetic containment
integrity... Everything right down
the line... exactly as it should
be.
Perhaps it is a sensor malfunction.
Computer -- query. Is growth
actually occurring?
Confirmed.
One of the specimens is growing.
Destroy it, now.
I can't.
Data, prepare to jettison that
module.
We can't do that either. It will
go into a spore and remain until
it comes in contact with a planet
or another ship. The results
would be disastrous.
Commander, your attitude tells
me that however bad I think this
is... it's worse.
This is not going to hold it.
Go on.
The rate of growth is increasing.
Within thirty minutes it will push
out of the module. Within two
hours, it will breach the
containment area.
It can't break through this.
Yes it can.
Captain. We may not be able to
get control of this situation.
I recommend making arrangements
to transfer all non-essential
personnel to the saucer section.
If we lose containment we should
be prepared to separate.
Make it so.
Why this one specimen and none
of the others? Something is
stimulating it. Do you have its
etiology? How it was developed?
It's a mutated strain developed
by Doctor Susan Nuress during an
outbreak of Plasma Plague seventy
years ago in the Oby System.
It was number nine in a series
of tests. This particular one
bombarded by low levels of Eichner
radiation.
Could exposure to Eichner
radiation stimulate growth?
Yes, it could, but...
Uh, oh...
Don't tell me.
I'm detecting low levels of
Eichner radiation.
Why didn't you catch it before?
Because it wasn't here before..
Well, it is now. What emits that
type radiation?
A subspace phase inverter.
We don't have one.
Certain cyanoacrylates.
Also, not on this ship... What
else? Because it's here and we
better find it.
I can feel that some of the people
are very... worried.
Yes. I feel it as well, but don't
you worry.
It's me Mommy -- I'm the reason.
What?
It's me.
You?
Yes. I have to leave you now,
or it will be very bad for
everyone.
What are you saying?
I have to leave now.
Leave?
You are going to die. No. No,
you can't.
Sickbay, this is Counselor Troi,
I need the doctor in my
quarters... right now.
No... Ian... No.
It's Ian. Please... please hurry.
Save him, you must save him.
What happened? Did he eat
anything? Did he fall?
No.
The child is the source of the
unusual radiation.
He said he's the reason the ship
is in danger.
That analysis is correct.
I'm losing life signs.
Oh, please. Please save him.
I'm sorry.
Captain. The containment field
has stabilized.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Then Ian was right. He was the
cause.
Apparently so.
He is a life-force entity... as
we passed each other in space he
was curious and wanted to know
about us, and he thought the best
way to learn was to go through
the process. To be born, to live
as one of us and in that way to
understand us.
Captain, he never meant any harm.
There was a moment when you
smiled.
He said thank you.
I told him we will miss him -- and
I will.
Standard station approach, Mister
Crusher.
Standard approach, aye.
Transporter Room Three, this is
the captain. We have arrived.
Let's make this transfer with all
deliberate speed, and get on about
our business.
Yes, sir.
I will be glad to be relieved of
this cargo.
You have the bridge, Number One.
Yes sir.
Captain.
Yes Ensign?
Could I see you when you have a
moment?
In my Ready Room when your duties
permit.
Thank you, sir.
Good luck.
Data, you can lock on to the first
group and begin transporting on
my mark.
Come.
Yes, Ensign.
Captain... I have thought about
this a lot. I want to remain on
the Enterprise.
Oh. Have you discussed this with
your mother?
No, before I do that, I wanted
your permission to stay.
Wes, it's a little more
complicated than that.
Captain, for right now... this
is where I want to be. This is
where I feel I belong.
Captain -- transfer complete. We
are ready to leave orbit.
Make it so, Number One.
Return to your position.
All stations secure.
Take us out of orbit, Mister
Crusher and lay in a course for
the Morgana Quadrant.
Yes, sir.
Mister Crusher has requested to
remain on the Enterprise.
I'm not surprised. How did you
respond?
I haven't as yet, Number One.
I don't think it's my decision
alone. His remaining will cause
difficulties for us all.
Yes, indeed. With his mother not
around, who will see to his
studies?
Exactly. That duty would fall
to Commander Data.
And, who'll tuck him in at night?
Come on, Commander.
I will accept that responsibility.
Well, we know he'll get his sleep.
Then, Number One, that leaves you
the task of guiding young Mister
Crusher through his most hazardous
journey -- from youth to man. Are
you willing to serve?
Difficult question...
... Yes, I think I can do that.
All right then. Mister Crusher,
communicate with your mother at
Starfleet Medical headquarters.
Give her my regards and tell her
you have my permission to remain
on board the Enterprise.
But, that I will abide by her
wishes.
Yes, sir... thank you sir... I
just know she'll agree.
Now -- if you have course and speed
laid in.
Yes sir, they are.
Then, Mister Crusher -- engage.
