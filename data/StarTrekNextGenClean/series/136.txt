			Captain, we are approaching
			Klavdia Three.
			Take us to impulse power.
			Aye, sir. Impulse power.
			Bridge, this is Engineering.
			Yes, Lieutenant.
			Now that we are out of warp, I
			would like to use this time to
			make routine adjustments to the
			deuterium control conduit. It's
			overdue.
			That would preclude use of our
			warp drive engines.
			How much time do these adjustments
			require?
			A few hours, sir.
			You may proceed, Lieutenant La
			Forge. Standard orbit.
			Aye, sir. Standard orbit.
			I am going to need an S-C-M, model
			three, from stores.
			Right away.
			Magnify.
			Not a very inviting planet. Even
			for a research outpost.
			I would have thought the
			inhabitants of Daled Four would
			send a future leader to a more
			hospitable environment.
			For some, security is more
			important than comfort.
			But sixteen years...
			We are being hailed, Captain.
			Open hailing frequencies, Mister
			Worf.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			This is Captain Picard of the USS
			Enterprise.
			The planet's troposphere is
			distorting the signal.
			Can you clean it up?
			I'll try.
			This is Picard -- would you please
			repeat your message?
			I am Anya. Have you come for
			Salia of Daled Four?
			That is correct.
			What species are you?
			Human.
			Excellent. Bring us aboard. That
			is all.
			Friendly, isn't she?
			Whether they're friendly or not,
			Salia has the rank of head of
			state. We will treat both her
			and Anya accordingly. Number
			One, Mister Worf, let's greet our
			visitors.
			Welcome aboard the Enterprise.
			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
			This is Salia of Daled Four.
			I didn't feel a thing. Is that
			normal when you are transported,
			Captain?
			It is.
			Those must be the matter/energy
			conversion controls. May I take
			a look?
			Of course.
			If you like, I'll arrange a tour
			of the ship.
			I'd love that.
			No.
			That won't be necessary. Just
			show us our quarters, Captain
			Picard.
			Very well.
			We are housing you in the quarters
			normally reserved for Starfleet
			admiralty. I'm sure you'll find
			them quite comfortable.
			That's a superconducting magnet,
			isn't it?
			Yes... It's a... say, how did you
			know that?
			Study, for the last sixteen years
			it is all I could...
			Please walk ahead with me.
			You'd better be careful. I was
			taught those can rip the iron
			right out of your blood cells.
			Who are you? No one mentioned
			we were beaming up such a... a...
			Please, Salia.
			I don't believe this! Who is she?
			I think she's a governess.
			Not her. The girl.
			I doubt she'll have time for you,
			my friend. She's slated to rule
			an entire world.
			Come in.
			You wanted to see me.
			Data -- the girl who just came on
			board.
			Salia of Daled Four.
			There's almost nothing in the
			computer about her.
			Very little is known.
			What can you tell me?
			She was born on Daled Four. Her
			parents were from opposite sides
			of factions which have been
			feuding for centuries. They died
			shortly after her birth. A
			Federation ship brought her and
			her governess to Klavdia Three
			to be raised in a neutral
			environment.
			And now she's returning.
			It is hoped she will unite the
			factions and bring peace.
			Wesley, are you all right?
			Geordi.
			Oh... Yes.. I'm fine... I just...
			We are waiting for the part.
			I'm on my way.
			Got to go. Thanks, Data.
			Captain, we've laid in a course
			for Daled Four. We will remain
			on impulse power until Lieutenant
			LaForge completes his
			adjustments.
			Status report on our passengers,
			Lieutenant Worf. Did the
			accommodations meet with their
			approval?
			I doubt anything ever meets with
			that woman's approval, sir.
			Captain, I'm concerned.
			About... ?
			Our new passengers. Their
			emotions do not seem to fit...
			... well, who they are and what
			they're doing.
			Are you suggesting they're not
			who they say they are?
			Actually... no. It's more like
			they're not exactly what they seem
			to be. At least, not exactly.
			Captain Picard to Salia's
			quarters. May I turn on the
			viewer?
			Yes, of course.
			Are your quarters satisfactory?
			Yes. Very.
			Thank you for checking on us,
			Captain. I only hope my quarters
			on Daled Four will be this
			luxurious.
			Feel free to contact me if you
			need anything. Picard out.
			What I sensed in that seems
			entirely normal. Emotionally,
			I judge her to be very drawn to
			our young ensign.
			What puzzles me, Captain, is how
			she is expected to bring peace
			to Daled Four. The one thing
			we do know about it is that its
			inhabitants have been fighting
			throughout their recorded history.
			What do we know about the cause
			of their wars?
			Only that it is the difference
			between night and day.
			Data, you just used a
			colloquialism.
			I did? I meant that Daled Four
			does not rotate. One side has
			constant night, the other constant
			daylight. One might surmise that
			the two hemispheres developed
			disparate cultures, which is a
			major cause of most wars.
			And yet somehow this child is
			supposed to bring them together.
			She looks too delicate for a task
			like that.
			Do not be fooled by her looks.
			The body is just a shell.
			How can I be a leader if I don't
			know anything about my people?
			You will lead because you are
			accepted by both sides. And
			because it is in your blood.
			What am I expected to do when I
			get there?
			You will know.
			How?
			You just will. Salia, you must
			arrive with an open mind, without
			preconceived ideas about the world
			you will find or the people on
			either side.
			It's very frustrating.
			Yes -- I know. You feel the weight
			of so much responsibility. And
			you're not sure you can live up
			to everyone's expectations.
			It's not only that. Nobody's
			asked me if this is something I
			want.
			It is your duty.
			I have no choice.
			None. It won't be as bad as you
			think. In fact it could be quite
			wonderful. Besides... you are
			the last and only chance.
			Don't you think I'm going to need
			more than instinct to do whatever
			is expected of me on Daled Four?
			Energy depletion level.
			Point oh-four percent and
			increasing.
			Wesley?
			Wesley! Haven't you found the
			defocused area yet?
			I'm looking!
			I see the way you're looking.
			Sorry.
			I've got my mind on something.
			Geordi, this girl they beamed up,
			she's... she's perfect! Perfect!
			Now I understand why you can't
			concentrate.
			I'll do better.
			Warning -- resonant field applied!
			Warning!
			What is it?
			I had it on the wrong setting.
			I suppose it had to happen to you.
			It usually does at about this age.
			What usually does?
			Glands suddenly meshing together.
			It happens to all of us.
			You've got to be joking. Just
			because I said she's
			interesting...
			You said she's "perfect."
			Go. You're no use here for now.
			Go talk to her. Take the lift.
			That's silly, Geordi.
			Well, since you recommend it...
			If she'll talk to me, how should
			I approach her? What would I say?
			Just say "Hi. I'm Wesley Crusher.
			I'd like to talk to you."
			And then what?
			Whatever occurs to you.
			What if nothing occurs to me?
			Wesley, I don't really have time
			for this. You're going to have
			to ask somebody else.
			Okay.
			That is how the Klingon lures a
			mate.
			Are you telling me to go yell at
			Salia?
			No. Men do not roar. Women roar.
			Then they hurl heavy objects.
			And claw at you.
			What does the man do?
			He reads love poetry. He ducks
			a lot.
			Yes, well, that might work for
			Klingons, but I think I should
			try something less dangerous.
			Then go to her door. Beg like
			a human.
			It should be that simple, Wesley.
			Judging by her appearance it is
			likely you and Salia are
			biologically compatible. Of
			course, there may be a difference
			in the histocompatibility complex
			in the cell membrane.
			Data! I want to meet her, not
			dissect her.
			Captain Picard to Salia's
			quarters.
			Yes, Captain?
			May I activate the viewer?
			Certainly.
			I've arranged for Anya to have
			a tour of the ship. Maybe you'd
			like to go along.
			Very much.
			Your escort will be there shortly.
			Picard out.
			I think I'll go on the tour.
			Why can't I?
			This is ridiculous! This will
			be the only chance I ever have
			to see a vessel like this.
			No -- you must remain here where
			it is safe.
			Salia, do an old woman a favor,
			and obey me for the rest of this
			trip.
			You're no more an old woman than
			I am a leader.
			Yes. Come in.
			I am here to escort you on a tour
			of the Enterprise.
			I will be right there.
			You are a leader. And I am older
			than you could ever imagine.
			But what do I say? How should
			I act? What do I do?
			Guinan, I need your help. Could
			you sit over there?
			That seems simple enough.
			The first words out of your mouth
			are the most important. You could
			start by saying something like...
			... "you're the most beautiful
			woman in the galaxy."
			But that might not work.
			Yes it would.
			If you only knew how much I wanted
			to tell you that.
			But you were afraid.
			Yes.
			Of me?
			Of us. Of what we could become...
			Commander Riker...
			... and that you might have
			thought it was a line.
			Maybe I do think it's a line.
			Then you think I'm not sincere?
			I didn't say that. There's
			nothing wrong with a line. It's
			like a knock on the door.
			Then you're inviting me in?
			I'm not sending you away.
			That's more than I expected.
			But is it more than you hoped?
			To hope is to recognize the
			possibility. I had only dreams.
			Dreams can be dangerous.
			Not these dreams.
			I dream of a galaxy where your
			eyes are stars... And all the
			universe worships night.
			Careful, if you place me too high
			on a pedestal, you won't be able
			to reach me.
			Then I'll learn to fly. You are
			the heart in my day and the soul
			of my night.
			I don't think this is my style.
			Shut up, kid.
			Now tell me more about my eyes.
			What is that? What are you doing?
			This is the Deuterium Control
			Conduit. I'm probing it to find
			a defocused area.
			Is there a problem with the ship?
			There's nothing to be concerned
			about. I'm just making routine
			adjustments.
			I understand.
			Ensign Crusher, what are you doing
			here?
			Nothing.
			Is there a problem?
			Can you show me how to work the
			food dispenser?
			Sure.
			No, I meant him.
			Actually all you have to do is
			tell the computer what you want
			and it will prepare it for you.
			Oh... what should I order?
			I don't know. what do you like?
			I'd like something sweet.
			I know... Computer, Thalian
			chocolate mousse.
			It's a wonderful sensation.
			On Thalos Seven they age the cocoa
			beans four hundred years.
			You've been there?
			It's one of my favorite places.
			It must have been fun to visit
			a planet like that!
			It's the best part of being on
			the Enterprise.
			I have learned about some of them,
			but to see them -- that would be
			wonderful.
			Tell me about some of the other
			places you've been.
			There's too many!
			The only world I've known is
			Klavdia Three.
			It's time we changed that.
			How?
			Come with me.
			I'll be with you in a moment.
			What's wrong with him?
			Andronesian Encephalitis. He
			contracted it when our transporter
			filter was disrupted by a cosmic
			ray burst.
			That disease is contagious.
			Yes it is.
			Then we could all be infected.
			Very unlikely. The air filtering
			system can handle --
			But there is a chance.
			If you mean mathematically... Yes,
			the probability is not zero.
			I cannot rely on your primitive
			technologies. Kill the patient!
			What?
			Destroy the patient immediately!
			Calm down -- really there's no
			risk.
			If you won't take action, then
			I will!
			Security to Sickbay! Hurry!
			Hold your fire.
			Anya!
			What is she? Keep her away!
			Do not interfere!
			She wants to kill Hennesey!
			His disease threatens Salia!
			Captain, there is no chance of
			contagion.
			The situation is under control.
			That's not good enough!
			It will have to be.
			Your powers are infinitesimal
			compared to mine!
			Nevertheless, you will obey my
			orders. You are to remain in your
			quarters and in your present form
			for the remainder of this voyage.
			Is that clear?
			Very.
			Keep her under guard.
			What kind of creature is she?
			I've never seen anything like her.
			There are no such life-forms in
			the galactic zoological catalog.
			There have been rumors of a
			species called allasomorphs which
			are supposed to possess the power
			to alter their molecular structure
			into that of other life-forms.
			Such a species would make a
			perfect "protector."
			I want a security team stationed
			outside Sickbay, Mister Worf.
			Aye, sir. Captain... if Anya
			transforms?
			Stop her.
			Remain here.
			You are restricted to these
			quarters for the remainder of this
			voyage.
			Can a place so remarkable truly
			exist?
			Oh, yes. And there are so many
			more -- all special - -all so
			different. And all the different
			kinds of life-forms.
			I have learned about them. That
			is all I did on Klavdia Three...
			was learn. I know so much, but
			I've seen so little.
			Then, think of what you have to
			look forward to. This is the best
			time to be alive.
			For you.
			For us both. Everything is just
			beginning. We've only charted
			nineteen percent of our galaxy...
			the rest is out there -- waiting
			for us. And already, look at
			what we've discovered.
			I have never seen anything so
			wondrous.
			Wait. Computer -- Rosseau Five.
			I can't believe a place like this
			really exists.
			Oh, yes.
			And you have been there?
			And one day you'll visit Rosseau
			Five... and other places and more
			spectacular than this.
			If only that were possible.
			Now, listen. In a moment the
			orbits of the moons will become
			synchronous.
			It is so beautiful -- like this
			place has a voice and is trying
			to talk with us.
			I never thought of it that way.
			Thank you for sharing all of this
			with me.
			Soon you'll see it for yourself.
			I don't think so.
			Maybe we should go.
			How about something to drink?
			How about some more of that
			Thalian chocolate?
			We have obviously brought a very
			dangerous life-form aboard this
			ship. I want to minimize the
			chances of another incident.
			Captain, whatever kind of
			life-form Anya may be,
			emotionally she is really Salia's
			mother.
			And the most dangerous animal is
			a mother protecting her young.
			Exactly.
			Captain, this is Anya.
			Yes?
			Salia is gone. Where is she?
			This has all been so wonderful.
			I'm not sure it's real.
			Believe me, the Ten-Forward room
			is not an illusion.
			Not that. I mean the way I feel.
			Tell her about her eyes.
			You won't find a better dish of
			chocolate on Thalos or Daled Four.
			I'm sure I won't...
			Is something wrong?
			I've had a great time being with
			you, Wesley.
			That makes you sad?
			When I was on Klavdia Three all
			I could think of was leaving that
			isolation.
			Is that what awaits you on Daled
			Four?
			Yes.
			But I thought you were going there
			to unite two groups which have
			been fighting.
			What else do you know?
			Very little. There is almost
			nothing in the ship's computer
			about Daled Four. What will you
			do there?
			Your language has no word for the
			position I will hold. I only know
			I will have a lot of duties when
			I get there. In many ways I'll
			have even less freedom than I did
			on Klavdia Three.
			You could stay.
			On the Enterprise?
			Why not?
			Because...
			Just because a girl runs out,
			doesn't mean she's not hoping
			you'll follow.
			What is it? What happened?
			Salia!
			Stay away from me!
			I'm sorry.
			I don't understand.
			Wesley, I can't stay here! I
			can't have this life! I want it
			more than anything, but I can't
			have it!
			Salia, nothing is impossible!
			Not for you.
			There's a way. I know there is!
			Leave her alone!
			Wesley, step away from her.
			Come with me.
			Energy depletion level.
			Zero.
			LaForge to bridge.
			Yes, Lieutenant?
			I have just completed the final
			adjustments. Thank you for giving
			me the time. You now have warp
			engines available.
			Very good.
			Get us there as quickly as
			possible, Number One.
			Ensign Gibson, warp eight point
			eight.
			Warp eight point eight, sir.
			Estimated time to Daled Four?
			Three hours -- nine minutes.
			Ensign Crusher, when you have
			completed your duties in
			Engineering... report to my Ready
			Room.
			Yes, sir.
			The woman Anya is not what she
			appears to be. She is an
			allasomorph.
			A shape shifter?
			Yes. She is not just the
			governess, she is also the girl's
			protector. I don't like to
			interfere in personal
			relationships of anyone under my
			command, but...
			You want me to stay away from
			Salia.
			Yes, I do. For the good of the
			ship and the safety of everyone
			on board.
			I will do as you ask.
			Why won't you let me have a
			friend?
			It's my duty to protect you from
			danger.
			There's no danger here!
			There's always danger from one
			who is not your kind. Salia, he's
			confusing you. He'll lead you
			from your duties.
			Whether I see Wesley is for me
			to decide!
			It is not! I raised you, I
			protected you... and I intend to
			deliver you to Daled Four!
			Maybe what you want doesn't matter
			any more!
			Please Salia, I know it's
			difficult. But you must do what
			you are destined to do.
			Standard orbit.
			Aye, sir.
			Open hailing frequencies, Mister
			Worf.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			Sir, it is unlikely that Daled
			Four will respond.
			Explain.
			The troposphere appears to be
			absorbing our signals. It is
			fascinating, Captain. Klavdia
			Three and Daled Four have almost
			identical atmospheres.
			Magnify. Times twenty.
			The physical resemblance to
			Klavdia Three is striking.
			Remarkable... How could anyone
			live in an environment so totally
			hostile to human life?
			Apparently Klavdia Three was
			chosen for Salia because these
			conditions are important for their
			species's survival.
			Possible, Mister Data.
			Or else... they just wanted her
			to feel at home.
			Come in.
			Salia!
			You shouldn't have come.
			Do you want me to leave?
			I didn't say that.
			Then you want me to stay.
			Does Anya know you're here?
			That doesn't matter.
			I'm glad you came. I thought
			Anya would have kept you with
			her.
			I have certain rights.
			In other words, you slipped away.
			While Anya was asleep.
			I'm sorry if you got in trouble
			with your captain.
			I'm not in trouble... yet.
			Anya was afraid you would corrupt
			me.
			With my wild way of life?
			Maybe... with the normal things
			people do... when they like each
			other.
			Security to crew quarters!
			No... Anya... NO!
			You should not have disobeyed me.
			I had to.
			I warned you to leave her alone.
			You are not supposed to be here.
			We are leaving.
			Escort them both to their
			quarters. And secure it with
			a forcefield.
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			Since Anya's powers of
			transformation apparently gave
			her the ability to escape her
			guards unnoticed, we have sealed
			her quarters with a forcefield
			that will contain her no matter
			how small a form she may take.
			Meanwhile we remain unable to
			communicate with Daled Four.
			Captain -- I'm receiving an audio
			signal.
			Audio on.
			Come in...
			This is...
			of Daled Four.
			Sir, sensors indicate the
			communication originated from a
			gigawatt source on the planet.
			That's more power than our entire
			ship can generate.
			It is what is needed to penetrate
			the atmosphere.
			Which means we lack the ability
			to respond...
			Captain, there are beam-down
			coordinates encoded within the
			carrier signal.
			Splendid.
			I'll arrange for our guests to
			beam down.
			Come in.
			We have arrived.
			Salia will be with you in just
			a moment.
			You're not going?
			No. My duties have been
			completed. I have done all that
			I could. I hope it's been enough
			and that I did not fail you.
			You raised me well, and I thank
			you for that.
			Don't be angry at me. I would
			not have harmed the boy, I only
			wanted to frighten him.
			I know.
			You are ready for what awaits you
			and you will do well. I know that
			I have been tough on you, but it's
			because I want you to be prepared
			for whatever you may be required
			to do.
			Will I ever be able to leave Daled
			Four?
			Probably not. But, anything is
			possible.
			That's what Wes said.
			I hope he is right.
			Where will you go?
			The third moon is within range
			of this ship's transporter, I will
			go there.
			I am going to miss you.
			I know.
			I am ready.
			Computer - field off.
			Wesley.
			Was it fun?
			What do you mean?
			Playing humanoid. Was it fun?
			Wesley, look at me. Right now
			-- this moment -- this is what I
			am. A humanoid girl.
			But what are you really?
			Does it matter?
			Yes.
			I'm sorry I hurt your feelings
			-- I didn't mean to.
			I loved you.
			I love you, too.
			Can you?
			Yes, oh... yes. I have the same
			feeling -- the same emotions as
			you. It's time for me to go.
			Prepare to beam Salia to the
			specified coordinates.
			Aye, sir.
			Our world is grateful for the
			courtesy which you have
			extended us.
			I hope some day Daled Four and
			the Federation will have formal
			contact.
			That is my wish as well.
			Coordinates set, sir.
			Proceed.
			Wait!
			A taste to remember me by.
			I wish there were something I
			could give you.
			You already have.
			I'm glad you came to say good-bye.
			Thank you... for everything.
			I want you to leave now.
			Why?
			Because I cannot arrive on my
			planet in this form and I want
			you to remember me as I am now.
			We have had enough disguises
			between us. It's time for the
			truth.
			Energize.
			Seeing her on the transporter
			pad was like seeing pure light.
			I miss her. I feel so empty.
			I know that sensation.
			I'm never going to feel this way
			about anyone else.
			You're right.
			I didn't expect you to say that.
			Oh, there will be others -- but,
			the next time you feel love will
			be different. Each time is
			different.
			Knowing that doesn't make it any
			easier.
			It isn't supposed to.
			I better get back to my duties.
			Me too.
			We have the course set for
			Aldebaran Zeta, Sir.
			Mister Crusher, set speed -- warp six
			point five.
			Done, Captain.
			Engage.
