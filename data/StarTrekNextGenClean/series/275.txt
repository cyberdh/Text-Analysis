"I have bedimm'd the noontide sun,
call'd forth the mutinous winds,
and 'twixt the green sea and the
azur'd vault set roaring war: to
the dread rattling thunder have I
given fire, and rifted Jove's
stout oak with his own bolt; the
strong-bas'd promontory have I
made shake and by the spurs
pluck'd up the pine and cedar;
graves at my command have wak'd
their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em
forth by my so potent art."
"But this rough magic I here
abjure; and, when I have requir'd
some Heavenly music -- which even
now I do -- to work mine end upon
their senses, that this airy charm
is for, I'll break my staff, bury
it certain fadoms in the earth,
and deeper than did ever plummet
sound -- I'll drown my book."
Captain, your attention is...
wandering.
I can barely see.
Sir, I am supposed to be
attempting a Neo-Platonic magical
rite -- the darkness is
appropriate to such a ritual.
This is a play, Data. The
audience has to see you.
Perhaps I have been too... literal
with respect to my set design.
Computer. Modify Holodeck program
Data seven-three, Shakespeare's
The Tempest, Act Five, scene one.
Increase torchlight by twenty-percent.
Much better.
Would you like to try it again?
Yes, sir... but I am not certain
I fully understand the character
of Prospero. I would appreciate
any insights you may have which
would improve my performance.
Well... Shakespeare witnessed the
end of the Renaissance and the
birth of the modern era. Prospero
found himself in a world which no
longer had any use for his
powers...
Here he is about to perform one
final creative act before giving
up his art forever.
There is certainly a tragic aspect
to the character.
Yes, but he had a certain...
expectancy as well. A hopefulness
about the future...
Shakespeare enjoyed mixing
opposites...
Past and future... Despair and
hope...
Data, is this part of your
program?
No, Sir.
Then what is it?
It appears to be a steam
locomotive.
A train?
If I am not mistaken.
Computer, end program.
Computer, end program...
Captain, you are injured...
It's just a scrape... I'll have it
seen to...
The train we encountered is from
one of Doctor Crusher's Holodeck
programs. It is a re-creation of
the Orient Express, a train which
ran from Paris to Istanbul from
the late nineteenth century until --
Yes, yes, I know about the Orient
Express... but what was it doing
on Prospero's Island?
There appears to have been a
malfunction in the Holodeck's
database retrieval system. The
two programs were somehow
temporarily linked together.
Could this malfunction affect the
other Holodecks as well?
It is a possibility. I would have
to run a diagnostic to be certain.
All right, get to it. And shut
down all of the Holodecks until
you're finished, just to be on the
safe side.
Aye, sir.
I never realized you were
interested in trains. Did you
know that at its peak, the Orient
Express carried over ten thousand
passengers a year?
It's not really the train itself
I'm interested in...
Then what?
The experience.
The Orient Express was... mystery
and romance. It was an elegant
way to see exotic places and meet
fascinating people...
Did you know that on one trip,
both Sigmund Freud and Gertrude
Stein just happened to be on the
same car? They ended up having
dinner together every night.
I wonder what they talked
about... ?
Why don't you take a trip
yourself... and find out?
Riker to Picard.
Picard here.
All sections are ready to begin
the survey, sir.
Very good. I'm on my way.
Think about that trip, Jean-Luc...
You never know who you'll meet on
the Orient Express...
Captain's Log, Stardate 47869.2.
After weathering an unexpected
magnascopic storm in the Mekorda
Sector, we are continuing our
search for new Federation colony
sites.
I don't see any possibility of
developing sites in this region.
Most of the stars are mainsequence
binaries with no M-class
planets.
All right then, let's move on to
the next survey region... Have
stellar cartography begin a--
Mister Data, report.
The ship has gone into warp, sir.
Who gave the command?
Apparently no one. Helm and
navigation controls are not
functioning.
Our speed is now warp seven-point-three
and holding.
Picard to Engineering. Mister La
Forge, what's going on down there?
I don't understand it, sir. The
impulse systems suddenly cut out
and the warp drive kicked in.
Geordi, can you take the engines
off-line?
I'm working on it...
Data, what's our heading?
Bearing one-eight-seven mark four.
I am unable to determine our
destination -- but we are heading
away from the Mekorda sector.
Captain, the computer's locked-out
all the propulsion controls... I
can't access any of the
overrides...
If you want us to stop, we'll have
to do an emergency core shutdown...
That'll leave us without warp
power for more than a week...
Begin the procedure, Mister La
Forge...
We are no longer at warp...
Impulse power has resumed... all
systems show normal.
Where are we?
We are approximately thirty-billion
kilometers from our
original position.
Good work, Geordi.
It wasn't me that took us out of
warp, sir. I didn't have time to
complete the shut-down
procedure...
Well, I want an explanation.
Picard out.
Have you found anything, yet?
Only that we've got more than one
mystery here, sir...
We still don't know why the ship
jumped into warp... but it looks
like we're lucky it did.
There was a theta flux distortion
building up around the ship.
Why didn't the sensors alert us?
Our sensors were never designed to
detect theta flux distortions.
And yet -- there is a record of
the distortion in the sensor log.
That's the other mystery.
One fact is clear, however. The
distortion was gaining in
strength. If we had remained at
our original position one-point
seven seconds longer, the
distortion would have ruptured our
warp core.
If the Enterprise hadn't jumped
into warp when it did... we
would've been blown to pieces.
I just don't get it, Data. What
could have caused the engines to
jump into warp drive on their own?
Perhaps the engines were activated
by a random power fluctuation.
Which occurred just in time to
save the ship?
It is improbable... but it is
possible.
Well, I don't think I'm ready to
start believing in luck.
There is another possibility. The
sensors apparently detected a
dangerous anomaly that threatened
the Enterprise. It is possible
that they triggered a safety
response which caused the ship to
avoid destruction.
But there's no direct link between
the sensors and the warp
engines...
What is this... ?
It's some kind of new circuit
node... and it's connected to at
least half a dozen points in the
sensor array...
It appears to be connected to
several other systems as well...
including the warp control
circuits.
I guess there is a link between
the sensors and the engines after
all..
A force field... where did that
come from?
I am not certain -- possibly from
the node itself.
Well... wherever it came from...
it sure doesn't want us messing
with that node.
It appears to be protecting
itself.
We found these "nodes" in several
systems around the ship. At some
level, they were all connected to
each other.
There were nodes linking the
sensors to our warp control and
defensive systems. We believe
this is why the ship jumped to
warp.
When the sensors detected danger,
the defensive systems reacted to
the threat -- and activated the
warp engines to protect us.
Where did these nodes come from?
It is possible that the
magnascopic storm we recently
experienced had an unexpected
effect on the ship's systems.
Wherever they came from, they seem
to be multiplying.
As they increase, it will become
progressively more difficult to
control the ship.
What do you propose we do?
Well, it's not going to be easy to
get rid of them.
When we attempted to examine the
circuitry of one of the nodes, it
generated a force-field to keep us
out.
Whatever's going on here -- our
first priority is to get back
control of the ship.
Agreed...
All of the nodes intersect in
Holodeck three. It appears to be
a... focal point of some kind.
We might be able to find a way to
use the Holodeck circuits to
disable the nodes...
All right. Let's do it.
Commander, the Holodeck appears to
be in operation.
I thought you shut down the entire
system.
I did. However, it has reactivated
itself... and it will
not disengage.
Which program is running?
Several different programs appear
to be running simultaneously.
Well... this should be
interesting...
You weren't kidding, Data...
No, sir. I estimate that this...
scene consists of portions of at
least seven distinct Holodeck
programs...
See if you can access the circuits
that have been affected by the
nodes.
Tickets please... please have your
tickets ready...
You know, I've never even been
away from home... and now I'm
goin' all the way to Vertiform
City!
Very nice, sir. Enjoy your trip.
Tickets please... please have your
tickets ready...
Commander...
We have located a large
concentration of nodes behind this
wall... They appear to be
connected directly to the
Holodeck's main power coupling.
All right... go ahead and
depolarize the entire power grid.
Get away from there...
Would you gentlemen care to show
me your tickets?
We... left them in our
compartments.
I told you to bring the tickets.
I... forgot.
I don't think you folks belong on
this train...
You leave these people alone!
They're only trying to help!
Get back to the engine. This
doesn't concern you.
They're trying to hijack the
train...
Hey, if you're the Engineer, then
who's doing the drivin'?
I am.
I'm all right...
It looks like the navigational
relays overloaded...
I believe we have changed
direction...
Now we're on the right track!
Ladies and Gentlemen... we are on
our way!
Picard to La Forge. What's going
on? We just went into warp...
We've lost engine and helm control
again, sir... but this time,
they're completely burned out.
I don't know if we can stop the
ship.
I was right -- he was tryin' to
make off with my brick.
You take good care of that -- we
can't afford to lose it.
Are you people going to leave...
or are we going to have to throw
you off this train?
According to my tricorder, the
Holodeck safeties have been
disengaged. His weapon could be
lethal.
All right... let's get out of
here.
The number of systems now affected
by the nodes has grown
considerably.
Sensors, engines, replicators,
propulsion... they are all working
together now, almost independently
of the main computer. And the
nodes link all of them through the
Holodeck.
But why the Holodeck? That
doesn't make any sense.
Commander, I think what happens on
the Holodeck has a direct effect
on the ship. When we attempted to
destroy the nodes -- the
characters on the train responded
immediately to stop us.
And when the Engineer tried to
protect us -- one of the
characters shot him.
The Conductor then signalled for
the train to change directions...
and at approximately the same time --
-- the Enterprise took off in a
new direction, too.
Are you saying... that the ship is
being controlled by the Holodeck?
Not precisely.
Geordi, does the configuration of
the connection nodes look familiar
to you?
Yeah... it's... a little like the
structure of your positronic
brain.
That is correct. It appears that
the nodes are in the process of
creating a rudimentary neural net.
Data -- what are you suggesting?
Unlikely as it may sound... I
believe that the Enterprise may be
forming an intelligence.
This is a synaptic map of the
human neo-cortex...
This is a cross-section of my
positronic net...
And this is a schematic of the
connection nodes linking the
ship's systems...
I believe some sort of neural
matrix is forming on the ship. It
is still relatively primitive, but
it is an intelligence nonetheless.
How could this happen?
I believe it is an emergent
property.
Explain.
Complex systems can sometimes
behave in ways that are entirely
unpredictable. The human brain,
for example, might be described in
terms of cellular functions and
neuro-chemical interactions.
But that description does not
explain human consciousness -- a
capacity that far exceeds simple
neural functions.
Consciousness is an emergent
property.
In other words, something that's
more than the sum of its parts...
Exactly.
How does that explain what's
happening to the Enterprise?
The Enterprise contains a vast
database of information which is
managed by a sophisticated
computer. This complex system
gives the ship many of the
characteristics of a biological
organism.
That's true... it "sees" with its
sensors... "talks" with its
communications systems...
In a sense, it even "reproduces"
with the replicators...
And you think the ship has somehow
gone beyond those functions... has
developed a new capacity...
Yes, sir. I believe a self-determining
intelligence is
emerging.
If that is so... what does the
ship want? Where is it taking us?
I believe the key to understanding
the ship's behavior lies in the
Holodeck.
All of the connection nodes
intersect at that location. It is
clearly some kind of processing
center.
Processing center... ?
Yes, sir. A focal point... where
all the ideas and instincts of
this emerging intelligence are
first expressed in some form.
Almost like an "imagination... "
Sir, I'd like to go to the
Holodeck. I could interact with
the characters... maybe find some
clues that would help us
understand what's happening.
Very well. Mister Data, Mister
Worf, you'll go along. See if
there's any way to re-establish
control of the ship without
destroying the nodes.
If this ship truly is an emerging
intelligence, then it's our
responsibility to treat it with
the same respect we would give any
other being.
Welcome aboard, Counselor...
If you will distract these people,
I will attempt to depolarize the
power grid.
Have you finished the puzzle yet?
Not yet... but we're gettin'
close.
Do you recognize it?
No...
I'd like to help.
Tell me... exactly what are you
making?
What do you think we're makin'? A
puzzle!
No, I mean the picture. What is
it?
I don't know.
Can you deal me in?
Sorry. It's a two-man game.
Hey, hey, hey -- keep your hands
off that.
Is that why you killed the
Engineer -- to get this brick?
I had to get it back. You know
how much it's worth, lady?
Plenty.
And I gotta get it to Keystone
City.
Why? What's at Keystone City?
That's where everything begins...
Gin.
Are you succeeding, Commander?
I am ready to access the main
power grid.
Keystone City, next stop.
Well, look who's back.
We do not want any trouble, sir.
We are simply... passengers.
Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind
showing me your tickets?
Right. Sorry, boys... You're
getting off right here...
This is my stop.
Wait -- tell me what happens at
Keystone City. Why are you taking
the brick there... ?
I think we should follow that man.
That brick may be an important
clue...
Where did he go... ?
I can access the power grid here.
I will attempt to depolarize the
grid by using a low-frequency
inversion field. That may
disengage the nodes without
destroying them.
There he is. I'm going after him.
I am coming with you.
What are you doing here?
Laying the foundation...
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got
a train to catch.
I don't understand it, sir...
Cargo Bay Five suddenly started to
depressurize...
Did everyone get out in time?
Yes, sir, and I've re-established
the containment field... But I'm
reading massive power surges in
the Cargo Bay, and all sorts of
transporter activity...
There's something weird happening,
sir.
Get a team down there immediately.
I want to know what's going on.
Aye, sir.
La Forge to Bridge...
Picard here... what's going on?
I wish I could tell you...
That man said he was "laying a
foundation"...
But a foundation for what... ?
Troi to Data...
Data here.
How are you coming?
I encountered a minor difficulty,
Counselor...
But it has been dealt with. I am
ready to depolarize the power
grid.
It looks like the ship's
replicator and transporter systems
have been merged somehow...
they're working together to create
this... the question is, what is
it?
Ensign, I want to run a full
spectral analysis on --
I'm picking up a massive power
fluctuation... the ship's losing
structural integrity...
What's happening?
An earthquake... ?
Deanna!
La Forge to Data -- stop what
you're doing!
Acknowledged...
Data... I think we should get
together and compare notes.
The ship was protecting itself
again -- stopping us from
interfering. Whatever it's doing --
it intends to continue.
I'm betting it all has something
to do with the object that's
forming in the Cargo Bay.
I think he's right, Captain. Look
at the common themes that are
playing out on the Holodeck. A
puzzle being put together... a
foundation being laid... a paper
doll being fashioned. All images
of something being constructed.
And an object in the Cargo Bay
that's being constructed -- atom
by atom.
What is this object?
I have no idea. It's composed of
silica polymers, duranium, and a
few other compounds we can't
identify.
But creating it has put quite a
strain on our systems. Warp power
has dropped forty-seven percent...
Counselor, were you able to draw
any other conclusions from your
experience on the Holodeck?
Anything that might help us handle
this situation?
I think the Holodeck is what might
be called the ship's
"imagination." It's full of
fanciful, metaphoric imagery -- as
though it's having some kind of...
daydream. It may not make literal
sense... but symbolically there's
probably some kind of logic to it.
The characters you spoke to... do
they have any particular
significance?
I think they represent various
aspects of the ship. The
Engineer, for instance... may have
represented the navigational
system. The Gunslinger could be
the weapon system...
Is there any possibility that we
might be able to persuade them to
give back control of the ship?
I'm not sure it's possible to
reason with them. Many of them
seem genuinely unaware of what's
going on... and of their role in
it.
It's as though this emergent
intelligence is still an infant...
acting on instinct, trying to
figure itself out as it goes. The
only source of experience it can
draw on is ours -- through our
Holodeck programs.
Is there a way to... relate to
them on their own level...
influence their behavior in some
way... ?
Maybe there is.
I'd like to go back and try.
Deanna, the injuries you got on
the Holodeck could have killed
you...
And so far, we haven't been able
to re-establish the safeties.
I'm aware of that.
Go ahead, Counselor. But keep
this in mind... so far, we've
tried to thwart the ship in all
its efforts. And that's gotten us
nowhere.
Maybe it's time to try
cooperating.
You don't belong on this train!
Three for Vertiform City.
Guess I was wrong about you folks.
Welcome aboard.
What was that?
We've been having some problems...
the engine's running out of
steam... I hope we make it to
Vertiform City on time.
Is there anything we could do to
help?
Well, I could use a pair of strong
arms up in the Engine Room...
maybe we could get back on
schedule.
Why don't you go with him, Worf...
We'll do what we can here.
'Scuse me... are we goin' to get
there okay?
Of course we are. Don't worry
about a thing.
Now... I want you to tell me
everything you know about
Vertiform City.
Well... they got a restaurant
there... where you can eat all
you want, any time... it's the
best food around...
Well, there's the coal and there's
the boiler.
Sure obliged for your help.
Well done, sir. I think this will
make a difference, all right...
I don't know how or why, sir...
but power's almost back to normal
levels... life support systems
coming on line on all decks.
What's our heading?
It looks like we're on course
for... Tambor Beta-six. It's a
white dwarf star...
That's the way... keep it
steady... put your back into it!
The ship is using a modified
tractor beam to collect vertion
particles from the star.
Vertion particles... "Vertiform"
City. This is what the ship was
looking for...
Sir, the particles are being
routed through the transporter
system -- and into Cargo Bay Five.
Geordi... what's going on?
The object's absorbing vertion
particles, sir... and it's growing
even faster than before.
Sir... I'm picking up internal
energy emissions from this
thing...
What do you mean?
It's beginning to generate its own
energy...
Can you be more specific?
I'm picking up coherent
emissions... matter conversion...
it's incredible...
Wait, something's wrong... we've
got power fluctuations... the
vertion absorption rate is
dropping...
What's happening to the particle
beam?
The beam's exhausted the supply of
particles in the star... there's
nothing left to take out.
Captain -- the object's energy
output is decreasing...
Something's wrong...
What is it... ?
This was supposed to be
"Vertiform" City...
We've been on the wrong track all
along!
Are you all right?
Yes... what happened?
The Conductor accidently derailed
the train.
Data to Captain Picard...
Picard here.
We have had an accident in the
Holodeck. Has anything happened
to the Enterprise?
Yes -- a ship-wide shutdown.
We've lost attitude control and
most systems are off-line.
Captain, I think you better take
a look at this...
When the particle beam cut off,
the object was beginning to form
a coherent energy matrix...
... and if these readings are
accurate, I'd say the emission
patterns were almost... organic.
Are you suggesting that the
Enterprise has been attempting to
create... a lifeform?
I think so...
Will it... survive?
Its energy levels are dropping
rapidly... Unless it gets an
infusion of vertion particles
pretty soon... I don't think so.
Captain, our systems are back on
line... we're moving again -- at
warp nine.
Let's get back to the Bridge.
Whew... that was a close one,
wasn't it?
Where are we going now?
"New Vertiform City," of course.
Data to Captain...
Picard here.
The train has returned to normal,
sir...
... and our destination is "New
Vertiform City."
What's our course?
We're heading for the Cordannas
system.
Another white dwarf star?
Yes. It's the closest one to our
last position...
Captain, we've got a problem...
Even at warp nine, the Cordannas
system is over twelve hours from
here...
Will the object in the cargo bay
survive that long?
I think it will, sir, but that's
not the problem...
The ship's diverted all of our
systems to maximize propulsion --
including life support.
We've got less than two hours of
reserve oxygen.
Mister Data, we have to stop the
Enterprise. That means you have
to get control of that train.
Understood, sir.
The ship is looking for vertion
particles... and it believes that
the Cordannas system is the
closest source...
Is there another source --
something closer?
White dwarf stars are the only
natural source, sir.
Then what about artificial
sources? Is there any way to
create them?
How did the Conductor stop the
train?
There is a braking lever in the
engine room.
Let's go...
Sorry, folks. But you ain't goin'
nowhere.
I've narrowed the search to the
MacPherson Nebula, which is a
supernova remnant... or Dikonalpha,
a class-nine pulsar...
They're both fairly close to our
current flight path... and either
one might produce vertion
particles if we detonated a
modified photon torpedo inside it.
Vertions usually occur in
miniscule amounts. Do you think
either of these phenomena can
produce enough of them?
That's hard to say. I can't even
guarantee that we can create them
at all.
Well, we have to give it a try.
The nebula or the pulsar? It's
your choice, Mister La Forge.
I think we should go for the
nebula.
Very well. Begin the torpedo
modifications.
Now let's hope we can get the ship
to go where we want it to.
Please listen to me. We
understand what's happening. We
know you must get to New Vertiform
City.
And we want to help you get there.
I dunno...
Please. We're your friends.
Well... you're really gonna help
get us to New Vertiform City?
Yes. I promise.
Okay. But just one of you. The
rest stay here.
All right, that's far enough.
Sorry to spoil your party, pal...
it's nothing personal.
I can get us there more quickly.
I know a shorter route.
Don't listen to him -- he's up to
somethin'.
A shorter route... ?
Yes. If you will let me handle
the controls.
Don't do it!
We're behind schedule now... if he
could get us there on time...
Go on. But no funny stuff.
Data to Captain Picard...
I have taken control of the engine
room.
Stand by.
Are we within sensor range of the
nebula?
Yes, sir.
Mister Data, try to slow us to
impulse speed.
I will attempt to do so.
I sure hope you know what you're
doing...
Are the torpedo modifications
complete?
Aye, sir.
Launch torpedo.
It's working, sir... the
reaction's producing vertion
particles...
Well, what do you know... we're
here...
New Vertiform City...
The nodes are deactivating all
over the ship. Our systems are
beginning to function normally
again.
Then the purpose of the ship's
intelligence... was simply to
bring that life form into being...
There are entire species whose
sole purpose in life is to
reproduce. And when they finally
procreate... they die.
Captain, look...
Cheers.
Captain's Log, supplemental. The
Enterprise is back under our
control. All traces of the
emergent intelligence are gone...
and the object it created has
disappeared into space...
Come.
Captain, I am staging a scene from
The Tempest this evening for a
small audience. I would like you
to attend.
I'd be honored. Which scene?
Miranda's first encounter with
other human beings.
"Oh brave new world that has such
people in it."
It seemed appropriate.
Captain. You took a significant
risk in allowing the Enterprise to
complete its... task.
Why do you say that?
Because the end product was
unknown. The object could have
been dangerous. It may in fact,
be dangerous...
And I've allowed it to go off on
its merry way.
Yes, sir.
The intelligence that formed on
the Enterprise... it didn't just
come out of the ship's systems --
it came out of us. Our mission
records, our personal logs, even
our Holodeck programs -- our
fantasies.
If our experiences with the
Enterprise have been honorable...
Then can't we trust the sum of
those experiences to be the same?
