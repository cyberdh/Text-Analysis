Captain's Log, Stardate 46461.3.
The Enterprise has entered the
Ipai Sector, where we are
scheduled to deliver supplies to
a remote communication relay
station near the Klingon border.
Station forty-seven is still not
responding to our hails, Captain.
Should be two people aboard.
Lieutenants Aquiel Uhnari... and
Keith Rocha.
Life signs?
It is difficult to scan through
the concentrated subspace signals.
Mister Worf...
What is that noise?
They must've left the audio
monitoring system on! We're
hearing a few thousand subspace
messages! I'll try to shut it
off!
Commander...
It's coming from inside this
service duct... could be a loose
cover plate...
Here's your loose cover plate...
Hey there, pooch...
The shuttlecraft is gone. There
is no one aboard.
Commander...
What is it?
Cellular residue... I think it's
the remains of one of our
Lieutenants.
All of the blood traces I found
match Lieutenant Aquiel Uhnari.
For now I'll assume these are her
remains... but I'll need to take
the deckplate back to Sickbay to
make sure.
It would take a powerful weapon to
do this...
I'll have a better idea after I've
analyzed the deckplate.
If that is Lieutenant Uhnari...
Where's Rocha?
The station's shuttle is gone.
Maybe he took it.
Before Uhnari died... or after?
We're ready, Commander.
Any luck downloading the station
logs?
Not yet. I can't get past the
security lock-outs.
But I think I know why...
All encrypted subspace messages
are sent through this channel.
Look at the signal notation...
It's out of sequence.
I'd say somebody tried to by-pass
the access protocol and break into
the coded messages. It caused the
security lock-outs to freeze up.
Are there any messages missing?
I won't know until I can get into
the files.
I'm going to try accessing the
logs from another console.
Looks like you've made a friend.
Yeah...
We're going back to the ship. Let
me know as soon as you have
something.
Aye sir.
Riker to Enterprise. Four to beam
back.
Come on, girl...
All right... what do you say we
try repolarizing the interface...
This doesn't look like yours...
Is this what you're looking for?
Computer, run station logs in
sequence.
-- Log, Stardate 46458.3. Today
we configured the relay controller
grid. It was the last primary
system we had to overhaul. We are
scheduled to recalibrate and align
the antennae systems in the next
three days.
Computer, access visual output.
... sent in my third request for a
message delay buffer. Until it
arrives, Lieutenant Rocha and I
have rigged a memory module to
compensate. It'd better work...
or about a half million subspace
messages are going to end up
drifting through space.
Computer, open Uhnari
correspondence file.
Computer... access correspondence
files... Lieutenant Aquiel Uhnari.
Hello, Shianna. Sorry I haven't
talked to you in a while... but
I've been dealing with the new
Lieutenant, Rocha. So far he's
been rude, arrogant, and
condescending -- and he's only
been here two days. This might be
a long year...
Come on, Lieutenant... stick with
me...
-- I had the dream again. Mother
is calling out my name... she's
somewhere in the house... I get to
the top of the hill all right...
but then the house is slanted...
I'm still walking uphill. I can't
find her... doors everywhere and
they all look the same...
The cellular residue is completely
fused with the metal of the
deckplate.
We're trying to micro-vaporize the
metal... so I can get a clean DNA
sample.
Do you have any idea what killed
her?
Well... this is just a guess, but
from the molecular deposition on
the plating I'd say it was a highlevel
phaser blast.
Could it have been a Klingon
disruptor?
Possibly.
Geordi found evidence that the
encrypted messages might have been
tampered with.
We're pretty close to Klingon
space...
There hasn't been a Klingon raid
against the Federation in over
seven years.
I don't want to risk a diplomatic
incident until we have more
evidence.
And there's still the question of
what happened to Lieutenant
Rocha...
Get Rocha's personnel file from
Starfleet Command. And ask
Starbase Two-Twelve to help search
for that shuttle.
Aye sir.
Keep me apprised.
Alright... let's try this again...
The phase inducers are aligned...
this should be working...
Come on, Lieutenant... I know
you're in there somewhere...
Computer -- run a subsystem
diagnostic, with a frequency range
of ten to one hundred megahertz.
Diagnostic cycle will be complete
in twenty seconds.
Iced coffee.
What is it, girl?
Hello, Shianna. By the time you
get this... the Batarael will be
over. This is the first year I
haven't been there... I've been
wondering who's singing the Horath
in my place...
"Jomiael hahnalia ma marou nitalia
Rumael tavariel fatra di va
Jomiael Batarael... "
"continues to sing song - TBD"
"finishes song - TBD"
I had the dream again... the one
where Mother is screaming... I
climb the hill to our house... but
I can't get to her...
Shianna, this time I ran away. I
was so scared I ran back down the
hill...
I think I know why I've been
having dreams about danger... it's
because of what's been happening
with that Klingon.
He's getting more aggressive all
the time.
... it's because of what's been
happening with that Klingon. He's
getting more aggressive all the
time. Not just the usual
threats... Morag actually locked
his disruptors on the station this
time.
I don't really think there'll be
any trouble... it just gives me
those panic feelings... wanting to
run, wanting to get away from
danger.
Shianna, I couldn't say this to
anyone but you... but... the
panic... is the same thing I used
to feel when Father got angry...
when I knew he was going to punish
me...
Only now I'm out here in space and
there's no place to run.
There are at least three
references to a Commander Morag --
a Klingon officer who patrols this
section of the border. Apparently
he would pass the station every
few days and harass them.
Perhaps Morag was the one
interested in obtaining the
encrypted messages.
Could be. She didn't say.
I still have several days worth of
logs left to watch. Maybe I'll
learn more.
Very well. In the meantime, I'll
talk to the Klingon Governor about
Commander Morag.
Computer -- access Aquiel Uhnari's
personal logs.
Begin playback.
Shianna, you always said I'd look
great with a wig. So here it is.
What do you think?
Definitely not you.
Okay... maybe I'm getting a little
crazy... you would, too, if you
were on a relay station in the
middle of nowhere with no one for
company except an egomaniac like
Keith Rocha.
I took a big risk today... I
countermanded an order he gave...
I agreed to handle the com traffic
of Relay Station one-nine-four
while they shut down for
maintenance. Rocha said we
couldn't handle the additional
signal load... but I think he's
wrong.
When he finds out... he'll be
furious.
It's days like this that I wish I
was home. You know what I miss?
Muskan seed punch.
Real Muskan seed punch. I can get
it from the replicator... but it's
not the same. I'd give anything
for some of the punch Mother used
to make... with chunks of the
seeds still in it...
I had the dream again.
Keith? Is that you?
Commander... there are DNA traces
here. They are Klingon.
So Klingons did board the
station...
I have only found DNA from one
Klingon so far. I will continue
to scan.
How could she read this stuff... ?
How's it going?
I've managed to access all of
Lieutenant Uhnari's logs. I'm
looking for Rocha's now. Whatever
happened to the encrypted messages
had a cascade effect on the whole
storage system, and I can't find
any of his files.
Maybe Rocha didn't make the
official logs... Uhnari might have
been responsible for them.
I don't think so. Aquiel was the
junior officer.
"Aquiel"?
Lieutenant Uhnari.
I was up all night watching her
personal logs... I guess I'm
starting to feel like I know her.
What was she like?
Well... she was Hahliian... she
had one sister, named Shianna...
she drank muskan seed punch... she
had a sense of humor that I could
only describe as... "unique."
She loved to sing... and read...
... books of questionable taste.
Enterprise to Commander Riker.
Riker here.
The Klingon ship Qu'Vat has
arrived with Governor Torak.
Please report to the Observation
Lounge.
On my way, sir.
Torak claims to be bringing
evidence that the Klingons had no
involvement in the murder of
Lieutenant Uhnari.
Really. We just found evidence
that there was at least one
Klingon at the scene of the
murder.
This should be an interesting
meeting.
Governor Torak, sir.
Governor. Welcome aboard...
Do not bore me with your human
pleasantries. I told you we did
not kill the woman. Now I will
prove it to you...
ghoS! (Come!)
This is Lieutenant Aquiel Uhnari.
We were running a level two
diagnostic of the message
buffer... nothing special. Rocha
had been on edge all morning, but
he'd been irritable ever since he
got there, so I didn't think
anything of it...
We were mid-way through the
procedure... and suddenly... he
attacked me...
He grabbed me... and threw me
against the port bulkhead... I
yelled at him to stop, but he
wouldn't listen. He took me by
the throat... I broke free and
tried to get to the weapons
locker...
I'm not sure what happened next...
but somehow I got aboard the
shuttle and left...
We found her on our side of the
border heading toward Sector Two
Five Two Zero. She is lucky my
patrol ship did not destroy her
vessel on sight.
Lieutenant... why didn't you
contact Starfleet and report what
happened aboard the Station?
I... don't know, sir. Maybe I
passed out. I'm not even sure how
long I was in the shuttle before
the Klingons picked me up.
Forty-six hours.
You've been gone forty-six hours.
We assumed you were dead. Your
blood stains were found at the
murder scene.
I think I cut my head when he
threw me against the bulkhead.
Then the remains we found must be
Lieutenant Rocha.
I can't confirm that.
Until we can separate the cellular
residue from the deckplate, I
won't be able to get a clear DNA
scan.
You said you tried to get to the
weapons locker... is it possible
that you did?
No, I... I didn't.
You're sure?
I don't... exactly remember
everything after he attacked me...
I'm sorry. It's as if my memories
were... drained right out of me...
Your logs said that a Commander
Morag had been harassing you...
did you ever let him or any other
Klingon aboard the station?
Absolutely not.
If that is true, then Morag or
some other Klingon boarded the
station after she left.
We found Klingon DNA traces aboard
the station.
You still try to blame us!
Have the courage to admit your
mistakes. Or are you a lo'Be Vos?
At least I do not wear the uniform
of a P'tak!
Governor Torak... we are merely
exploring all the possibilities.
Lieutenant Uhnari's logs said
Commander Morag was harassing the
station --
He was doing his job!
If he was only doing his job, then
I'm sure you won't mind if we
speak with him.
Very well. In the interests of
diplomacy, I will allow you to
speak to Morag... but my patience
has limits.
Lieutenant... I know a friend of
yours who's very eager to see you.
Who?
Come on...
Maura! I was worried about you...
good girl...
Maura... so that's her name.
Yes, it's from "Cold Moon Over
Blackwater." Have you read it?
No... I'm not much for gothic
fiction.
Most people aren't nowadays.
Yeah... Maura got a little...
restless.
Maura, shame on you. This isn't
like you...
It's alright...
At least she's chewing them up in
pairs.
I'll arrange quarters for you.
I'm sure you'd like some time
alone...
Actually... I've been stuck on
that station for over nine
months... I wouldn't mind going
someplace with some activity.
I know just the place.
Have you ever tried Muskan seed
punch?
Yeah... it nearly made me sick.
You have to be raised on it. It's
very nutritious... and the taste
grows on you.
Batar al nalia. (But not on me)
You speak Hahliian?
Nelo, nelo... (a little, a little)
Your accent is wonderful... almost
flawless.
Thanks... I've always had a knack
for languages... probably because
my folks moved around so much...
We never travelled. My family has
lived in the same house for five
generations.
The one on the hill?
How did you know about that... ?
Well... to be honest... when we
thought you were dead... I had to
review your logs... and your
personal correspondence... for any
possible clues about what
happened.
All of it?
Most of it.
You have to remember... we thought
you'd been murdered. We needed
information.
I'm sorry... it's just that... I
say things to my sister that I
wouldn't say to anyone else. I
guess I'm feeling a little...
exposed.
I'd feel the same way.
Especially if I'd seen you in a
(TECH) wig...
I'm curious... now that you've met
me... am I what you expected?
I'm not sure. The woman I saw on
those logs is very complicated.
I think there's more to you than
meets the eye, Lieutenant.
In what way... ?
Your relationship with Rocha, for
example. He'd only been there
five days... but there was already
a lot of friction... and you
almost seemed to delight in doing
things that would upset him. Why
would you take on extra com
traffic... when you knew it would
make him angry?
Is that a personal question? Or
part of a murder investigation?
I don't know. Maybe both.
Keith Rocha was obnoxious from the
minute he reported for duty. He
treated me as though I were
beneath contempt.
I dealt with him the best way I
could. I felt like I had to
battle him just to hold my own.
But that doesn't mean I wanted him
dead.
Why do you think he attacked you?
I don't know.
Rocha's file is spotless. Two
decorations for valor... three
outstanding evaluations from his
previous commanders...
Doesn't sound like the same man
Lieutenant Uhnari described.
What have you found out about
Uhnari?
I checked into her record, too.
Her last posting was on Deriben
Five. I spoke with her commanding
officer there. He said she's
argumentative... quick to take
offense. He told me that he
transferred Uhnari to this relay
station because she was hampering
their efforts.
To be honest, sir... I'm beginning
to have doubts about her story.
Why?
I had Worf check the weapons
locker on the relay station...
there's a phaser missing.
You think she lied?
Lied... conveniently forgot... I'm
not sure. I just think it's
something we have to consider.
As of now, we don't have
sufficient evidence one way or the
other... I want you to examine her
shuttle... perhaps there's
something there which will shed
some light on her story.
Aye sir.
How much longer do you think the
investigation will take?
Hard to say. Maybe two or three
more days...
I know I'm a suspect in this
murder. Let me ask you
something...
You watched my logs... you know me
better than anyone here...
Do I seem like the kind of person
who could kill someone?
No.
I don't think I realized how much
I needed to hear that...
Aquiel... it's been a hard couple
of days... I think you need some
sleep.
You called me complicated...
you're right. And I don't make
friends easily...
Oumriel.
Oumriel...
I've managed to isolate the
cellular residue from the metal of
the deckplate. We've begun a full
spectrum tissue scan...
But something destabilized the DNA
to such an extent, that I can't
get a clear scan of it.
Could a high level phaser blast
have caused this kind of DNA
disruption?
Possibly. But it would take a
continuous burst of thirty to
forty seconds to cause this kind
of damage.
I'm going to try to reform the DNA
with a resonance frequency
burst... see if I can reconstruct
it to get an accurate scan.
Commander...
It is set to kill.
We found a type two phaser in your
shuttlecraft. It was taken from
the weapons locker on the station.
I told you I don't remember what
happened. Maybe I did get to the
weapons locker...
The phaser was set to level ten.
Standard procedure requires that
all phasers are set to level one
when they're in storage.
That means someone deliberately
changed the setting.
And there is the matter of your
conflict with Lieutenant Rocha.
Rocha and I had our
disagreements... but I would
never kill him...
Have you been able to remember
anything at all about what
happened after he attacked you?
No... nothing...
I... suppose it's possible...
maybe in self-defense I...
Doctor Crusher tells me that in
order to inflict the kind of
molecular damage found in Rocha's
remains... it would take a
sustained phaser discharge of at
least thirty to forty seconds.
That doesn't sound like "self-defense"
to me.
Wait a minute. We haven't even
established this phaser as the
murder weapon yet.
And even at level ten... I don't
see how a phaser could do what the
medical evidence says it did. A
subspace disruptor like a Klingon
weapon, maybe...
Look -- we're not here to make
accusations... Just to find out
what happened.
Commander Morag is due to arrive
in two hours. We'll see what he
has to say.
I'd like to go back to the
station... and try accessing
Rocha's personal logs again.
Good idea.
Geordi... wait a second.
This is off the record. I'm
saying this as your friend, not
your superior officer.
It might be best if you weren't
so... personally involved with
Aquiel right now. There's a lot
about her we don't know...
There's a lot about her that I do
know...
If she's innocent... I'd like to
help her prove it.
I think you're letting your
personal feelings cloud your
judgement.
I'm not the one making judgements.
Got it...

Captain's Log: Supplemental. The
Qu'Vat has arrived with Commander
Morag. We are preparing to
question him regarding his
involvement in the murder of
Lieutenant Rocha.
I killed no one!
We found your DNA on the consoles,
and on the bulkheads... we know
you were there.
Answer their questions.
Yes...
Yes, I was there. My patrol route
takes me near the station every
six days. Three days ago I hailed
them and there was no response.
I was... concerned.
Concerned... ?
Yes. I went aboard to see what
had happened. No one was there,
so I left.
And that's all?
That's all.
Commander Morag, we have
discovered that the encrypted
message bank on the station has
been tampered with. Our analysis
indicates that twenty-seven
priority Starfleet messages are
missing.
What of it?
Your DNA was also found on the
message control module.
This is outrageous! We will not
tolerate these accusations!
This is a... diplomatic matter,
Morag.
Do not make me searcn your ship.
Yes... I did take the messages...
Did you kill Lieutenant Rocha?
No. There was no one there. I
saw blood... and signs of a
struggle. I took the codes, but
I killed no one.
Governor, we would like Commander
Morag to remain aboard the
Enterprise until our investigation
is complete.
Take him.
This way.
Last night, after I dropped you
off at your quarters...
you established a subspace link
with this console...
You deleted some of Rocha's
personal file... didn't you?
Yes... I did.
Why?
I found... a letter Rocha was
planning to send to Starfleet
Command... about me.
The letter said I had become
belligerent... and insubordinate.
He was going to ask for a formal
hearing.
Geordi, I know how this looks...
Yeah -- it looks pretty bad.
I find out you've erased a letter
that contained a possible
motivation for murder --
I didn't kill him.
Then explain this...
I was afraid if they found the
letter... I'd be blamed for the
murder.
I'm not a model officer, I realize
that. Sometimes I act on impulse
instead of thinking things
through...
Aquiel... this really complicates
things...
What are you doing?
Getting out of here.
Aquiel... running away isn't going
to prove your innocence... facing
the situation will.
I'm scared, Geordi...
We'll get through this. I
promise...
Then... you believe me?
Yes. I do.
Alright. Initiate the resonance
frequency burst...
I'm starting to get a stable DNA
scan... this is odd...
The nucleotide sequences are
starting to fluctuate... the DNA
is becoming motile.
Let's try another frequency burst --
increase the resonance level by
twenty percent --
What is it... ?
We've... got a lot of work to
do...
I haven't felt this close to
someone in a long time... I don't
want to let go of it...
Me neither...
But we've got over six hundred
logs to go through...
Alright. But first... there's
something I want to share with
you. A way that we can become...
more intimate.
My people are partially
telepathic... we use something
called the Canar to help us focus
our thoughts.
We also use the Canar to establish
a stronger emotional link
during... love.
I was wondering what that was...
Do both of us have to be...
telepathic for it to work?
Let's find out.
Go ahead...
Think of me...
It's a perfect reproduction of my
hand -- all the way down to the
DNA structure.
You said it was formed from the
organic matter found in the
deckplate?
When I infused the matter with a
resonance frequency burst, it
activated the DNA. Then it
touched my hand... and started to
mimic my cellular structure...
Doctor... what exactly is this?
It's going to sound pretty farfetched...
Have you ever heard of coalescent
organisms?
No...
Rare microscopic lifeforms which
must absorb other organisms in
order to survive. Now, that's not
so unusual... but coalescents
become the organism they've
absorbed -- right down to the
cellular level.
Do you think that is what happened
with your hand?
There have been reports that these
organisms can exist on a larger
scale. What happened to my hand
seems to support that theory.
Are you saying that Lieutenant
Rocha was killed by one of these --
organisms?
It's possible it happened before
he reported for duty on the relay
station.
I do not understand.
I've checked the records. Just
before he was posted to the relay
station, Rocha served on an
outpost in the Triona System...
That's in a remote sector... maybe
he was absorbed by a coalescent
during that mission...
Then... what came aboard the
station, was actually an organism
that looked and acted like
Rocha...
How often must they change bodies?
The microscopic organisms have a
cycle of no more than five to ten
seconds. We can only assume a
larger, more complex coalescent
would have a cycle of at least
several days... or weeks.
If what you're saying is true...
Rocha attacked Uhnari because he
needed a new body...
Right.
But that means... Uhnari's now a
coalescent.
There was another person on the
station -- Morag. It is possible
he was the one who was...
absorbed.
Computer -- locate Commander Morag
and Lieutenant Uhnari.
Commander Morag is in his
quarters. Lieutenant Uhnari is
not aboard the Enterprise.
Where did she go?
Lieutenant Uhnari transported to
Relay Station Forty-Seven at
eighteen thirty hours.
You get Morag. I'm going to the
station.
Geordi... ?
I can see you...
And I can... feel you...
Do not move.
What is this -- ?
Come with us.
You've never been as close to
someone as you're about to be...
think of me...
Step away from him, Lieutenant...
slowly.
What is it, Commander?
That might not be Lieutenant
Uhnari...
What?
What are you saying?
Step away. Now.
Chief Medical Officer's Log,
supplemental. Commander Morag and
Lieutenant Uhnari are being kept
under close observation. So far,
no sign of coalescent behavior has
surfaced.
Uhnari and Morag will be
transferred to a secure medical
facility at Starbase Two-twelve.
Maybe we'll know more by the time
we get there.
Yeah... maybe...
It might be Morag... there's no
way to tell...
Right...
Get some rest. This has been a
tough couple of days...
Thanks...
Computer -- display the
Engineering duty roster for the
next three days.
Come on now... stop it...
Maura... ?
Maybe the reason you don't
remember what happened after Rocha
attacked you... is that the
coalescing process had begun...
remember you felt like the
memories had been drained right
out of you? That's probably just
what happened...
Then... maybe I did take the
phaser...
Whatever happened, at least you
got away.
So he turned on Maura.
Well. What now?
I guess I'll be going to Starbase
Two-Twelve for re-assignment.
You know... I had a talk with
Chief Pendleton in Communications.
There's an opening for a level two
specialist.
Really?
I'm sure there's a waiting list so
long I'd be grey before I got
here.
I could put in a good word.
It's an appealing offer...
But I think I'd rather get here on
my own merits.
Don't be surprised if you see my
name at the end of that list.
