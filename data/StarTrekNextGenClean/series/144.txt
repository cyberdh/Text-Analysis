Captain's log, Stardate 42823.2.
My meeting with Admiral James
Moore has offered me an
interesting proposal. We have
completed our repairs, and are
preparing to warp out.
Yes, sir?
Recognize that?
No, sir, I'm sorry, I don't.
It's an old style Terran distress
beacon. It kicked in last month,
and was detected by the starbase.
What's its origin point?
The Ficus quadrant.
Captain, there are no records of
an Earth colony in that area.
Admiral Moore has offered us the
task of investigating the signal.
And of course we've accepted.
Am I so transparent?
You've got that look in your eye.
Oh?
The lure of a mystery.
A lost Earth colony. That is an
exciting idea.
They may not have survived.
They're calling for help, aren't
they?
You're an optimist.
Always.
Signal analysis complete.
Distress beacon used by the
European Hegemony.
The European Hegemony?
A loose alliance that formed in
the early twenty-second century. It was
the first step toward a world
government. You should read more
history, Number One. Computer,
bracket exact dates when this
beacon was in general use.
Old Earth calendar, 2123 until
2190.
No extraterrestrial source has
ever used this beacon?
Negative.
Locate all Earth deep space
launches from 2123 until 2190,
and list their destinations.
Working.
Nothing for the Ficus quadrant.
Damn it, who's out there?
Guess we'll have to wait and ask
them.
How could a spaceship leave Earth
without some kind of a record?
Perhaps it was deliberate. They
may have wished to escape
detection.
You're suggesting they were
fugitives?
During the Eugenics Wars a group
of genetically superior humans
ruled the world. After their
defeat some did escape.
What do you think, Worf. Can we
handle supermen?
Medical emergency! Doctor Pulaski
to the bridge.
I am fine.
You are not fine, you fainted.
I did not faint. Klingons do not
faint.
Excuse me, I'll rephrase. This
Klingon suffered a dramatic drop
in blood pressure, his blood
glucose level dropped, there was
deficient blood flow resulting
from perpheral circulatory
failure, in other words he curled
up his toes and laid unconscious
on the floor.
Doctor, there is no need to insult
me.
Worf, I'm worried. Something's
wrong. Klingons don't faint --
forgive me, but I can't think of
another word which applies --
for no reason. You're sick.
Klingons don't get sick.
They sure do get stupid. Stay
there! I need to check something
with the computer.
Lieutenant, you've got rop'ngor.
Doctor, no one must learn that
I am suffering from a childhood
ailment!
I have to file a report.
But it is so humiliating!
Captain Picard.
Ah, Doctor, how is Worf?
He's in no danger. Worf was
observing a Klingon ritual
involving fasting, and he didn't
take into account that you need
to decrease physical activity as
you decrease caloric intake.
Pulaski out.
Come.
Sir, there is a discrepancy
between our requisition order
for display panels and the number
actually tendered by the
starbase.
How can something so simple
become so complicated?
Such is the nature of a
bureaucracy?
There's more than one way to skin
a bureaucratic cat.
Sir?
There's no record of a launch to
the Ficus quadrant. Not unusual
if you consider the chaos of the
early twenty-second century, but someone
had to load that ship.
Ah, yes, the manifest.
There it is. The Mariposa, launch
date November 27, 2123. Captain
Walter Granger, commanding.
Mariposa is the Spanish word for
butterfly.
Thank you, Data.
I thought it might be significant.
It doesn't appear to be. Ah...
and here is the cargo list.
You can tell a lot about people
from their luggage. Let's see,
two hundred and twenty five
Yoshimitsu computers, five
monitor beacon satellites, seven
hundred cellular commlinks, fifty
spinning wheels --
Spinning wheels? Accessing. A
device for spinning yarn or thread
that consists of a large foot or
hand driven wheel and one spindle.
Cattle, chickens, pigs. . . . not
DNA, the actual livestock.
Incredible. Why would anyone
carry such an insane mix of cargo?
Spindle -- a thin rounded tapering
rod --
Data!
Perhaps they were planning for
the worst.
In the early twenty-second century
Earth was recovering from World
War III. A major philosopher
of the period was Liam Dieghan,
the founder of the
Neo-Transcendentalists. He
advocated a return to a simpler
life in which one lived in harmony
with nature, and learned under
her gentle tutelage --
Thank you, Data. But if this was
a ship full of utopians, why
carry the technological baggage?
Sir, I have insufficient
information from which to form
a cogent theory.
I hate a mystery.
But, sir what about Dixon Hill,
and your penchant for detective
fiction --
Allow me to correct myself. I
hate a mystery I cannot solve.
I wished to thank you for
protecting my --
Your secret is safe with me.
Worf, I'm honored. No one has
ever made the Tea for me.
You know the ceremony?
I understand the externals. Not
the mysteries. I'm not a
Klingon.
You must not drink the tea. It
is deadly to humans.
And none too good for Klingons.
It is a test of bravery, of one's
ability to look at the face of
mortality. It is also a reminder
that death is an experience best
shared -- like the tea.
Worf, you're a romantic.
It is among the Klingons that
love poetry achieves its fullest
flower.
Hold that thought.
Antidote. If we're going to
share, let's share. Now, quote
me a little of that poetry.
Scans indicate human life form
readings thirty meters below the
planet's surface.
Hailing on all frequencies,
Captain. So far no response.
There is no evidence of an
advanced communication network.
But the comlinks?
There is no artifical power
source on the planet.
But they've got a monitoring
satellite.
A good thing, too. Without it
we would never have known they
needed help.
Captain, the stellar flares are
increasing in intensity and
frequency. Computer projections
indicate they will envelope the
planet in three point six hours.
Mister Worf, prepare for immediate
evacuation.
Evacuation will be difficult.
Our shields can be lowered for
transport only between the flares.
Captain, these people have been
isolated for three hundred
years. We cannot beam them to
the Enterprise without warning.
And if they have slipped back
into barbarism the experience
would scare them to death.
You'll have to go down there,
Number One.
On my way.
Captain's log, supplemental.
Commander Riker has reached the
caverns, but we are still waiting
to begin the evacuation.
What's the situation, Number One?
There are roughly two hundred
people down here.
Their condition?
Surprisingly good.
Are they willing to leave?
Yes, but --
Well, get them up here.
I'm having a little altercation
with the colony's leader.
I'm not interested, Commander.
Initiate the transport.
But, sir --
No arguments.
Aye, aye, sir, we're on our way.
All of us. Riker out.
Uh... Captain, you better get down
here.
Right away!
Ah, O'Brien, I should have known
that a good Irishman would be
running this ship, and not some
Frenchy.
Shoo! Shoo, damn you!
What the devil is going on
here?!
Oh, Picard is it. The man who
makes decisions for me and mine
without so much as a by-your-
leave.
Do you generally have him on a
leash?
My security chief, Lieutenant
Worf.
Danilo Odell, at your service.
I don't want your service, Mister
Odell. I want this damn
livestock off my ship.
You said you didn't want to waste
time arguing.
Captain, this damn livestock has
fed our children, been company
to the old and sick and playmates
to the young...
And can this man ever argue.
... I couldn't leave them to
die. Besides, how can we rebuild
without our animals?
Alright. Chief O'Brien, kindly
transport this group to Cargo
Hold Seven, and the remaining
refugees on the planet should go
directly into the hold so we can
stop dirtying my ship.
Yes, sir.
Back onto the infernal machine.
We're taking another little ride.
We've got to have a little talk.
Er... fine, and then Mister Worf
can show you the ship.
That would be grand. And Captain,
it was grand of you to resue us
from out troubles.
My pleasure.
You must be worth quite a bit to
own a ship like this.
I don't own the Enterprise, I
command her.
Whatever. Would you happen to
be married?
No. Why?
I have a daughter.
I felicitate you.
Would you be interested?
No!
You're sure?
Yes!
What is the colonists' overall
condition?
They're a little hungry, a little
scared, but hiding it well. They
were suffering from an amazing
variety of preventable diseases -- but
the transporter handled
that. They're also tough,
determined and fun. Overall,
I'd say they're charming examples
of homo sapiens at their best.
What's the total?
Two hundred and twenty-three.
Count on four more in the next
few days.
Next question, what to do with
them? Take them to a starbase?
They were anachronistic in 2123.
How will they cope?
There's no question they could
learn and adapt, but it would be
dislocating, and the colony would
probably be splintered. Maybe
we should be looking for a new
home for them?
Lieutenant Worf, report!
Fire in Cargo Hold Seven.
The Bringloidi!
I wonder what they've done to my
ship now.
Unseal the doors.
My God, Picard, the place is a
bloody death trap! Lightning
bolts falling from the ceiling!
What the hell was that thing?
Automated fire system. A force
field contains the flames until
the available oxygen within the
field has been consumed.
What if I had been under that
thing?
You would have been standing in
the fire.
Well, ignoring that for the
moment. What would have happened
to me?
You would have suffocated and
died.
Sweet mercy.
Your hospitality leaves a hell
of a lot to be desired! You don't
offer us a bite or a sup, and when
we build a fire to cook a little
something, the place goes mad!
My apologies, ma'am, I was unaware
that you had not been instructed
in the use of the food dispensers.
And what are you staring at? Have
you never seen a woman before?
I thought I had.
Commander, may I present my
daughter, Brenna Odell.
Very pleased to meet you, ma'am.
You may have all the time in the
world, but I've dozens of
frightened and hungry women and
children to care for.
What about the men?
I'm sure they'll find their
comfort as they always do -- in
the bottom of a mug of home brew!
Pay her no heed, she's a grand
girl. And not usually so...
er...
... sharp tongued.
Father!
Of all the reactions that's not
the one I expected.
Number One, there are times in
life when you have to simply bow
to the absurd.
How did the ship sense the fire?
The... ah... ship's computers
sense a localized increase in --
Men! Always talking when there's
work to be done.
Shouldn't you be flying this ship,
or whatever it is you do?
I think I'll go give her some
help, Captain.
That wasn't necessary. The ship
will clean itself.
Well, good for the bloody ship!
Where does a girl go to wash her
feet on this ship?
I think it's the responsibility
of the ship's first officer to
show that girl all the amenities.
She is very like a Klingon woman,
Captain.
My condolences, Mister Worf.
Ah, Captain, there's just one
other thing. It slipped my mind
in all the hustle and bustle --
The point, Mister Odell?
What are you going to do about
the other colony?
Other colony?
Captain's log, supplemental. A
review of stellar charts has
revealed a Class M planet, NB2323
only half a light year from the
Bringloid system. I am gambling
it was the destination of the
second colony.
Behave yourself.
You're a fine woman, and you've
made a young man of me.
No, I've cured your arthritis,
and if you try anything more
energetic you'll probably drop
dead.
I'd die happy.
Out.
You know how to handle men.
Yes, first you have to get their
attention.
How did you give Joey back his
hand?
Oh dear, that would be difficult
to explain.
Like everything else aboard this
ship. I'm too ignorant to
understand. And this is the one
thing that looks useful.
You're interested in medicine?
I'm healer and midwife. Or I
thought I was.
All I've every wanted is to take
away the hurt. These wonderful
tools help me do that, but
sometimes I feel more like a
mechanic than a doctor.
You've the hands of a healer.
You can't put that in a machine.
I'll leave you ladies to your
discussions. Dinner, Brenna?
I'll cook.
Is he real?
Oh, yes, very real.
William Riker, you're a mess.
You don't have to do that.
And if I don't, who will?
I can see why your father wants
to marry you off.
Oh, and why is that?
So he can have a pipe, and mug
of beer in peace.
You've shown me so many wonders
on your great ship, but there is
still one thing you haven't shown
me.
What's that?
I'm still waiting to wash my feet.
Through there. Glass of wine
while I cook?
William, is something wrong?
What do you mean?
Do you not like girls?
Of course I like... Oh... is there
a technique to this foot washing?
You generally start low... and
work your way up.
I think I can handle that.
I was hoping you might.
Feeling better, Worf?
Yes. And you, Commander?
Couldn't be better.
Status, Mister Data?
Warp factor five, continuing on
course for NB2323. E.t.a. eighteen
hours.
Excellent.
You sent for me?
We're brewing poteen, but we need
a way to heat it without this
bloody ship firing bloody
lightning bolts at us.
You can obtain spiritous liquors
from the food dispensers.
It's not that synthehol bilge
O'Brien offered me, is it?
No, if you wish it can be real
alcohol.
Good.
With all of the deleterious
effects intact.
As it should be.
You see, lad, every moment of
pleasure has to be purchased by
an equal moment of pain.
Whiskey.
Terrible.
It's got no bite.
Chech'tluth.
Now that's what I call a wee drop
of the creature.
Father!!
You remember that moment of pain?
Well, it's about to begin.
Hello, darling.
Darling is it! I might have
known!
Are you drunk yet, or can you talk
with Doctor Pulaski about the
children?
What about them?
She wants to send them to school
with the ship's children.
What do you think?
I think it's a good idea.
So go handle it!
And I'm sure there's something
you can be doing with your time.
And as for you...
What!
Why did you have to tell them that
this magic wall can give them more
than meat and potatoes? Now we'll
never get a lick of work out of
them.
Madam, have you considered a
career in security?
If it's anything like babysitting
-- I'm an authority.
Signal from the planet, Captain.
On screen.
This is Jean-Luc Picard of the
United Federation vessel USS
Enterprise.
This is tremendous! Welcome,
Captain, I'm Wilson Granger, prime
minister of Mariposa.
No doubt a descendant of Captain
Walter Granger.
Not quite a descendant.
We feared that Earth had suffered
a catastrophe when no one came
to check on us.
I'm afraid you were lost in the
bureaucracy, but despite the
lateness of our arrival we are
here now, and eager to renew ties.
Splendid! Please, come down, and
allow us to extend our hospitality
to you and your crew.
Number One, form an away team.
I would urge caution. Mister
Granger is hiding something.
We'll check it out. Mister Worf.
Doctor Pulaski join me in
Transporter Room Three for an away
detail.
Welcome to Mariposa. Victor
Granger, minister of health.
William Riker, Doctor Pulaski,
Lieutenant Worf.
I'll escort you to the prime
minister. This way please.
A brother?
Your arrival really is
serendipitous.
Oh, how so?
Well, perhaps I should leave that
for the prime minister to
explain.
Worf, stand by for immediate beam
out. There's something damn odd
down here.
Aye, Commander.
Is your title scientific or
medical?
Medical.
Ah, excellent.
Is there some medical problem we
should know about?
I think it best if the --
Prime minister explains that.
Somehow I thought you might.
Welcome to Mariposa.
Doctor Katherine Pulaski.
My chief of staff, Elizabeth
Vallis.
So, is your entire population made
up of clones, Prime Minister?
Clones?
Clones?
Clones.
Captain's log, supplemental. Prime
Minister Granger has requested
an urgent meeting to discuss the
future of the Mariposan colony.
Captain, we need your help.
Three hundred years ago during
our landing on Mariposa, the skin
of the ship was breached. Only
five colonists survived. The
progenitors weren't willing to
just give up and die, and they
were scientists --
So they used that expertise and
turned to cloning.
Yes. They had no other option.
Two women and three men were an
insufficient gene pool from which
to build a society.
How did you suppress the natural
sexual drive? Drugs? Punitive
laws?
In the beginning we used a little
of both. Now three hundred years
later the entire concept of
sexual reproduction is a little
repugnant to us.
A culture with no children.
It's economically more viable to
accelerate clone growth. Some
basic learning can be chemically
imprinted on the developing clone,
the rest we do after emergence.
How did you overcome the problem
of replicative fading?
We didn't.
You have got a problem.
Wait. I don't understand.
Replecative fading?
Each time you clone you're making
a copy of a copy. Subtle errors
creep into the chromosomes, and
eventually you end up with a
non-viable clone.
Yes. We're developing a sort
of mental hardening of the
arteries. It's increasingly
difficult to respond to new
situations.
How can we help?
We need an infusion of fresh DNA.
I was hoping that you would be
willing to share tissue samples
from your crew.
You want to clone us?
Yes.
No way. Not me.
How can you possibly be harmed?
It's not a question of harm. A
single William Riker is unique,
maybe even special. Hundreds or
thousands of them diminish me in
a way I can't explain.
You would be preserving yourself.
Human beings have another way of
doing that. We have children.
I think you will find this to be
the attitude of a predominate
number of Enterprise people.
I see. Well, if you will not help
us by sharing your DNA will you
at least send people to repair
our malfunctioning equipment?
Yes, of course. Number One, form
away teams, and get the repairs
underway.
Yes, sir.
Repairing the equipment is not
going to solve your problems.
What other solution do we have?
Remember, Doctor, there are only
five of us.
You sent for us?
Excuse me, sir, I was looking for
Commander Riker.
I'm afraid I haven't seen him.
Doctor Pulaski?
Sorry, I can't help you.
Guess I'll just have to hunt for
them. Sorry to disturb you.
And after a long and gentle sleep
we awoke and there was Bringloid,
our dream world. Our companions
in the butterfly ship left us
off, and said they would leave
a guard in heaven to look out for
us.
They flew on in the darkness -- their
search was not yet over -- but
we had found the sun, a
world, a home.
And now we have lost it.
We'll find another.
When? How long must we wait and
journey?
I finally understand. That
distress satellite was left by
the Mariposans as a way to protect
the Bringloidi. There were two
colonies on that ship.
Interesting, Captain.
And not terribly relevant, I know.
Still, it gives one pause for
thought....
What happened on Mariposa? Are
you all right?
Is there some reason why we
shouldn't be?
Yeah, every time I asked where
you were, some clone lied to me.
Lied to you?
Commander, with this I can see
a lot more than your average
person. When people lie there
are certain physical
manifestations; variations in
blush response, pupil dilation,
pulse and breath rate. I can't
use the VISOR on aliens, but
humans -- I've got them nailed.
And the clones lied about our
whereabouts?
Yes.
I don't remember anything
happening. I was working in
their medical facility when I got
a call to report to Granger's
office. I ran into Will on the
way and --
Granger said he hadn't seen
either of you. Did you get to
his office?
I don't remember.
So what's the prognosis, Doc?
Will I ever play the piano again?
Geordi, you'll be pleased to know
that you aren't missing any
epithelial cells.
Great.
Will and I, however, are.
Meaning?
Although you can clone from any
cell in the human body the cells
lining the stomach are the best
choice because they're relatively
undifferentiated.
Where are you going?
To that cloning lab.
I don't suppose you'd believe this
was an accident?
Murderers!
Like hell! You're a damn thief!
Gentlemen, please.
What else could we do? We asked
for your help and you refused!
We're desperate. Desperate!
So that gives you the right to
assault us, and rob us, and --
We have a right to survive!
Doctor, how desperate is the
colony's situation?
They've got two maybe three more
generations, then the fading will
become terminal. They're the
walking dead now, they just
haven't been buried.
I want that cloning equipment
inspected. Who knows how many
tissue samples they've stolen.
I have the right to exercise
control over my own body.
You'll get no argument from me.
I know the Mariposan culture seems
alien, even frightening, but we
really do have much in common.
They're human beings fighting to
survive. Would we do any less?
Are you saying we should give them
the DNA samples they require?
That's just postponing the
inevitable. So they get an
infusion of fresh DNA -- fifteen
generations and they're back to
the same problem. Cloning isn't
the answer. They need breeding
stock.
The Bringloidi.
The Bringloidi have energy and
drive, a sense of wonder. The
clones possess emotional maturity,
and technological know-how.
They started out together. It
does seem only fitting that they
end up together.
It's a match made in heaven.
Unfortunately it's going to be
a shotgun wedding.
I'm sorry, Captain, but it's out
of the question. You're trying
to dump your problem off on us.
And we've got problems of our own.
Can't you understand? The
Bringloidi can help you.
Look at him. How could we ever
integrate that into our society?
You're no prize yourself.
Primitive, hostile, disruptive.
It would require enormous effort
to even educate them.
Forget it, Captain Picard. I'm
not coming with my hat in my hand
to beg charity from this bastard.
Sit down! I am not going to allow
brag...
... and bigotry...
... to destroy this meeting.
Commander Riker wants your
laboratories inspected for any
stolen tissue. I can understnad
his concern, and I think we're
going to have to transport all
of your equipment to the
Enterprise.
I see, when reason fails you'll
resort to blackmail.
All right, die!
It's not so bad, Captain. In
fifty years we'll have a new
Class M planet, complete with
cities, all ready for
colonization.
The end is closer than you'd like
to think.
I don't know. The difficulties
involved...
Look, man, we're decent, hard
working people. We're willing
to learn.
They're so different.
Yes. But it's differences which
have made us strong.
An open society is a healthy
society. When you allow your
culture to become a melting pot
it grows in exciting directions.
For three hundred years we've
denied the carnal side of our
nature. How can we learn to put
that aside?
You put a couple of young people
together and you let nature take
its course.
To make this work you're going
to have to alter your society,
too. Monogamous marriage won't
be possible for several
generations.
I'm not sure I follow.
Thirty couples are enough to
create a viable genetic base.
But the broader the base the safer
and healthier the society. It
would be best if each woman -- Mariposan
and Bringloidi -- had
at least three children by three
different men.
I think I could handle that.
God, this is so... so...
Frightening?
Repugnant.
The normal drives are still there.
You're just going to have to alter
your attitudes.
So, it's a done deal?
My hand on it.
Now come on, I want to stake out
my three ladies. Send in the
clones.
I must be out of my mind.
Starfleet's probably going to
agree.
Isn't that just like a man! You
make these grandiose decisions,
but you never stop to consider
the poor women.
Miss Odell, I am --
You men draw a mug, and solve all
the world's problems while the
beer goes down. But when it comes
to the practical matters it always
falls to the women to make your
grand dreams come true.
Miss Odell, you're the one who
wanted a new home.
But I don't know if I want to
be Eve!
That is your choice. If you wish
to stay aboard the Enterprise we
will drop you at a starbase, and
you can go where you will.
Leave my dad?
Brenna, you've always been the
mothering force for your people.
If this is going to work they'll
need your wisdom and guidance.
But my life has just gotten very
narrow.
We have to make choices.
Oh, damn.
What does he do again?
He's the prime minister.
Sounds important.
It is.
Sounds like he might have more
than two coins to rub together.
Three husbands?
All squared away?
The Bringloidi have reached their
new home.
It is unfortunate that we cannot
remain for several months, and
observe the integration of the
two colonies.
They're going to do just fine.
They're survivors, both of them.
We've done what we could. We've
put the cats in the same sack,
and given it a good shake.
But what is occurring on Mariposa
is a demonstration of
sociobiology, and the concept of
the selfish gene.
Males and females are each
pursuing their respective
reproductive strategies in an
effort to maximize their
contribution to the gene pool of
the next generation.
Data, I liked the captain's
analogy better.
Why?
It was more romantic.
How are cats in a sack romantic?
They would fight and scratch
and...
Very romantic. I hunt in darkness.
The stars my guide. The memory
of you sings in my blood. I seize
the gift.
Carry it to your bower. And lay
at your feet the hearts of my
enemies.
Engage.
Perhaps it does not translate
well.
