Deanna Troi Personal Log: Stardate
47611.2. I have spent the last
three days attending a reunion of
my graduating class at the Carvin
Institute for Psychological
Studies. It was a very... thought-provoking
experience.
Send a message to Commander Data
and inform him of our delay.
Aye, sir.
Deanna... welcome back.
Thank you. I just wanted to
report in. I didn't expect to
find anyone up except Data.
Data's away on assignment. A
Federation deep space probe went
off course and crashed on Barkon
Four. Some of the material in the
casing is radioactive, so Data was
sent to recover it before it
contaminates the biosphere.
Isn't Barkon Four inhabited?
There's a pre-industrial society,
but the probe crashed over a
hundred kilometers from the
nearest settlement. Data won't
have to make contact with any of
the Barkonians.
How was the reunion?
Fine. It was good to see some old
friends... I'd fallen out of touch
with most of them.
It was interesting to see the
different paths some of their
lives have taken...
Beverly... you don't usually stand
a watch on the Bridge even when
Data's not here... why this time?
I volunteered tonight. I like to
get in a little Bridge time now
and then... stay on top of
operations... tactical
procedures...
And the truth is... I like it.
Not every doctor gets to command
a starship... even if it is only
the night shift.
May I ask you a personal
question... what made you decide
to become a commander?
I mean, you didn't need the rank
in order to be Chief Medical
Officer... so why put yourself
through all the extra work?
I don't know... I never gave much
thought to my rank for a long
time... it seemed pretty trivial
compared to being a doctor.
But then, about eight years ago,
I began to feel like I wanted
to... stretch myself a little.
Commander... there's been no
response from Commander Data to
our signal.
Continue sending him updates on
our schedule.
Aye, sir.
Is something wrong?
No. I wanted to let Data know
that we'll have to delay picking
him up for a couple of days. We
have orders to rendezvous with the
Lexington and take medical
supplies to the Taranko Colony.
But he's not responding.
Geordi said the radiation from the
probe would probably interfere
with communications... I just
thought I'd try anyway. I'm sure
he's fine... it's a very routine
mission.
... so when you return from school
tonight, I'll be meeting with the
Village Elders.
Again?
Gia...
I know. I know you're the
magistrate and you have a lot of
work to do.
But it seems like you're always in
some meeting or --
Gia, go home. Now.
Who are you? What do you want?
Wayuman... whaaaa... yuuuu...
waaaant... what d'yuuuu... what
you want... what do you want?
What's wrong with you?
Runnnn... rung... wrong wrong
wrong... what is...
What is wrong with you?
There's nothing wrong with me.
Who are you? What is your name?
Your name? Can you understand me?
My name is Garvin.
My name is Garvin?
I thought I told you to go home.
I know...
I do not know my name.
What?
You asked... if I knew my name.
I do not.
Well... at least you seem to be
understanding a little more.
Yes. It is becoming... easier.
Ask him where he's from, Father.
Gia, go on to school. I'll deal
with the stranger.
Yes, Father.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Your eyes and skin look so...
strange. And your clothes... you
look like you've been in some kind
of accident.
I do not remember being in an
accident.
But then, I do not remember very
much at all.
What do you remember?
I walked here... from the
mountains.
The mountains? The mountains are
over two hundred seltons from
here.
I do have a clear memory of my
journey. It began on a steep path
in the mountains... near a large
waterfall with two jagged
promontories.
There are several large waterfalls
up in those mountains...
What do you remember before that?
I have no prior memories.
Do you know what that is?
No.
May I?
May I have it?
Yes.
There might be something in here
that can tell us who you are.
I wonder what these markings
mean...
"Radioactive."
What?
That is what is written on the
container.
You can read this language?
Evidently.
Radioactive... what does that
mean?
I do not know. Perhaps it is my
name.
I've never heard of a name like
that... you must come from a very
distant place.
Is that supposed to be a question?
Well, if you're asking me if I
liked what you were playing, then
the answer is yes.
And I think this is a much better
way of communicating for you.
It's much less... confusing than
when you try to speak normally.
I can always count on the ship's
Counselor to boost my self-image.
Glad to be of service.
Did you come here for something in
particular, or just for some
general Riker-bashing?
I'd actually like your opinion on
something.
I've been thinking about taking
the Bridge Officer's test and
becoming a full commander.
What brought this up?
A lot of things... working on last
month's personnel review...
talking with Beverly about her
experiences... going to my class
reunion...
Ah, the class reunion... saw a few
old friends who'd taken the
test... ?
All right, I'll admit that was a
catalyst. But I can honestly say
it's something I have thought
about off and on over the past two
years.
Why the past two years?
Do you remember when the
Enterprise hit that quantum
filament... and I was left in
command on the Bridge?
I remember...
When it happened, I felt
overwhelmed... but when it was
over...
I realized that a part of me
missed it... not the actual
disaster, but the experience of
being in command. When I was on
the Bridge, I felt like I was
exploring a new side of myself.
I don't want to give up counseling
by any means... but I would like
to... stretch myself a little.
Deanna, if you want to take the
Bridge Officer's test, you have my
complete support. But as first
officer, I'll be judging your
performance.
And I want you to know... I'm a
pretty hard judge.
I'm a pretty good student.
We'll start tomorrow -- oh eight
hundred hours.
Hmmmm. Remarkable set of teeth...
no sign of decay...
Breath smells like...
Well, it doesn't have any smell,
actually.
You can close your mouth.
Heartbeat sounds a little odd...
but seems regular.
Skin is... clammy. But you say
you feel fine?
That is correct.
No headaches... palpitations...
sluggishness... indigestion...
No. However, I cannot have
indigestion since I have not
eaten.
When was your last meal?
I do not know.
Ah. Malnutrition. You should try
to eat something that will build
strength and return your
vitality... lots of meat...
butter... cheese... that should
be a start.
What about his eyes and his skin?
They're so... odd.
Oh, quite so, quite so. I'm sure
my grandmother would have called
our friend here a... demon or
spirit or some kind of monster.
But current scientific methodology
allows us to dismiss such
ridiculous superstition and
concentrate on scientific reality.
Then what do you believe I am?
You are an ice-man.
Ice-man?
Yes. You probably come from a
race of people who live in the
snow and ice of the Vellorian
mountains. Your skin and eye
coloration are most likely a
result of prolonged exposure to
the harsh winter conditions.
Then I am not ill?
Other than your memory loss, you
don't have symptoms of any illness
that I'm familiar with. No, I'd
say you're an ice-man.
Get something to eat and have a
good night's sleep. I'll come
back tomorrow to see if your
memory has begun to return.
Thank you.
Hello, Gia.
Hello.
What did Talur say about him? Is
he sick?
Not exactly. She said he's lost
his memory, but seems to be fine
otherwise. Talur thinks he is
from a race that lives in the
mountains.
I am an ice-man.
We'll have to call you something
besides Ice-man until your memory
returns. What was the word on the
container?
Radioactive.
Mister Radioactive... ?
I don't like that name.
Let's call him Jayden.
What do you think of that?
It is acceptable. What is the
origin of that name?
It's from a story. Jayden was a
boy who looked different from
everyone else. The other children
were mean to him and made fun of
him, but Jayden never got angry.
It turned out that he was really
a handsome nobleman who had been
put under the spell of a demon and--
That can wait until later, Gia.
Right now, we should clean him up
and get him something decent to
wear. Run upstairs and get some
of my old clothes for him.
Yes, Father.
I wonder if Skoran could tell us
something about this metal of
yours...
You. Ice-man, where did you find
this?
I do not know.
I told you, he's lost his
memory... and we're calling him
Jayden for now.
Jayden, huh?
The metal is slightly warm...
All the fragments are like that.
Hmmmm.
It's obviously been tempered and
milled... but the lusterous
quality of the metal is so pure...
this wasn't made in any forge I've
ever seen.
Will you sell them?
You want them?
The metal's malleable enough to
make some jewelry.
They belong to Jayden.
Do you want to sell them? You are
going to need money.
You may be right. But I do not
wish to sell all the fragments.
They could provide a clue to my
identity.
I'll give you twenty doraks for
half the lot.
Agreed.
My leg! Get it off! Get it off!
We need a lever.
It will be all right. Don't
struggle it will only...
Jayden... put it down.
I believe the support structure of
the anvil collapsed because some
of the wood had rotted.
Did I do something wrong, Garvin?
No... just unexpected.
It's perfectly understandable.
Your people probably all have
great strength... it would allow
them to fight off the ferocious
creatures that live in the
Vellorian Mountains.
You have told me no one from the
village has ever been to the
Vellorian Mountains. How do you
know there are... ferocious
creatures there?
It is... a well-known fact.
But no one has actually seen one?
Not to my knowledge...
In the absence of empirical data
on these creatures, how can you
support your theory about the
nature of my strength?
You certainly have a lot of
questions, Jayden. I'm sure that
once your memory returns, a great
many things will become clear to
you.
Father... are you all right?
I've been... tired since this
afternoon. I'm sure it's nothing.
You feel slightly warm... some
fresh air and a brisk walk will do
you good.
That sounds like a good idea.
I'll be back soon.
You didn't like it?
I neither liked nor disliked the
food. I simply had no appetite.
Father's cooking isn't as good as
mother's. He tries, though.
Where is your mother?
She died about a year ago.
Father says that she went to a...
beautiful place where everything
is peaceful... where everyone
loves each other... and no one
ever gets sick.
Do you think there's really a
place like that?
Yes. I do.
We've just lost contact with
everything above deck twenty-one...
including the Bridge.
There is something wrong with one
of the anti-matter containment
units. The magnetic field is
starting to fluctuate.
Switch to auxiliary control.
Auxiliary control is not on-line.
We are starting to lose
containment on anti-matter storage
unit three.
All right... then switch the EM
power inverter to the lateral...
no, wait use the neodyne relay.
Commander, the neodyne relay isn't
holding. Ten seconds to
containment failure.
Computer: Emergency procedure.
Eject anti-matter storage unit
three. Authorization: Troi omega
omega three one.
Unable to comply. All power to
ejection systems has been
terminated.
Commander, the unit's beginning to--
Congratulations. You just
destroyed the Enterprise.
Thanks for the encouragement.
Don't feel bad. You passed
everything else -- diplomatic law,
first contact procedures, Bridge
operations... but, the
Engineering Qualification is one
of the toughest parts of the test.
So what did I do wrong?
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
Why not? What kind of test is
this?
It's the kind of test you'll have
to take again if you want to be a
Bridge Officer. And next time,
the problem won't be so easy, so
you better study up on emergency
procedures.
How am I supposed to study if you
won't tell me what I did wrong?
I don't know. You'll have to
figure that out too.
Fire, rock, sky, and water are the
basic elements of the universe.
They can be found in every object,
every person, every animal --
everything.
The rock in this wood can be felt
by its weight and by its hardness.
If we expose the wood to flame...
We can encourage the fire in the
wood to show itself.
We also see smoke, which is a part
of the sky. But, the water in
wood is very difficult to see.
Sometimes the basic elements can
be hidden deep within objects, but
all four elements are always
there.
Yes, Jayden?
I do not believe that is correct.
Oh?
I believe you are reasoning by
analogy -- classifying objects and
phenomena according to superficial
observation rather than by
empirical evidence.
For example, wood does not contain
fire simply because it is
combustible. Nor does it contain
rock simply because it is heavy.
Wood, like any complex organic
form, is composed of thousands of
different chemical compounds, none
of which is fire.
Jayden, that will be enough.
As I told you earlier, our friend
Jayden has lost much of his
memory. So don't put too much
faith in his... ideas.
I think that will be all for
today, class. I'll see you
tomorrow. Be sure to practice
your arithmetic and spelling
tonight.
Are you all right?
Yes. But I do not agree with
Talur's assessment. Although I do
have... gaps in my memory, I know
that fire is not an element.
That is not what you promised me!
You're getting old, Garvin. I
offered fifteen for the metal and
I've given it to you. No more.
We agreed on twenty.
Garvin is correct. You did agree
on twenty.
Stay out of this, Ice-man. Your
memory's not very reliable.
Father! Father, what's wrong?
I don't know... I feel... very
weak suddenly.
You've got a fever.
We should get him home.
What's wrong with him?
I suspect that he --
I don't know. I've never
encountered anything like this
before.
These lesions look like burn
marks.
The fluids in his body have been
overheated... that would explain
the fever and the burning skin.
Keep him cool, let plenty of fresh
air into the house...
... and give him these herbs. That
should bring his fluidic
temperature down and allow this to
pass.
I understand.
With an increased focal length and
an achromatic objective lens this
instrument will have a higher
effective magnification.
I'll be back tomorrow to check on
you.
Thank you.
Garvin, with your permission, I
would like to begin my own...
investigation regarding the cause
of your illness.
Go ahead.
Gia, I would like you to accompany
me to the village. I will need
some supplies.
What are you going to do with all
this?
I will use these materials to make
the laboratory equipment I need to
research your father's illness.
Do you think you can help him?
I do not know. First, I must
isolate the cause of the --
There he is!
It's his fault! None of us were
sick before he came to the
village!
Am I to understand that Garvin's
illness has spread?
That's right -- and you're the
cause.
That's not true!
I think we should leave, Gia.
That's it, leave! Get out of
here! Go back where you came
from!
Jayden... what are you doing?
I am studying tissue samples from
Garvin and Gia in an attempt to
isolate the cause of the illness.
Gia?
Yes. She is also beginning to
show signs of the illness.
What is that?
It is a magnifying device based on
your hand-held instrument. I have
refined the design to increase the
magnification level.
May I?
Of course.
How strong is the magnification?
Objects appear approximately five
hundred times their normal size.
As you can see, the cellular
damage is quite extensive.
However, based on the interstitial
transparency and membrane
integrity, I do not believe this
is an infection or any form of
communicable disease.
I see...
At the moment, I am looking for a
common experience or event that
Garvin, Skoran, and Gia might have
shared that could have a causal
relationship to their illness.
Well... they've all been here in
the village for many years. I'm
sure there have been many common
experiences.
Yes, but since this illness struck
all three of them in a relatively
short period of time, it is
reasonable to assume that the
experience would be recent and
unusual.
Actually Jayden... encountering
you has been the most unusual
experience that they've all shared
recently.
I am aware of that. And I am open
to the possibility that I am in
some way the causal factor. But
since you have had a great deal of
contact with me and have shown no
sign of the sickness, I tend to
discount myself as a likely
candidate.
Still... it does seem to be more
than a coincidence that shortly
after you arrived, people started
to become ill.
I agree.
Jayden... I tried to give Father
the broth... but he won't eat...
You have the fever. You should be
in bed.
I'm all right. Father needs me.
I believe Talur is correct. You
should rest. I will attend to
your father.
Gia.
When did you begin wearing that
pendant?
Two days ago. Father bought it
from Skoran. Why?
May I see it?
This was made from one of the
metal fragments I sold to
Skoran...
... the aft secondary plasma vent
has a... triple redundant by-pass...
that means the primary
access junction would be routed...
Come in.
... would be routed through the
port transducer matrix...
Here to give me more...
encouragement?
No... actually I'm here to tell
you that I've decided to cancel
the rest of your test.
What?
I'm cancelling the test.
For a moment Troi is too stunned to say anything...
then she puts down the PADD and gives him an icy look.
May I ask why?
You've taken the Engineering
Qualification three times now...
and you're no closer to passing.
Then I'll take it four times or
fourteen times or however many
times are necessary for me to get
it right.
Deanna... this is nothing
personal... but not everyone is
cut out to be a Bridge Officer.
I don't think this is for you.
Why? Because I'm not the most
technically-minded person on the
ship? I may have trouble telling
the difference between a plasma
conduit and a phase inducer, but
there's more to being a bridge
officer than just memorizing
technical manuals.
That's right, there is. But even
if you spend the next month
memorizing every technical manual
in the computer, I still don't
think you'll pass the test.
Tell me one thing... is there
really a solution? Or is this
simply a test of my ability to
handle a no-win situation?
There is a solution.
Then give me time to find it.
I can't.
As much as I care about you, my
first duty is to the ship. I
can't let anyone serve as a Bridge
Officer who isn't qualified. I'm
sorry.
"My first duty is to the ship... "
Computer, load Bridge Officer's
Test, program Engineering
Qualification Section One.
Ready.
Run program.
The control system for the primary
containment field is not
functioning.
Something's severed the ODN
conduit between here and the antimatter
storage deck.
Geordi... could you repair the ODN
conduit if you went into that
crawlway?
Sir. That crawlway is in a warp
plasma shaft. He would never
survive the radiation.
I know that. Geordi, could you
repair the conduit?
I... think so.
Then do it.
That's an order.
Aye, sir.
End program.
Something told me you wouldn't let
this go.
Congratulations. You passed.
That's what this was all about,
wasn't it? To see if I could
order someone to their death.
That's right.
I always knew that was part of
being in command... I thought I
was prepared for it... but when
the moment came, I hesitated. It
took me four times to realize that
was the answer.
Maybe you were right. Maybe I'm
not cut out for this.
You did exactly what you needed to
do. You tried every
alternative... looked at all the
options, and in the end you made
the hard choice.
Come on, let's get out of here...
Commander.
Data is hard at work in his "lab" in the dining room.
Talur is standing nearby, looking on in fascination as
Data sets up an experiment. Data is holding a cloth
SCREEN about one foot square.
I have coated this piece of cloth
with the liquid which is used in
lamps.
You can see that the cloth becomes
luminescent when exposed to an
energy source.
Where is this pattern of light
coming from?
I believe a stream of particles is
emanating from the metallic
pendant and hitting the cloth.
I don't see any... particles
coming from the pendant.
It would appear that the container
is constructed from a material
which can block or absorb the
particles coming from the metal.
It's... a trick...
No. It is empirical data. I
believe that the fragments were
originally placed in this
container to protect people from
accidental exposure.
The word "radioactive" may be a
warning about the dangerous nature
of the metal.
All right... let's say for the
moment that you're right and there
are... invisible particles coming
from this metal. What should we
do?
I will continue with my
experiments. I would like you to
gather all the pieces of metal in
the village. Put them back in
this container.
All right.
But when I return, I'll want a
more thorough explanation of all
this. I want to examine your data
in detail.
Of course.
There you are...
You're the cause of all this, Iceman.
If you are referring to the
illness, you are partially
correct, but it is more complex
than that. You see, the metal
fragments that --
What... what are you?
I do not know.
I saw it with my own eyes. He is
not a person, he is some kind
of... creature.
It's not true, Father.
We have to find him and stop him
before he kills us all.
I don't... not Jayden... he
wouldn't try to hurt... us...
Come on.
Let him rest for now.
You should rest as well. Exerting
yourself will only make you
sicker.
I'll be back.
Gia?
Jayden. Everyone's looking for
you. Skoran said that you're some
kind of creature.
I do not know what I am. But I am
not like you.
I know... you're an Ice-man. We
talked about that...
No. I am not...
Jayden... why are you wearing that
scarf?
I do not wish to scare you.
I won't be afraid. Take it off.
Please. I have to see.
I understand your reaction. I
must admit, I do not know what I
am.
But I do not wish to harm you.
You or Garvin or anyone else. I
only wish to help... to find a
cure for the illness. I was
getting very close. I need to
continue my work, but it will take
time. How long will it be until
Skoran and the others return?
I don't know... they're out
looking for you.
Then I must hurry.
Gia... I believe I have found the
answer.
You... you found a cure?
I believe so.
I tested this medicine on skin
samples from your father. They
showed improvement, so I gave him
a spoonful. He is now recovering.
What kind of medicine is it?
A compound I made which will
neutralize the particles that are
making you ill.
Swallow this.
I am sorry that I did not have
time to create a more palatable
flavor.
That's all right... it's no worse.
than... grandmother's soup.
I must administer this to everyone
in the village, but I do not think
they will trust me after what
happened with Skoran.
I could... tell them...
I am afraid they will not believe
you either.
Gia, is the well in the town
square the only source of water
for this village?
Well... ?
This is very important. Are there
any other sources of fresh water
near the village?
No... the nearest river is... two
days away...
Then I will put the compound into
the well water. It will be
diluted, but it should still have
enough potency to work.
The compound... the well...
There he is!
You see? It's just as I said...
I only wish to help you...
This is how you've helped us... by
bringing this plague...
... tried to kill us all... but you
won't succeed... I won't let you!
Excuse me. We're looking for a
friend of ours. He may have
wandered into your village a few
days ago.
You'd remember him... his
appearance would have been very...
strange. Pale skin, gold eyes...
He was your friend?
Yes. You know him?
Where is he?
I don't understand.
We didn't know his real name, so
we called him Jayden.
Are you saying... he's dead?
They killed him because they were
afraid of him.. But he saved all
of us from the sickness.
The sickness?
There were these pieces of
metal... they made everyone sick.
But Jayden put something in the
water... and now everyone's
better.
What happened to these... pieces
of metal?
We buried them out in the forest.
What was his real name?
Data.
Data.
He was my friend too.
It's Data all right... he's buried
about two meters down. He's been
deactivated... I can't tell how
bad the damage is.
We can beam him and the probe
fragments up to the ship and no
one will know.
Positronic net is on-line... sub-processor
relays in place... neuro-electrical
systems enabled.
Data... are you all right?
I do not know. I am... surprised
to find myself here. I thought I
was on Barkon Four.
What's the last thing you
remember?
I had located the crashed
Federation probe and collected the
radioactive fragments. I was
attempting to download the sensor
logs from the probe's on board
computer when there was a... power
surge. I believe the surge
overloaded my positronic matrix.
After that... I have no memory
until this moment.
But it would appear that I had...
an interesting time.
We don't know much about what
happened either... except you
apparently saved an entire village
from radiation poisoning...
And you were a very special friend
to a little girl.
If you'll excuse me, I have the
Bridge for this watch.
Counselor, have you been promoted
during my absence?
That's right.
Which means you can call me "sir"
from now on.
Yes, sir.
