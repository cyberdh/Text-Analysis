Captain's log, Stardate 46731.5.
We are in the midst of the
Volterra nebula, a stellar
"nursery." Our three week mission
is a routine analysis of several
dozen protostars in various stages
of development.
Captain, I have completed the
spectral evaluation of the outer
shell.
Our survey of this protostar is
complete.
Ensign, lay in a course to the
next one, three quarters impulse.
Riker to Captain Picard.
Yes, Number One?
May I see you in the Observation
Lounge, Sir?
Of course. I'll be right there.
My God...
Then you can identify this object,
Mister Picard.
Professor Galen.
I suppose I should say -- Captain
Picard.
Professor Galen hailed me from his
shuttle an hour ago. He suggested
that we surprise you.
To clarify... I insisted and your
First Officer was kind enough to
accommodate me. I hope I haven't
been overly presumptuous...
My star pupil now being master of
the stars...
No one is more welcome on my ship.
I never thought I would see a
Kurlan naiskos.
Fifth Dynasty?
Is that your conclusion, Mister
Picard.
Forgive me again, Captain.
Please. "Mister" will do just
fine.
The overall configuration is
certainly Fifth Dynasty. But the
surface ornamentation...
Yes...
Green polychrome over the eyes...
And the eyes themselves... open.
Third Dynasty. From the workshop
of the Master of Tarquin Hill.
Well done.
The Master of Tarquin Hill created
ceramic designs that were three
centuries ahead of his time. We
only know him by his work -- his
name has never been discovered...
This object is over twelve
thousand years old...
The planet Kurl? That's a hell of
a long way outside Federation
territory.
Indeed. I thought you had
completed your studies of Kurlan
artifacts some time ago.
I happened to be in the
neighborhood last summer. I
couldn't resist.
Go ahead.
It's complete?
The Kurl believed every individual
is a community of individuals.
Inside us are many voices, each
with its own desires, its own
style, its own way of viewing the
world.
But Kurlan civilization died out
thousands of years ago. It's rare
to find a figurine intact.
A truly incredible find.
It's yours, Jean-Luc.
How could I accept this --
... Graciously, Mister Picard. You
could accept it graciously.
How long can you stay? There's so
much to talk about.
The Professor is scheduled to meet
a Vulcan transport the day after
tomorrow.
Two days? That's not nearly
enough time...
We may have considerably more than
that.
I don't understand.
I am currently on an expedition.
A journey into unexplored
historical territory.
And I intend to take you with me.
Captain's log, supplemental. It
has been over thirty years since
I last saw my archaeology
professor. His presence has taken
me back to a time when I had
considered a very different
career...
I read your paper on the Kea Four
excavation that you delivered at
last year's symposium. It was...
informative.
Damning with faint praise.
One can hardly serve two masters.
For a Starfleet Captain at the
helm of the Federation flagship...
attendance alone would have been
impressive enough. But you still
managed to present a piece of
original research.
A small piece, granted.
Nevertheless, I admire your
tenacity.
I had hoped to see you there. You
said in your last letter that you
might go.
Much too busy, I'm afraid. I was
on the far side of the Aolian
Cluster at the time.
Professor Galen, may I ask a frank
question?
Please.
Your published writings have
been... sporadic over the last
ten years or so. Your appearances
at symposia have been rare -- or
scheduled and then cancelled at
the last minute. The finest
archaeologist of the century has
become shrouded with an air of
mystery.
And my reputation as a result has
no doubt grown.
I've yet to run across anyone that
didn't love a good mystery.
The Sataaran of Sothis Three
disdain them.
Nevertheless, as a general
principle, your statement holds.
Professor, what have you been
doing for the last decade?
Are you familiar with
micropaleontology?
Studying fossil records at a
microscopic level. I remember
reading your papers on the
subject. But that was years
ago... Then your work seemed to
stop.
No. The work continued.
I made a discovery so profound in
its implications that silence
seemed the wisest course.
This... work has occupied my every
waking thought, it's intruded upon
my dreams. It's become my life.
And when it's finished, when I
announce my findings...
It will be heard half-way across
the galaxy.
Tell me --
... I'm sorry, Mister Picard. But
that information has a price --
your agreement to join me on the
final leg of this expedition.
For how long?
Three months. Perhaps a year. If
we had a starship and complete
diplomatic access -- a matter of
weeks. But we'll have only my
shuttle, the transports we can
arrange, and our combined talents.
Why can't you do this without me?
I'm not a young man. There will
be hazards along the way. I don't
want my own inadequacies to
jeopardize the completion of this
work.
Professor, I'm honored that you'd
think of me. But I have a
responsibility --
... to History. What if you could
have helped Schliemann discover
the City of Troy? Or if you had
been with M'Tell as she stepped
upon Ya'Seem for the first time?
How could anything compare?
May I sleep on it?
Dream not of today, Mister Picard.
"Dream not of today." The night
blessing of the Yash-El.
As I recall, you missed that
question on the final exam.
I've had a few years to look it
up.
The Enterprise is yours, for as
long as you're here.
Dream not of today, Professor.
Come.
Good morning.
You look like you've been up for
awhile.
Yes.
One tea, Earl Grey, hot. One
macchiato.
Let's hear it...
I had a long talk with Professor
Galen last night. He asked me to
leave the Enterprise -- to join
him on an archaeological
expedition that could last a year.
Jean-Luc... that must be tempting.
I wouldn't leave the Enterprise.
But the offer itself has made me
feel a certain... regret.
That you could have been an
archaeologist instead of a
starship Captain?
Not exactly. I'm certainly not
sorry about the path I've taken...
But... there's a certain...
passion that comes with the
singleminded pursuit of the past.
To be captured by an image created
by another's hand, hundreds or
thousands of years ago. A being
long dead, who still speaks to you
through that image, who says "I
was alive, as you are alive."
I've only approximated that
feeling. Professor Galen made it
his life.
The Professor didn't choose this
figure at random -- the many
voices inside the one. He knows
that the past is one of the most
insistent voices inside me. This
gift was meant to remind me of
that.
And the exploration of space?
Surely that counts for
something...
I wouldn't trade it for anything.
And I'd still make the same
decision I made all those years
ago.
I'm just sorry I have to say no to
him a second time.
You two were very close, weren't
you?
I had a father. But Professor
Galen was like a father who
understood me. And he had
children -- but none followed in
his footsteps. So, I was like the
son who understood him.
I guess it was difficult for both
of you when you left.
The Professor is somewhat...
internal. He doesn't express
feelings easily. But it was
difficult for me.
In some ways, I wish he'd never
come on board.
Good morning, Mister Picard.
Professor.
The Vulcan ship can take us as far
as DS-Four. An Al-Leyan transport
is scheduled to arrive at the
station three weeks later.
They'll take us as far as Caere
and we can use the shuttle to get
to Indri Eight. Our first stop.
I'm afraid I won't be going.
The Enterprise isn't something I
can leave and then come back to.
If I go, I go for good. I'm not
prepared to do that.
This isn't some undergraduate
study project you're turning down.
This is the chance of a lifetime.
Don't make the same mistake twice.
You can't believe that my career
in Starfleet has been a mistake.
What are you doing at this very
moment? A "survey mission."
You're like a Roman centurion off
patrolling the provinces -- the
maintenance of a dull and bloated
Empire.
We both know that isn't true.
I know this. As a scholar, you're
nothing but a dilettante.
Years ago, I offered you the
chance to become the finest
archaeologist of your generation.
Your achievements could have
surpassed even my own.
But you decided to turn your back
on a life of profound discovery.
And you turned your back on me.
I never wanted --
Will you come with me?
I can't.
Then I'll be going.
You aren't scheduled to rendezvous
with the Vulcan ship for two
days...
There's nothing else for me here.
Goodbye, Captain.
Captain's Log, supplemental. We
have completed our mission in the
nebula and are en route to a
diplomatic conference on Atalia
Seven. I must admit that I have
lost my enthusiasm for those
proceedings.
At present speed, we will arrive
at the Atalia system in thirty-seven
hours.
Captain, I'm going for a walk in
the arboretum. I wouldn't mind
some company.
Captain! A distress call from
Professor Galen's shuttle.
Onscreen.
Enterprise! I'm being boarded --
Transmission has been blocked.
Locate the call's origin and set
course, warp eight.
I have located the shuttle. It is
under attack, Captain.
Take us out of warp. On screen.
A Yridian destroyer.
Battle stations.
Aye.
Professor Galen is still inside
his vessel.
His vital signs are barely
registering.
Get him out of there.
The shuttle is within a tractor
beam -- the Transporter cannot
penetrate it.
Hail the Yridians.
They are not responding.
Return phaser fire, disable their
offensive systems.
Worf?
I don't understand, Commander.
The phaser blast was not powerful
enough to destroy the ship.
The Yridian vessel was overloading
its power generators. That,
combined with the phaser blast,
caused it to explode.
Transporter Room One, lock onto
Professor Galen and transport him
directly to Sickbay...
He took a disruptor hit point
blank. There's nothing I can do.
Jean-Luc... I was... too harsh...
I'd say at least three Yridians
boarded the Professor's shuttle.
What were they after?
We're not sure, but it looked like
they were trying to download
something from his computer.
When he was attacked, Professor
Galen began to protect certain
files in his computer memory.
We were able to do a partial
(TECH)-reconstruction on the
shuttle computer, so we have at
least some of those files.
We found nineteen different blocks
of numbers like this one.
What do they mean?
They could mean almost anything.
Unless we can narrow the
parameters of the search, it would
be impossible for the computer to
identify the patterns with any
accuracy.
We tried every decryption key on
record -- in case Professor Galen
was using some kind of code.
We still can't make heads or tails
of them.
Were the Yridians able to get
these number blocks?
At least some of them. It's hard
to say how many.
Apparently, the Yridians knew more
about the Professor's work than we
do.
They may have known what these
numbers mean.
If they did, that knowledge died
with them.
Not necessarily. The Yridians are
information dealers. They could
have been delivering the number
blocks to someone else. Did they
send any signals before they were
destroyed?
We detected no transmissions.
There weren't any vessels in the
immediate area.
Do the shuttle's flight logs show
where Galen had been before coming
on board the Enterprise?
The logs indicate that Professor
Galen visited an unexplored star
system -- Ruah Four.
What's the distance from our
current position?
Four days at warp six.
The conference can wait.
Lay in a course to the Ruah
system.
Standard orbit, Ensign.
Ruah Four is an M class planet.
Sixty-seven percent of the surface
is covered with water. The landmass
contains multiple animal
species, including a genus of
proto-hominids.
Scan for any evidence of monuments
or earth works which might suggest
an ancient civilization.
There is nothing to indicate
former occupancy by even a
primitive culture, sir.
Then what was the most renowned
archaeologist in the Federation
doing here?
When he left the Enterprise, he
was going to take a Vulcan ship to
Deep Space Four. And from
there...
An Al-Leyan transport as far as
Caere... Then the shuttle to...
Indri Eight.
Mister Data, what do we know about
Indri Eight?
The Indri system was first
identified by Federation vessels
nearly sixty years ago.
The eighth planet is L-class,
covered by deciduous vegetation...
unexplored, but with no apparent
evidence of civilization, present
or past. In fact, the planet
possesses no animal life
whatsoever.
Number One, we'll proceed to Indri
Eight.
Sir, with all due respect... we've
run into one dead end... and it
doesn't sound like Indri Eight is
any more promising. We're already
late for the conference on Atalia
Seven...
I know Starfleet's timetable.
Professor Galen visited this
planet only days ago. And he was
headed to Indri Eight when he was
killed. There is a connection
between the two planets. And I'm
going to find it.
Aye, Sir.
Lay in a course, Ensign. Warp
seven.
Come.
How's it going?
It's not.
I thought if I stared at these
number blocks long enough I might
start to see some kind of pattern.
Nothing.
What I really meant was -- how's
it going with you?
As well as can be expected, given
the circumstances.
If I had only gone with him --
... You might both be dead.
Captain, you can't start thinking
like that. You didn't abandon
him. You chose not to abandon a
life-long career. It was the
right decision. And it was in no
way responsible for his death.
Yes, I realize that.
I know how much the Professor
meant to you... and how much you
want to find out what happened...
but staring at these numbers isn't
going to bring him back.
The conference on Atalia Seven has
been scheduled for six months.
Starfleet is relying on your
mediation efforts to --
Counselor, this isn't a case of my
taking the Enterprise and its crew
on some wild goose chase in order
to purge myself of guilt or
remorse.
I simply will not allow Galen's
death to be in vain. If that
means inconveniencing a group of
squabbling delegates for a few
more days, then so be it. The
responsibility is mine.
Captain.
We are in range of the planet.
Riker to Picard... we're
approaching Indri Eight.
On my way.
Sensors are picking up severe
atmospheric fluctuations on the
planet...
Assume a high orbit.
Mister Worf, onscreen.
Some kind of plasma reaction is
consuming the lower atmosphere.
Can we stop it?
No, Sir. The reaction is
global...
All life on the planet is being
destroyed.
Why would anyone want to destroy
all the life on an uninhabited,
neutral planet with no strategic
importance whatsoever?
All the life...
What if the Professor's number
blocks have something to do with
organic material?
Narrowing the search parameters to
the biological database would
increase the chances that the
computer could find a match.
I'll be in the lab.
Pattern match found.
Specify.
The number blocks are mathematical
representations of fragments of
deoxyribonucleic acid strands.
DNA fragments!
Each from a different lifeform...
from nineteen different worlds.
The planets these fragments come
from are scattered across the
quadrant. No wonder it took the
Professor years to collect them.
But why?
Wait a minute. These fragments
all have similar protein
configurations... they could be
chemically compatible.
How can that be possible? They're
different species... from
different planets. There
shouldn't be any compatibility at
all.
I know, but look at the base pair
combinations, they're uniform.
If I'm right...
Computer, connect the DNA
fragments according to protein-link
compatibility.
What is it?
I have no idea...
This is not a natural design.
Captain, this is part of an
algorithm... coded at the
molecular level.
An algorithm? Are you saying
these DNA fragments are elements
of some kind of computer program?
I know how it sounds, but there's
no way this could be a random
formation. It's definitely part
of a program.
This fragment has been part of
every DNA strand on Earth since
life began there... and the other
fragments are just as old.
Someone would've had to write this
program over four billion years
ago.
So four billion years ago, someone
scattered this genetic material
into the primordial soup of at
least nineteen different planets
across the galaxy.
The genetic information must have
been incorporated into the
earliest lifeforms on those
planets, and then passed down
through each generation.
But why would anyone do it in the
first place?
Do you have any idea what this
program could be designed to do?
We couldn't know that until we
assembled the entire program and
ran it.
There are several fragments still
missing. We've tried all the DNA
material in Federation records,
but we can't find any with
compatible protein configurations.
Then they must be from worlds
outside the Federation.
How many people aboard the
Enterprise come from non-Federation
planets?
Seventeen.
It may be a long shot, but we
ought to check each of those
seventeen people to see if any of
them have the correct protein
configurations.
I'll begin taking DNA samples.
You know Captain... I've been
thinking. Someone else must know
about this program.
I bet one of the missing fragments
was on Indri Eight... and that's
why it was destroyed --
To keep anyone else from getting
that piece of the puzzle.
It's four billion years old... a
computer program from a highly
advanced civilization... hidden in
the fabric of life itself.
Whatever information is contained
in that program could be the most
profound discovery of our time.
Or the most dangerous. And the
Professor knew that.
That's it. Thank you.
You're next, Mister Mott.
Glad to be of assistance, Doctor.
You can always count on me in a
pinch.
What do I do?
Nothing. I'm just going to sample
some of your skin cells.
Is this going to hurt?
About as much as that pedicure you
gave me last week.
That was an accident.
Relax. You won't feel a thing.
That might be it.
Of course it is.
Might be what?
Let's see if it fits into the
program.
Obviously it fits.
Fits what?
Close... but no.
Maybe you're not doing it right.
Thank you, Mister Mott. That'll
be all.
Just trying to help... no one ever
listens to me...
They all came up negative.
I've gone through every page of
the Professor's published work...
hoping I'd find a clue about where
to go next... but so far nothing.
Maybe we've been at this too long.
Why don't we both get some sleep
and start again in the morning.
"I was in the neighborhood."
When I asked the Professor what
took him all the way to Kurl, he
said he was "in the neighborhood."
Doing what?
Collecting a DNA sample,
perhaps...
The only planet near the Kurlan
system capable of supporting life
is Loren Three.
There's no Loren Three sample in
the data we downloaded from the
Professor's shuttle. If he did
get one from there it must have
been taken by the Yridians when
they attacked.
Mister Data, set course for Loren
Three, maximum warp.
Yes, Sir.
We are approaching the Loren
system.
Slow to half impulse, and take us
into orbit above the third planet.
There's a good chance our
competition has gotten here first.
Battle stations, Mister Worf.
Aye.
We are entering orbit..
You were right, Captain, we've got
company.
Cardassians.
They are hailing us.
On screen.
I am Gul Ocett. Identify
yourselves and state your business
in this star system.
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
Enterprise. And I fail to see why
I should explain my presence to
you. Cardassia has no claims on
this sector.
No, I suppose not. But my
admittedly hasty estimate shows
one Federation Starship and two
Cardassian war vessels.
Perhaps I've miscounted.
Not at all. But the Enterprise is
on a purely scientific mission.
You have nothing to gain by
interfering with us.
And you have nothing to lose by
delaying a "purely scientific
mission" for a few days. I invite
you to withdraw...
Captain, a Klingon attack cruiser
is decloaking off the starboard
bow!
They are hailing us.
This is the Klingon vessel Maht-H'a.
What are you doing here?
Captain, a Bird of Prey is
decloaking off starboard!
They are hailing us.
This is the Klingon vessel Maht-H'a.
Who are you and what are you
doing here?
Captain's log, supplemental. It
seems that we have not one, but
two competitors in our attempt to
complete Professor Galen's puzzle.
I have prevailed upon the
Cardassian and Klingon Captains to
meet with me.
I believe we all know why we're
here. If we admit that much, we
can move forward.
We are merely scouting the planet
for possible colonization --
Pah! A ridiculous story.
And why are you here, then?
Scientific research.
There's no point in trying to
deceive each other... we all know
about Professor Galen's research
and about the computer program
which is composed of DNA
fragments.
I'll take your silence as
confirmation. Now, it stands to
reason that no one has all the DNA
fragments necessary to complete
the program.
You were the first to arrive in
this system. Do you have an
organic sample from the planet
below?
Yes. And I will open fire on
anyone who attempts to obtain
another one.
As if we fear Cardassian
threats...
I believe one of you also has a
fragment from Indri Eight.
Yes. And there will be no other
samples from Indri Eight.
What is that supposed to mean?
He destroyed the planet's
biosphere after taking the sample.
Typical Klingon thinking... take
what you want and then destroy the
rest.
Thank you.
All of us are missing some of the
fragments... but not necessarily
the same ones. Unless we combine
what we have, we'll never learn
the secret of this program.
There is no secret. It is an
ancient weapon design of
incredible power. And the Klingon
Empire will not allow it to fall
into an enemy's hands.
Or even a friend's...
A weapon? The Yridian who sold us
the information claimed that the
program would yield the key to an
unlimited power source.
Until we assemble the entire
program no on can know its
ultimate purpose.
He's right. For all we know it
might be a recipe for biscuits.
Biscuits? If that is what you
believe, then go back to
Cardassia. I will send you my
mother's recipe.
Enough. Without cooperation we
will get nowhere.
What do you propose?
If you both bring the fragments
you possess to the Enterprise, I
will combine them with ours. The
result will be observed by all
parties simultaneously, giving no
one the advantage.
And if we refuse?
Then this endeavor stops dead,
right here in this room.
The screen shows the partly assembled ancient program
we've seen before. It is obvious that several "pieces"
are missing.
Captain.
Excellent.
There's still one missing piece...
Pahk! We have surrendered what we
had for nothing.
You are remarkably short-sighted,
Nu'Daq. We are closer to the
answer than we were.
And I think we're very close,
indeed.
How can that be? We have no idea
where to start looking for the
missing DNA fragment.
This is a... jigsaw puzzle...
whose pieces have been scattered
across the galaxy.
Doesn't it seem reasonable to
assume that the original designers
meant for someone to find this
puzzle -- why else would they put
the pieces in our DNA?
And doesn't that in turn suggest
that they would try to make it
easy for us to find all the
pieces? That there might be
some... pattern to their
distribution?
If that's so... our computer might
be able to find that pattern.
Doctor, program the computer to
analyze the distribution pattern
of the pieces we have, correcting
for changes in star configurations
over four billion years... and
extrapolate for the missing piece.
That'll take me a while to set
up... and a few hours more to
process.
If you wish, you may stay on board
while we wait.
I intend to.
Good evening, Commander Data.
Hello, Captain.
Is there any word yet on the
missing fragment?
The computer is processing the
data. I will be notified as soon
as there is any information.
Commander, your reputation for...
physical strength is known even in
the Klingon Empire.
You are familiar with the B'aht
Qul challenge?
I am familiar with many Klingon
rituals -- including the B'aht
Qul.
Wa'... Cha'... Wej --
Maw' tok.
My upper spinal support is a polyalloy
designed for extreme stress.
My skull is composed of cortenide
and duranium.
I understand your intellectual
prowess is equally impressive.
If I were to learn the results of
the computer search before the
others... It would give the
Klingon Empire a strategic
advantage.
A... being of your abilities would
go far in the Empire...
You are attempting to bribe me.
Not at all.
You suggested a plan that would
work to your advantage, one that
I would be capable of executing.
You then implied a reward.
Clearly --
... Commander, never mind.
What's this?
Computer, perform a level three
diagnostic on the primary
defensive systems...
La Forge to Captain Picard...
What is it, Geordi?
You might want to come down here,
sir. I found something... you
should see.
The computer has completed its
analysis.
The computer was able to
extrapolate this geometric pattern
based on the distribution of the
fragments.
The same shape as the program...
Computer, highlight the missing
section of the pattern.
The missing DNA fragment should be
in this system.
That star is in sector two-one-four-five-nine.
The Rahm-Izad system.
Direct hit on our port nacelle.
They are powering for another
volley.
Let's make it look good. Ensign,
release the inertial dampers.
They are firing...
Report, Number One.
The power boost to the structural
integrity field protected the
nacelles. We used the inertial
dampers to simulate a complete
shield failure.
It is fortunate that your Engineer
discovered Gul Ocett's attempt to
tamper with your defensive
systems.
Maht-h'a. Status.
Minor damage to starboard nacelle.
We will be operational in less
than one hour.
What? You incompetent Toh-pah.
You were supposed to be prepared.
The Cardassian vessels have set a
course for Rahm-Izad.
It's not going to take them very
long to realize that Rahm-Izad is
the wrong planet.
You're welcome to join us,
Captain.
I will... go with you.
Ensign, plot a course to the
Vilmoran System. Warp nine.
Take us out of warp.
I am scanning all seven planets in
the Vilmoran system -- none
appears to support life.
How could that be? The
Professor's data depends on --
...Correction. The second planet
shows evidence of an ancient
ocean, now dry.
It once supported life.
Yes. And it still may, in a
limited fashion not detectable by
our long range sensors.
Ensign, lay in a course, full
impulse.
Riker to Transporter Room One.
We've located a planet that may
still support life. We'll know in
a minute.
Any sign of the Cardassians?
Not yet. But I don't know how
long it'll stay that way.
Acknowledged.
I am reading a small pocket of
vegetative life -- a primitive
lichen growing in a fossilized
seabed.
Transporter Room One -- I'm
programming the coordinates.
Stand-by.
There.
Captain, we've got company. I'm
ready to pull you out of there.
Wait for my order, Number One.
You dishonorable pah-tak...
We can exchange insults some other
time, perhaps. I'm a little busy
right now...
It's been quite a chase, hasn't
it, my friends?
How... ?
We intercepted several communiques
between the Yridians and
Cardassia. My ship was watching
under cloak when Professor Galen's
shuttle was attacked.
You've been shadowing us ever
since.
And now, the reward...
Step clear, please.
I'll destroy this entire
rockface... And all traces of DNA
with it.
You'll go back to Romulus emptyhanded.
Your superiors will be
quite pleased.
The seabed... it may be only
partially fossilized... it could
still contain organic material.
Perhaps we can compromise... Let
us have the gene code. And the
Romulans and the Cardassians will
share the result.
What's to stop you from killing me
as soon as I acquiesce?
You have my word.
Etched in stone, no doubt.
No terms. There will be no deals
as long as I'm still alive.
Then I have only one recourse...
The program has activated...
I think it's reconfiguring the
tricorder... it's modifying the
emitter diode to project
something...
We die together, Brother. Tash-Koh-Tah.
You are wondering who we are; why
we have done this; how it has come
that I stand before you, the image
of a being from so long ago.
Life evolved on my planet before
all others in this part of the
galaxy. We left our world,
explored the stars, and found none
like ourselves. We were alone.
Our civilization thrived for ages.
But what is the life of one race,
compared to the vast stretches of
cosmic time? We knew that someday
we would be gone. And that
nothing of us would survive. So
we left you.
Our scientists seeded the
primordial oceans of many worlds,
where life was in its infancy.
These seed codes directed your
evolution toward a physical form
resembling ours -- this body you
see before you.
Which is, of course, shaped as
yours is shaped. For you are the
end result. The seed codes also
contained this message, which we
scattered in fragments on many
different worlds. It was our hope
that you would have to come
together in cooperation and
fellowship in order to activate
this message. And if you can see
and hear me, our hope has been
fulfilled.
You are... a monument. Not to our
greatness, but to our existence.
That was our wish. That you too
would know life, and would keep
alive our memory. There is
something of us in each of you,
and so, something of you in each
other.
Remember us...
That is all?
If she were not dead, I would kill
her.
The very notion. That Cardassians
could have anything in common with
Klingons.
It turns my stomach.
Picard to Enterprise. Away Team
is ready to beam up.
Acknowledged.
Captain's log, Stardate 46735.2.
Our frequent use of high warp over
the last few days has overextended
the propulsion systems. We are
finishing minor repairs before
returning to Federation territory.
It's a shame Professor Galen
wasn't able to see the end result
of his search...
I don't know of anyone who would
have appreciated it more.
If it hadn't been for you, Jean-Luc,
his dream to solve that
puzzle would never have been
realized. You gave him a
wonderful legacy...
It would've been a more fitting
legacy if the message had not
fallen on deaf ears.
You never know.
I have to get this day started.
Both of us.
See you this afternoon.
Riker to Captain Picard. Incoming
transmission from the Romulan
command ship.
Put it through.
Acknowledged.
Captain, my ships are leaving
orbit for Romulan space.
Until our next encounter...
Until then.
It would seem that we are not
completely dissimilar after all...
in our hopes or in our fears...
Yes.
Well, then. Perhaps one day...
One day...
