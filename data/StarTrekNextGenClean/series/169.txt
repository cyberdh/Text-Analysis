I don't want any trouble,
Barlcay...
Trouble? Why would there be
trouble?
There's always trouble when you
come in here.
You're on duty, Lieutenant.
Is that a fact?
It is, and you'll observe it.
Get back to your post.
Look, pal. Do me a favor. Take
yourself and your holier-than-thou
attitude and get out of my life.
This is insubordination, Mister
Barclay.
So punish me.
Security to Ten-Forward!
"Insubordination."
Riker, you're nothing but a pretty
mannequin dressed up in a fancy
uniform. You're full of hot air,
and if Picard has a problem with
me, he can come and tell me
himself...
I feel your confidence, your
arrogant resolve. It excites me.
Lieutenant Barclay, report to
Cargo Bay Five now.
This will have to wait, darling.
Um... Be right there.
Freeze program. Exit.
Save program.
I just don't know what to do with
him. He's always late, never
gives his best effort, always
slides by... I can't deal with
it anymore. How does a guy like
him ever make it through the
Academy...
I think it's time we talked to
the captain about Broccoli.
That's what Wesley calls him.
Keep it to yourself.
It fits.
A broken seal, Commander.
You better destroy it. Those
samples will be tainted.
Is it a problem for you to report
to duty on time, Lieutenant?
Problem? Nossir. I'm... I'm very
sorry, sir... it's just... I had
a very important communique...
it required my immediate response
and...
I don't want to hear it... we're
having intermittent problems with
the anti-grav unit, see what you
can do...
Mister Barclay, I'm tired of
seeing your name on report.
I don't know what you got away
with on your last posting, but
this is the Enterprise. We set
a different standard here.
Understood?
Understood... sir.
Captain's log, Stardate 43807.4.
We are taking on a load of special
tissue samples donated by the
Mikulaks for shipment to Nahmi
Four. The samples could prove
vital to the containment of an
outbreak of Correllium Fever on
that world.
Everything looks... it looks
normal to me...
Dammit..
I... I don't understand...
LaForge to Engineering... I'll
need more people in Cargo Bay
Five... anyone you can spare.
Out.
We could use a hand, Mister
Barclay...
I'll... I'll disassemble it later,
Commander... it shouldn't do
that... well, of course, it
shouldn't do that... I mean...
well, it shouldn't do that.
I'm not accustomed to seeing an
unsatisfactory rating for one of
my crew.
I guess the issue is whether
Mister Barclay is Enterprise
material.
I assume from your request for
his transfer that you don't think
he is, Commander...
I hate to say it... I always
thought I could work with
anyone... but I just can't stand
the guy. Broccoli makes me
nervous... he makes everyone
nervous...
Broccoli?
Young Mister Crusher started it.
I'm afraid it's caught on.
Let's get it uncaught, shall we?
By all indications, Barclay has
served honorably in Starfleet for
many years. His rating aboard
the Zhukov was satisfactory...
I recall Captain Gleason speaking
quite highly of him before his
transfer...
In retrospect, I wonder if Captain
Gleason wasn't buttering our bread
a little...
He knew we were looking for a
diagnostic engineer.
I've reviewed Barclay's
psychological profile. He's
always had seclusive tendencies...
it was noted at the Academy more
than once...
And yet he chose this way of life;
he's made the same commitment to
Starfleet that we all have...
It's easy to transfer our problem
to someone else. Too easy.
Captain, it's not like I haven't
tried...
Try harder.
He's on your team. Manage him.
Pull him in. Find ways to help
him make a positive contribution.
Get to know the man. Make him
your best friend.
With all respect, sir... my best
friend? I can barely tolerate
being in the same room with the
man...
I suggest you put your personal
discomfort with him aside,
Commander. Dismissed.
My best friend.
Hey, Reg...
Uh, how's it going?
Oh, it's... I still haven't traced
the problem, Commander...
That's okay. No rush. Take your
time.
I've... I've been planning to run
diagnostics on the graviton
invertor circuits...
Smart plan... well, I'd say we're
in good hands here...
I'll get a preliminary report to
you...
...whenever.
Before the end of the day.
Fine. And say, Reg, how about
sitting in on the mission briefing
with my senior officers in the
morning...
The briefing? Me?
I'd just like your input...
On what? I mean, should I prepare
something...
No... no... just be there. Eight
hundred hours.
I'll be on time, sir.
Good.
Morning. Start your brains, and
let's do it.
Okay, this trip to Nahmi Four is
pretty routine. We'll have plenty
of time to realign the magnetic
capacitors in both the matter and
anti-matter injectors.
Duffy, Costa, that'll be your
assignment.
We probably ought to do the flow
regulator maintenance at the same
time, Commander.
Good idea.
Ensign Crusher is putting in some
hours with us this week as part
of his training duties... he'll
be assigned to assist you, Mister
Myers. Be sure and teach him the
difference between impulse and
warp drive.
Lieutenant Barclay is working on
the mystery of the anti-grav
failure we had yesterday... your
preliminary report had a couple
of interesting theories, Reg...
Why don't you summarize your
findings so far, Reg...
Yes.
It wasn't a maintenance problem...
everything checked out. I...
I'm going to check for... a surge
in... the transfer coils.
A coil surge wouldn't have
resulted in a field dissipation.
I... I... I realize that...
But we shouldn't ignore the
possibility, Wes...
You ought to take a look at the
flow capacitor. That could
have forced a chain collapse of
the antigrav field.
I... was going to.
Good. Okay, then... let's go over
the realignment procedure...
I just didn't know what to say.
What do you wish you had said?
I should have told him to mind
his own damned business... I knew
about the flow capacitor... I
didn't need to hear about it from
a seventeen year old kid.
You're letting it get you much
too upset.
You think so?
Why are you so hard on yourself?
You don't know... it's hard out
there.
I understand, but let go of it.
You're here now.
You're right, of course.
Of course.
Let me help you relax.
I'd like that.
I knew you would.
Mmm, nice... but I'm in the mood
for someplace a little more...
unusual...
Computer. Run Barclay Program
Fifteen.
I am the Goddess of Empathy. Cast
off your inhibitions and embrace
love, truth, joy...
But I thought that's the point
of the briefing... to discuss
different approaches...
I'm not saying you did anything
wrong, Wes... it's just that
Barclay's... well, my new
project.
Yeah, Broccoli's a real project
all right...
I just gotta draw him out more...
And I shut him down.
Poor Broccoli.
Pardon me, but why is Lieutenant
Barclay being referred to
clandestinely as a vegetable?
It's a joke, Data... you know,
a nickname.
Nicknames generally denote
fondness, a diminutive shared
between friends. This does not
sound friendly.
Data's absolutely right. The
nickname stops here and now.
Captain's orders.
What the hell... ?
What happened to your glass?
Nucleo-synthesis. The structure
of the glass has been altered at
the atomic level.
A problem with the replicator?
Unlikely. A problem with the
replicator would have affected
the contents as well as the glass.
But the liquid in the glass was
a perfect replication of a dark
ale of Earth origin which I
believe is what Lieutenant Duffy
ordered.
I can't detect any residual
radiation or unusual chemical
compounds that would have caused
this.
The most probable explanation is
that the glass came into contact
with an unshielded power source.
That means a complete diagnostic
check of the Enterprise power
systems. All four thousand of
them.
Have I got the man for this job...
Hey, Reg...
Busy?
Well, I was just... no, not
really... what?
Got another mystery for you...
somehow the molecular structure
of this cup from Ten-Forward has
been altered...
Mister Barclay is the Sherlock
Holmes of the technical support
crew...
A fascinating vocation, Mister
Barclay. I am a student of
Sherlock Holmes mysteries and I
would enjoy discussing some of
your cases at your leisure.
My cases... ?
Uh, Reg, we're gonna have to run
through the power systems, to see
if there's some kind of leak that
caused this.
I had to... I was going to do it
anyway...
You were?
To... to try and explain the
anti-grav unit failure... I still
can't... nothing about it makes
sense.
Then it is possible these two very
disparate incidents could be
related.
I wouldn't bother you with
something this minor, Commander...
but it may be a symptom of a more
serious problem...
You think we'll need to put in
to a starbase?
We'll have a better idea after
Mister Barclay runs a check of
the power systems...
It was Lieutenant Barclay who
first suggested the link between
the two incidents, sir.
No, it wasn't. Not really.
Will your investigation affect
our available power during the
mission, Lieutenant?
No... nossir... we'll have to shut
off some systems... they'll be
down a few at a time... it
shouldn't... I don't think so.
Good. I look forward to your
report, Mister Broccoli.
Barclay.
If you'll excuse me.
Metathesis is one of the most
common of pronunciation errors,
sir... a reversal of vowel and
consonant, "bark" to "broc"...
Yes, I know him... comes in here,
stands at the bar, doesn't say
much... always orders a warm milk.
Figures.
Warm milk helps you sleep, La
Forge. You should try it. What's
that got to do with Barclay?
I don't know. I'm just trying
to figure the man out, that's all.
You ever talk to him?
He's not much for talking.
Does he have any friends?
Not that I've seen.
What do you do with a guy like
that?
I give him his warm milk and let
him be.
Yeah, well, I'm not so lucky.
I can't let him be. He's my
problem.
He's imaginative.
How do you know that?
I just do.
Well, then maybe he's in the wrong
line of work.
You engineering types don't
appreciate imagination... ?
That's not it, Guinan... he just
doesn't fit in here...
Terkim.
What?
Reminds me of Terkim. My
mother's brother. A kind of
family misfit. Everybody told
me to stay away from him. Bad
influence.
Did you?
Are you kidding? He was the only
member of the family with a sense
of humor. But no one ever stayed
around him long enough to realize
it... except me. My mother says
I take after him. I probably do.
Because the idea of "fitting in"
repels me, too.
Maybe I didn't make myself
clear... Barclay, he's always
late... he's nervous... nobody
wants to be around him...
If I had the feeling that nobody
wanted to be around me, I'd
probably be late and nervous too.
Guinan, that's not the point...
Are you sure?
I'll take another one of these.
Get it yourself.
Computer, where is Lieutenant
Barclay?
Reg... ?
Beverly?
Good morning, Mi-lord.
Manners, my son. Manners. You
embarrass me before our guest.
Master Barclay will spank you if
you don't behave.
I don't care.
Wesley... ?
What do you want?
Ah, well, I guess I want... Master
Barclay.
The boys got into another little
scrap, I'm afraid. But boys will
be boys.
You cannot withstand our assault
forever, Barclay.
Say you will yield and it ends
here...
I will speak with my sword, sir...
Where in God's name did you learn
to fight like this, man?
Self-taught, my good capitaine.
Shall I give you a few lessons?
Who is that? One of your allies?
Jean-Luc. Not that old trick.
I'm disappointed in you.
I'll... I'll make it easy for you,
Commander. I'll just request
reassignment...
Now, wait a minute...
Look, we both know... the whole
ship knows... I can't cut it here.
Hey, Barclay... I've spent a few
hours in the Holodeck myself, you
know.
Far as I'm concerned... what you
do in the Holodeck is your own
business... as long as it doesn't
affect your work.
You're... you're not going to tell
anyone about this?
I'm not sure everyone would
appreciate your... imagination...
like I do.
It is kind of unusual...
recreating people you already
know...
I was just kind of really...
well, it was just... I needed to
blow off some steam... because
one... one of the officers had
been on my back...
Let me guess...
Okay, it was you. And I couldn't
tell you what I wanted to, to your
face... and it just sort of...
I guess it got out of control.
I don't know... sounds like maybe
there's a side to this that's kind
of therapeutic... we ought to tell
Counselor Troi about it.
It's... it's just more
comfortable... when I'm in there.
You don't know what a struggle
it is for me, Commander.
I'd like to help if I can.
Being afraid all the time that
I'll forget somebody's name. Or
not knowing what to do with my
hands...
I mean, I'm the guy who writes
down things to remember to say
when there's a party. And when
I get there, I'll wind up alone
in a corner trying to look
comfortable examining a potted
plant.
Sometimes, I just don't want to
get out of bed in the morning.
Sometimes, neither do I.
No, but you're good. You were
born to be in Starfleet. Me...
You're just shy, Barclay.
"Just shy"... sounds like
nothing serious, doesn't it...
You can't know.
O'Brien to LaForge.
Go ahead.
I need you in Transporter Room
Three, Commander.
On my way, Chief.
I really do want you to talk to
Counselor Troi, Reg.
Troi? No, no, I couldn't.
I mean it. As your friend and
as your commanding officer.
I was synchronizing the phase
transition coils... I didn't do
anything I haven't done a hundred
times before...
The test object is made of pure
duranium.
Seems normal enough...
Watch this...
I'm glad I don't have anywhere
to go.
Chief engineer's log, Stardate
43808.2. A systems analysis of
Transporter Room Three has yielded
no suggestion of a cause for the
latest malfunction aboard the
Enterprise.
Is this part of the same pattern?
We don't know, Captain. And we
don't know why only Transporter
Room Three is affected... None
of the other Transporter Rooms
are malfunctioning...
Yet.
We have twenty-two hours before
we reach Nahmi Four. We'll need
the transporters operational by
then. I want a level one
diagnostic across the board.
(TECH)
Advise Mister Barclay to meet us
on the bridge immediately...
Ah, could we push that back, just
to fourteen hundred hours,
Commander... I've got him doing
something...
Fourteen hundred hours.
Mister O'Brien, no maintenance
on the Transporters until further
notice.
Aye, sir.
I can tell this is difficult for
you.
Is there anything I can do to make
you more comfortable?
No!
Have you ever been with a
counselor before?
Yes. No.
Which one?
Yes. But she... it wasn't real...
really a counselor.
Most people find a counselor
intimidating at first. It's okay
if you feel that way toward me.
Not... at all.
Good. Close your eyes... Lean
back.
Why?
I just want to help you relax.
You do?
Put your feet up... it's okay.
And close your eyes...
What are you going to do?
Just listen to the sound of my
voice...
Take a slow deep breath through
your nose... and let it out
through your mouth just as
slowly... good... there, that's
better, isn't it...
Oh, yes. Oh, yes, much better.
This has been... extremely
helpful...
Well, thank-you for your time.
But...
Really... very helpful... in
through the nose, out through the
mouth... I'll practice and let
you know... thank you again...
I had a very strange visit from
one of your officers today.
Barclay. Yes, I can imagine. Were you
able to do anything for him?
To be honest, I'm not exactly sure
what happened...
Where is Mister Barclay... it's
past fourteen hundred hours...
Lieutenant Barclay to the bridge.
Lieutenant Barclay report.
Computer. Locate Lieutenant
Barclay.
Lieutenant Barclay is in Holodeck
Two.
I'll get him...
No, I'll handle this. I've had
it with him.
Counselor, you better come
along...
I think you should know that
Barclay's been running some...
unique programs.
I don't care what he's been
running. My patience just ran
out.
Like I said Commander, Barclay's
been running some... unusual
programs.
This is a violation of protocol.
Crewmembers should not be
simulated in the Holodeck...
Ah, Commander... I don't think
there's any regulation...
Then there should be... computer,
discontinue program and erase...
Computer, belay that order!
Counselor...
If Barclay is having a difficult
time facing reality, to suddenly
destroy his only means of escape
would be brutal and could do
considerable damage.
They are quite disagreeable,
aren't they... shall we have a
go at them?
Delighted.
We shall thrash them.
En garde.
Stop it. Put that down.
Your sword, sir...
I don't have a sword.
How do expect to fight without
your sword?
I don't expect to fight.
Do I detect a streak of yellow
along the good fellow's back?
Perhaps we can supply a more
appropriate adversary for him.
Number One...
Number One...
Am I late? Did I miss the fight?
En garde...
Sir... you have a familiar
bearing... is it possible we have
crossed swords somewhere before?
Where is he? Where is Barclay?
Ah, a personal grudge. I warn
you... you would be wise to put
your affairs in final order before
you meet him in combat. You
challenge the greatest sword in
all the...
... in all the Holodeck.
You think this is funny?
You are very tall. It could be
very threatening to some people.
Barclay'll find out what it means
to be threatened. Computer,
discontinue image of Riker.
Sir, you have no sense of fair
play.
Just tell us where to find
Barclay.
You're gonna make us search
through this to find him?
It could provide us with valuable
information about what's troubling
him.
There's nothing wrong with a
healthy fantasy life, as long as
it doesn't take over.
You call this healthy?
You're taking it so seriously.
This is not without its element
of humor...
I am the Goddess of Empathy! Cast
off your inhibitions and embrace
love, truth, joy...
Oh my God...
Discard your facades and reveal
your true being to me.
Computer, discontinue --
Belay that order, computer!
We want to get more insight into
what's troubling the poor man.
Remember?
Quite a healthy fantasy life,
wouldn't you agree?
Report...
Sir, our velocity increased to
warp seven point two five.
Compensating, sir.
Confirmed. Velocity now warp
seven.
Maintain that. What the hell
happened?
The matter/anti-matter injectors
locked for a split second,
Captain. I am not certain why.
They seem to be working properly
now.
Picard to LaForge.
Go ahead, Captain.
Any explanation for the injector
problem?
I'm not in Engineering, sir. I'm
in Holodeck Two.
Another malfunction?
Not exactly, sir. I'll return
to Engineering immediately.
Yes, I would say you should,
Commander. Your Holodeck
activities can wait until later.
And Commander...
Yessir?
It would be wise to consult
Lieutenant Barclay on this latest
incident.
I'd like to, very much, sir. La
Forge out.
We need to find Barclay. Now.
Cast aside your masks and let me
slip into your minds...
Muzzle it.
Shhhhh!
We have a lot to talk about.
Sir, Barclay and I better get
to Engineering.
Dismissed.
I just couldn't keep my eyes
open... I'd worked twelve hours
on the power systems and then the
transporter went down and...
Reg... you had a chance to get
some help from the real Counselor
Troi... but instead you went back
in there...
I know... I didn't want to... I
just couldn't help myself...
You're gonna be able to write the
book on holodiction.
Look, I know how easy it is to
get caught up in it. I... fell
in love in there once.
Really?
But I knew when it was time to
turn it off and say goodbye...
Wasn't easy. But I did it.
You know... the people I create
in there have started to become
more real to me... than anyone
out here.
Except maybe for you, Commander.
I need you out here, Reg... right
now, more than ever.
The injectors aren't responding
to the diagnostic commands.
I... think we should drop out of
warp.
LaForge to bridge.
Go ahead, Commander.
Recommend we go to impulse power
sir.
Take us out of warp.
Controls are not responding,
Captain.
It's the injectors.
Override.
It's not a computer problem. The
mechanism is physically jammed.
I can't clear it.
Speed increasing, Captain. Warp
seven point six... seven point
six five... seven point seven...
We can't shut it down, Captain.
The anti-matter flow is
increasing. She's accelerating
out of control.
Approaching warp nine sir...
Red Alert.
Data, estimated time to
structural failure.
At this rate of acceleration,
fifteen minutes, forty seconds,
Commander...
Geordi, did you copy?
Aye, Commander...
Recommendations.
I'll let you know as soon as we
have some. LaForge out.
Okay, this ship will start tearing
itself apart in fifteen minutes...
I want every idea on the table...
I don't care how outrageous...
What about attempting a magnetic
quench on the fusion pre-burners?
No, I tried that already... the
magnetic fields won't reset.
Could the fuel inlet servos be
caught in cycle?
If they were, the swirl dampers
would be frozen too... and they
aren't...
Nothing showed up in the
diagnostic sweep... at all?
The tests... uh, showed problems...
I mean no problems with the
flow... the flow of the...
There's nothing wrong with the
computer control protocols or the
power transfer systems. As far
as we can determine, the injectors
are just physically jammed...
Injectors freeze... antigrav unit
goes down... transporter
malfunctions...
And a twisted glass...
What's the connection?
Exceeding warp nine point four.
Begin evacuation of secondary
hull. Prepare for emergency
saucer separation.
Standing by to release docking
clamps.
Re-route systems to primary hull
power sources.
Captain, the plasma flow to the
nacelles is uneven due to the
injector lock. An emergency
saucer separation could rupture
the warp field.
Twelve minutes to structural
failure.
None of the systems involved
interact directly with each
other... I don't see anything in
common...
What if... what if...
what if one of us is the
connection?
Us? How?
I don't know. But we're looking
for... a, a systemic explanation
and there isn't one. We work with
all the systems that are affected
... what if we're transmitting
something ourselves... by touching
it, or something...
The computer sensors would've
picked up anything dangerous.
But... if it were something...
something that we couldn't scan...
You might've passed it to the
injectors when you were realigning
the magnetic capacitors.
It was your glass, Duffy... and
both of you were in the cargo bay
when the anti-grav failed...
So was O'Brien.
The transporter malfunction.
That's a connection too.
Danger. Approaching safety
limits of engine containment
field.
Computer, list all physical
substances that wouldn't normally
be picked up by internal scans.
There are fifteen thousand five
hundred twenty-five known
substances that cannot be
detected by standard scans.
Great. How many of those can
exist in an oxygen atmosphere?
Five hundred thirty-two.
And could alter molecular
structure when it comes in
contact with...
... with glass.
Five.
On screen at this station.
Jakmanite has a half life of about
fifteen seconds. There wouldn't
be enough time to spread it around
the ship.
Right.
Selgninaem and Lucrovexitrin are
extremely toxic.
We'd all be dead by now. That
leaves Saltzgadum and Invidium.
Neither of which has been used
for decades.
Could either one be causing all
these malfunctions?
Most of the affected systems
weren't even invented when those
substances were in use. Who knows
what they could do to a
transporter or a magnetic
capacitor... ?
Wasn't Invidium used in...
medical containment fields?
Not for over a century.
But the Mikulaks might still be
using it.
And one of those canisters was
broken.
LaForge to bridge. We have a
working theory, Captain...
There's a chance we picked up some
Invidium from a broken canister
in the cargo bay... and have been
spreading it around the ship...
Working theories are fine, Geordi.
But we need a working solution
in about five minutes...
Understood, Commander. We're on
our way to Cargo Bay Five for
confirmation.
Nothing from the tricorder...
Danger. Exceeding safety limits
of engine containment field. At
current acceleration, structural
failure will occur in three
minutes, thirty seconds.
There it is...
Duffy and O'Brien picked up the
broken canister and became
contaminated..
If we can get it... the
invidium... down to minus two
hundred degrees Celsius, it'll
become inert.
LaForge to bridge. Invidium is
confirmed.
Recommend we flood the injector
pathway conduit with liquid
nitrogen. That should neutralize
it.
The question is, will the
injectors come back on-line?
The injectors have sustained
considerable damage, sir. I
can't guarantee we'll be able to
regain control...
We don't have much choice, do we?
Nossir.
Make it so.
Route primary coupling through
starboard transfer conduit.
Routing... ready for engine core
injection.
At current acceleration,
structural failure will occur in
forty-five seconds.
Injector conduit temperature
minus one hundred degrees
Celsius.
Transfer injector control to
manual.
Ready... temperature now minus
one hundred ninety degrees...
minus two hundred degrees, sir.
Injector status?
Matter injector... is on-line.
Anti-matter injector... still
locked.
At current acceleration,
structural failure will occur in
thirty seconds.
Cycle power through ventral
relay.
Anti-matter injector... on-line.
Reducing flow capacity.
Commencing warp engine shut-down.
Stand down from Red Alert.
Nice work, Geordi.
Mister Barclay and I thank you,
sir.
Acknowledged.
The ship is seriously
contaminated with Invidium, sir.
Recommend we set course for
Starbase one-two-one for a
complete systems and
bio-decontamination.
Understood.
Glad you were with us out here
in the real world today, Mister
Barclay.
It has been most difficult to
reach this decision to leave
you... but after thinking it
over, discussing it at length with
Counselor Troi... I think it is
for the best... I just wanted to
thank you all for your support...
You'll always be welcome here,
Barclay.
I know. That's what makes it hard
to go.
It was a pleasure to serve with
you, Mister Barclay.
Good luck, Reg.
It's been fun.
Computer, end program.
Erase all programs filed under
Reginald Barclay.
Except... Program Nine...
