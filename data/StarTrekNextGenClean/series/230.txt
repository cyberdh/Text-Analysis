I have identified the signal,
Captain. It is from the U.S.S.
Jenolan, a Federation transport
ship reported missing in this
sector seventy-five years ago.
Code one alpha zero. Ship in
distress.
Bring us out of warp, Ensign.
All stop.
Aye, sir.
Report.
We have entered a massive
gravitational field.
There are no stars or other
stellar bodies listed on our
navigational charts. However,
sensors indicate the presence of
an extremely strong gravitational
source in this vicinity.
Can you localize the source of
the gravity field?
Sensors?
I am having difficulty scanning
the object. However, it would
appear to be approximately two
hundred million kilometers in
diameter.
That's nearly the size of Earth's
orbit around the sun.
Why didn't we detect it before
now?
The object's enormous mass is
causing a great deal of
gravimetric interference. That
might have prevented our sensors
from detecting the object before
we dropped out of warp.
Mister Data, could this be a...
Dyson Sphere?
This object does fit the general
parameters of Dyson's theory.
A Dyson Sphere?
There is no comparative data,
Captain. However, this object
does fit the general parameters
of Dyson's theory.
A Dyson Sphere?
It's a very old theory, Number
One. I'm not surprised you
haven't heard of it. A twentieth
century physicist, Freeman Dyson,
postulated that an enormous hollow
sphere could be constructed around
a star. This would have the
advantage of harnessing all the
radiant energy of the star. A
population living on the interior
surface would therefore have a
virtually inexhaustible source
of power.
Are you saying there might be
people living in there?
Possibly a great number of people,
Commander. The interior surface
area of a sphere this size would
be equivalent to more than two
hundred fifty million class M
planets.
Sir. I have located the distress
signal. It is coming from a point
on the northern hemisphere.
Ensign Rager, take us into
synchronous orbit above that
position.
We are holding relative position
at thirty thousand kilometers
above the surface.
I have found the Jenolan,
Captain. It has impacted on the
surface of the sphere.
There are no life signs.
However, there are several small
power emanations... and life
support is still functioning at
minimal levels.
Bridge to Engineering. Geordi,
meet me in Transporter Room Three.
Mister Worf.
The air's pretty stale.
Life support is barely operating.
See if you can increase the oxygen
level.
Commander.
The Transporter is still
on-line... it's being fed power
from the auxiliary systems.
The rematerialization subroutine
has been disabled.
That's not all... the phase
inducers are connected to the
emitter array... the override
is completely gone... and the
pattern buffer's been locked into
a continuous diagnostic cycle.
This doesn't make any sense...
locking the unit in a diagnostic
mode just sends inert matter
through the pattern buffer. Why
would anyone want to --
There's a pattern still in the
buffer.
It's completely intact... less
than point zero zero three
percent signal degradation. How
is that possible?
I don't know... but I've never
seen a transporter system
jury-rigged like this.
Could someone... survive in a
Transporter buffer for
seventy-five years?
I know a way to find out.
Thank you, Lads.
We've got to get Franklin out of
there.
Someone else's pattern is still
in the buffer?
Aye. Matt Franklin. We went
in together.
Something's wrong... one of the
inducers has failed...
Boost the gain on the matter
stream.
Come on, Franklin... I know
you're still in there...
It's no use... his pattern's been
degraded by fifty-three percent...
he's gone.
I'm sorry.
So am I... he was a good lad...
I'm Commander William Riker from
the starship Enterprise.
The Enterprise... I shoulda known.
And I'll bet it was Jim Kirk
himself who hauled the old girl
out of mothballs to come looking
for me.
Captain Montgomery Scott. How
long have I been missing?
Well...
Sir.
I have restored life support.
The oxygen levels will return
to normal shortly.
Captain Scott... Lieutenant Worf.
Lieutenant?
Yes.
Captain Scott... perhaps there
are a few things we should talk
about.
We should probably get you to
Sickbay. Doctor Crusher will be
able to...
You've changed the resonator
array... only three phase
inverters...
Geordi, I think our guest is going
to have a lot of engineering
questions...
I'll take care of him, sir.
What have ye done to the duotronic
enhancers?
Those were replaced with isolinear
chips about forty years ago. It's
a lot more efficient now.
Uh... be careful there. That's
an EPS power tap.
Ah.
You were saying earlier that you
were on your way to the Norpin
Colony when you had a warp engine
failure...
That's right. We had an overload
in one of the plasma transfer
conduits. The Captain brought
us out of warp... we hit some
gravimetric interference and then
there it was, as big as life...
Is that a conduit interface?
Yeah. Uh, big as life... the
Dyson Sphere, right?
Aye. An actual Dyson Sphere.
Can you imagine the engineering
skills needed to even design such
a structure...
I know... it's pretty amazing.
What happened when you first
approached it?
We began a standard survey of the
surface. We were just completing
the initial orbital scan when our
aft power coils suddenly exploded.
The ship got caught in the
sphere's gravity well... and down
we went.
Franklin and I were the only ones
to survive the crash...
What made you think of using the
Transporter pattern buffer to stay
alive?
We didna have enough supplies to
wait for a rescue... so I had to
think of something.
But locking it into a diagnostic
cycle to keep the signal from
degrading... and cross connecting
the phase inducers to provide
a regenerative power source...
it's brilliant.
I'm afraid it was only fifty
percent brilliant... Ensign
Franklin deserved better.
I think you're going to like the
twenty-fourth century, Mister
Scott. We've made some pretty
incredible advances in the last
eighty years.
Aye... from what I can see you've
got a fine ship here, Mister La
Forge... a real beauty. In fact,
I must admit to being a little
overwhelmed.
Wait until you see the Holodeck.
You've had a hairline fracture
of the humerus.
It'll ache for a few days, but
it should be fine.
Thank you.
Well, I'll say this for your
Enterprise... the doctors are a
fair sight prettier.
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
Welcome aboard the Enterprise,
Captain Scott.
Thank you, sir -- and call me
Scotty.
How are you feeling?
I don't know. How am I feeling?
Other than a couple of bumps and
bruises, I'd say you feel fine
for a man of a hundred and
forty-seven.
I don't feel a day over a hundred
and twenty.
I must say I was more than a
little surprised when Commander
Riker informed me you were aboard
the Jenolan. Our records didn't
list you as one of their crew.
I wasn't actually a member of the
crew. I was just a... passenger.
I was heading for Norpin Five to
settle down and enjoy my...
retirement.
I see. Well, I would very much
enjoy the opportunity to discuss
your career at some point.
History is one of my hobbies and
I'm sure you have some fascinating
insights into the events of your
time.
I'd be happy to.
Good. I look forward to it.
Commander, we need to begin a full
spectrographic analysis of the
Dyson Sphere.
I'll get right on it, sir.
Again, welcome aboard, Captain.
I have to get back to Engineering
to start that analysis.
Engineering. I thought you'd
never ask.
Captain... The first thing
you're going to do is get some
rest. You've had quite a shock
to your system and I don't want
you to push yourself too hard.
We're pretty busy right now,
anyway, Captain Scott. But I'd
be happy to give you a tour of
Engineering a little later, when
the doctor says it's okay.
Aye.
I'll have someone show you to
your quarters.
... this is the food replicator...
and your computer terminal.
Good Lord, man... where have you
put me?
These are standard guest quarters,
sir. I can try to find something
bigger if you want.
Bigger? In my day, even an
Admiral wouldna had such quarters
on a starship. I remember a time
when we had to transport the
Dohlman of Elaas. You never heard
anyone whine and complain about
quarters like that...
The Holodecks, Ten Forward, and
the gymnasium are all at your
disposal. The computer can tell
you how to find them. Until we
issue you a combadge, just use
one of these panels if you need
anything.
You know... these quarters remind
me of a hotel room I once had on
Argelius... oh, now there was a
planet... everything a man could
want -- right at his fingertips.
'Course on my first visit, I ran
into a wee bit of trouble...
Uh, excuse me, sir... but I have
to return to duty.
Ah... well then. Thank you.
I want you to shut down the warp
engines and recalibrate the aft
sensors while I work on the
lateral array.
Aye, sir.
Can I help you, sir?
I don't think so Lass, but I'll
let you know if you can.
Sir, this area is restricted to
authorized --
I'll handle it, Bartel.
Captain Scott, this... really
isn't a good time --
We're in Engineering. Call me
Scotty.
Scotty... this really isn't a good
time for a tour. We're running
a phase seven survey of the Dyson
Sphere.
I'm not here for a tour, Lad.
I'm here to help.
That's... very kind. But I think
we can handle it...
Sensor readings indicate the
presence of a G-type star at the
center of the sphere. There also
appears to be a class-M atmosphere
clinging to the interior surface.
Is there any indication that the
sphere is inhabited?
Not as yet, sir. Our preliminary
data indicates it is still capable
of supporting life, but we have
been unable to find definite signs
of current habitation.
Send out a series of class four
probes to survey the far side of
the sphere. Perhaps we'll have
more luck with them.
Aye, sir.
Adjust the frequency
stabilization on the main
deflector dish. It's out of synch
with the aft sensors.
Laddie, ye need to phase-lock the
warp fields within three percent
or they'll become unstable.
What?
Here. The warp field is --
We use a multi-phase
auto-containment field now...
it's meant to operate above three
percent.
Ah. Well... that would make all
the difference.
We can re-start the engines in
ten minutes, Commander.
Thank you.
I remember a time when the old
Enterprise was spiralling in
toward Psi two thousand... the
Captain wanted to try a cold start
of the warp engines. I told him
that without a proper phase-lock
it would take at least thirty
minutes...
Huh? Oh, thanks.
"You canna change the laws of
physics" I said... but of course
he wouldn't listen so we had to
come up with a new engine start-up
routine...
Do you know that your dilithium
crystals are about to fracture?
We recomposite the crystals while
they're still inside the
articulation frame. I'd like
to explain everything, but the
Captain wants this
spectrographic-analysis done by
thirteen hundred hours.
Would you mind a little advice?
Starship captains are like
children. They want everything
right now and they want it their
way... the secret is to give them
what they need, not what they
want.
I told him I'd have that analysis
done in an hour.
And how long will it really take
you?
An hour.
Ye didna tell him how long it was
really going to take you?
Of course I did.
Oh... Laddie. You've got a lot
to learn if you want them to think
of you as a miracle worker.
You've got to --
Look, sir. I've tried to be
patient, I've tried to be polite.
But I've got a job to do here.
And you're... in the way.
I was driving starships while your
great grandfather was still in
diapers. I'd think you'd be
grateful for a little help.
Then I'll leave ye to work, Mister
La Forge.
... "in the way"... used to be
Engineers had a little respect
for each other... used to matter
if a man --
What do you want?
Is this a bad time?
Oh... uh, no.
Captain Montgomery Scott at your
service. What can I do for you?
Deanna Troi, ship's counselor...
and actually I'm here to see if
there's anything I can do for you.
Why... thank you, Lass. But I'm
set for now. The quarters are
more than adequate... the
replicator is a wonder...
I'm glad you're comfortable.
But I was actually more interested
in how you feel.
How I feel?
Yes. It would be perfectly normal
to feel disoriented, confused or
even frightened following the kind
of extraordinary experience you've
just had.
I suppose it's been... a little
bewildering, yes.
I'm sure you have a lot of
questions about what's happened
over the last seventy-five
years... if you'd like, I could
help you access some of our
historical records... maybe you
could discover what happened to
your family... or friends.
I'm... not ready for that just
yet. It's a hard thing to realize
that everyone ye once knew is
probably...
Pardon me for asking... but what
exactly is a... Ship's Counselor?
I'm here to take care of the
emotional well-being of our crew.
And of our guests.
And you're an officer?
Yes. They started assigning
Counselors to starships about
forty years ago when they realized
that the pressures of extended
space travel --
You're a psychologist.
Among other things.
La Forge sent you here, didn't
he? I may be old, but I'm not
crazy.
Geordi didn't send me and I know
you're not crazy.
You're damned right I'm not. And
I don't need a ship's counselor,
or a psychologist, or whatever
else you are.
I know what I need and it's not
here.
May I help you, sir?
Aye, Lad. Scotch. Neat.
Thank you.
What in blazes is this?
Didn't you order Scotch?
Lad, I was drinking scotch about
a hundred years before you were
born and I can tell you that
whatever this is, it is definitely
not scotch.
I believe I may be of some
assistance. Captain Scott is
unaware of the existence of
synthehol.
Synthehol?
Yes. It is an alcohol substitute
which is now normally served
aboard starships. It simulates
the appearance, smell, and taste
of alcohol, but the intoxicating
affects can be easily dismissed.
You're not quite... human are you?
No, sir. I am an android. My
name is Commander Data.
Synthetic scotch and synthetic
commanders...
I believe Guinan does keep a
limited supply of non-syntheholic
products. Perhaps one of them
would be to your liking.
What is it?
It is green.
Please enter program.
The android at the bar said you
could show me my old ship... so
lemme see it.
Insufficient data. Please
specify parameters.
The Enterprise. Show me the
Bridge of the Enterprise, you
chattering piece of...
There have been five Federation
ships with that name. Please
specify by registry number.
NCC-One-Seven-Oh-One. No bloody
A, B, C, or, D.
Program complete. Enter when
ready.
Here's to you, Lads...
I hope I'm not interrupting, but
I was just coming off duty and
wanted to see how you were doing.
Not at all, not at all. Have a
drink with me, Captain.
I'm not sure what it is, exactly,
but I'd be careful if I were you.
It has a real...
Aldeberan whiskey.
Who do you think gave it to
Guinan?
Constitution class...
Aye. You're familiar with it?
There's one at the fleet museum.
This is your Enterprise?
One of them... I actually served
on two. This was the first...
she was also the first ship I ever
served on as Chief Engineer.
You know, I served aboard eleven
ships in my career... freighters,
cruisers, starships,... but this
is the only one I ever think
about... the only one I miss.
The first ship I ever served
aboard as Captain was called the
Stargazer... it was an overworked,
underpowered vessel that was
always on the verge of flying
apart at the seams. In every
measurable way, my Enterprise is
a superior ship.
And yet... there are times I miss
that cramped little Bridge very
much.
It's like the first time you fall
in love... you don't ever love
a woman quite the way you did that
first one.
To the Enterprise and the
Stargazer... old girlfriends we'll
never see again.
What do you think of the
Enterprise-D?
She's a beauty... with a good
crew...
But... ?
When I was here, I could tell you
the speed we were traveling by
the feel of the deckplates. On
your ship... I'm in the way.
Seventy-five years is a long time.
If you'd like to study some of
the technical --
I'm not eighteen. I can't start
over again like a raw cadet.
There comes a time when a man
finds that he can't fall in love
again... when he knows that it's
time to stop.
I don't belong on your ship...
I belong on this one. This was
my home. This is where I had a
purpose. But this isn't real...
it's just a computer-generated
fantasy. And I'm just an old man
trying to hide in it.
Computer, shut this bloody thing
off. It's time I acted my age.
Come.
Mister La Forge, I understand that
the Jenolen conducted an extensive
survey of the Dyson sphere before
it crashed. Have we been able
to access those records?
We tried to download their memory
core, but it was pretty heavily
damaged in the crash. We haven't
been able to get much out of it.
Perhaps Captain Scott could be
of use in accessing that material.
It's possible. He would know
those systems better than any of
us. I'll have Lieutenant Bartel
beam down with him.
Commander. I'd like you to
accompany Mister Scott.
Me, sir?
This is not an order, Geordi, it
is a request... one which you are
free to decline.
One of the most important things
in a man's life is the need to
feel useful. Mister Scott is a
Starfleet officer... I would like
him to feel useful again.
I'll go with him, Captain.
Thank you.
Commander, I believe I have found
something on the sphere which
could be a communications device.
There is an antenna array
approximately four hundred
thousand kilometers south of our
present position. It is emitting
low-intensity subspace signals.
Can we open a channel?
Not from our present orbit,
Commander. The array is currently
directed away from us.
Prepare to take us to an orbit
above those coordinates.
Captain Picard to the Bridge,
please.
Are you feeling all right?
Never get drunk unless you're
willing to pay for it the next
day. I'll manage.
Okay.
Energize.
Sensors indicate that the large
circle is a portal or airlock,
possibly leading to the interior
of the sphere.
You said you found a
communications array?
Yes, sir. It is located on the
periphery of the hatch.
This looks like the front door...
should we ring the bell?
Mister Worf, open a channel to
that array.
Aye, sir.
Captain! I'm reading intense
graviton emissions on the surface
of --
Some type of tractor beam has
locked onto us.
Helm, get us out of here!
We've lost main power... auxiliary
power down to twenty percent.
We are being pulled inside.
Auxiliary power failing.
The resonance frequency of the
tractor beams is incompatible with
our power systems. Warp and
impulse engine relays have been
overloaded. I am attempting to
compensate.
The tractor beams have released
us, sir.
Hold position here until we can
get our bearings.
Full sensor sweep, Mister Data.
Where are we?
We are approximately ninety
million kilometers from the star's
photosphere.
I am reading a great deal of
surface instability. It may
be--
Sir. The inertial motion from
the tractor beams is still carrying
us forward. The impulse engines
are off-line and I can't stop
our momentum. We're falling
directly into the star.
The primary computer database
should be on-line now. Give it
a try.
Okay... I've got three access
lines to the central core...
still nothing.
Bunch of old useless, garbage...
What?
I said it's old, Mister La Forge.
It can't handle the interface of
your power converter.
This equipment was designed for
a different era... now it's just
a lot of junk.
I don't know... looks like some
of it has held together pretty
well.
It's a century out of date. It's
just...
Obsolete.
That's interesting... because I
was just thinking that a lot of
these systems haven't changed much
in seventy-five years.
This Transporter is almost
identical to the ones we use on
the Enterprise.
The subspace radio and sensors
operate on the same basic
principles, and impulse engine
design hasn't changed much in two
hundred years. If it weren't for
the structural damage, this ship
could still be in service today.
Maybe so... but when they can
build a ship like your Enterprise,
who'd want to pilot an old bucket
like this?
I don't know... if this ship were
operational I bet it would
run circles around the Enterprise
at impulse speeds.
Just because something's old
doesn't mean you throw it away.
We used to have something called
a dynamic mode converter... you
wouldna have something like that
on your Enterprise would ye?
I haven't seen one of those in
a long time... but I might have
something similar.
La Forge to Enterprise.
La Forge to Enterprise, come in
please.
Interference?
No...
They're gone.
We will enter the sun's
photosphere in three minutes.
Maneuvering thrusters?
I've got thirty percent power...
it won't be enough to stop us.
No. But it may be enough to turn
us into orbit and hold our
distance from the photosphere.
Port thrusters ahead full,
starboard back full.
Our flight path is changing...
right ten point seven degrees...
insufficient to clear the
photosphere.
Lieutenant Bartel, divert all
power from auxiliary relay systems
to the maneuvering thrusters.
Our angular deflection is
increasing. Now at fifteen
degrees... eighteen... turn
now twenty point one degrees.
We're in orbit, Captain. Our
altitude is one hundred fifty
thousand kilometers.
I'll see about getting main power
back on-line.
Very well.
Mister Data, begin a scan of the
interior surface for life forms.
I want to know who brought us in
here and why.
Aye, sir.
I can't find them anywhere in
orbit.
They could've crashed into the
sphere like the Jenolen.
No, we'd be picking up background
radiation if they'd gone down.
There's another possibility...
they could be inside the sphere.
Maybe.
Whatever's happened, we've got
to find them. If we can get these
engines back on-line, we could
track them by their impulse ion
trail.
Are ye daft? The main drive
assembly's shot, the inducers
are melted, and the power
couplings are wrecked... we'd
need a week just to get started.
But we don't have a week, so
there's no sense crying about it.
Come on, let's see what we can
do with your power converter.
The sphere appears to be
abandoned.
Our sensors show that the star
is extremely unstable. It is
experiencing severe bursts of
radiation and matter expulsions.
That would explain why they
abandoned it.
But if there's no one still
living here, how were we brought
inside?
I believe we triggered a series
of automatic piloting beams which
were designed to guide ships into
the sphere.
Sir. Sensors show a large
magnetic disturbance on the
star's surface.
It is a solar flare, Captain.
Magnitude: twelve. Class: B.
Shields?
Shields are up... but only at
twenty-three percent.
The star has entered a period of
increased activity. Our sensors
indicate that solar flares will
continue to grow. In three hours,
our shields will no longer be
be sufficient to protect us.
Shunt the deuterium from the main
cryo pump to the auxiliary tank.
The tank can't handle that much
pressure.
Where'd you get that idea?
It's in the impulse engine
specifications.
Regulation forty-two slash
fifteen... "Pressure Variances
in IRC Tank Storage"?
Right.
Forget it. I wrote it.
A good engineer is always a wee
bit conservative... at least on
paper. Just by-pass the secondary
cut-off valve and boost the
flow... it'll work.
Well, if we've done our jobs
properly, the engines should be
coming back on line... about...
now.
You were right... the auxiliary
tank is holding.
The Bridge is yours, Commander.
Hey, you're the senior officer
here.
I may be a captain by rank, but...
I've never wanted to be anything
else but an engineer. Take the
Conn, Geordi.
All right.
Shields still holding... but down
another fifteen percent.
Riker to Captain.
Go ahead Number One.
We've restored helm control...
and you have partial impulse
power.
Good. Stand-by.
Can we use the phasers to open
a hole in the sphere?
No, sir. The exterior shell is
composed of carbon-neutronium.
Our weapons would be ineffective.
Mister Data, we need to find a
way out of here. Begin scanning
for another hatch or portal that
might still be open.
The interior surface area is over
ten to the sixteenth square
kilometers. It will take seven
hours to completely scan the
surface.
I will endeavor to speed up the
process.
The Enterprise ion trail leads
right to this point.
It looks like some kind of doorway.
I'll bet you two bottles of scotch
that they're inside the sphere...
and that they went in right
through that hatch.
No bet here. The question is,
how?
Look at the momentum distribution
of the ions... it would take an
impulse engine at full reverse
to put out a signature like that.
So they didn't go in willingly.
This looks like some kind of
communications array.
Aye. We found hundreds of them
when we did our initial survey
seventy-five years ago.
Did you try hailing them?
Sure. That was standard
procedure in my day. We did it
right before we crashed.
Hailing is standard procedure
today, too...
Scotty, what if these aren't
communications arrays... what
if they're access terminals...
which are triggered by subspace
signals on certain frequencies...
Frequencies like our standard
ship's hail.
Exactly. When the Enterprise
saw this terminal they probably
did the same thing you did
seventy-five years ago -- opened
a channel. Only this time it
triggered something which
activated that hatch and pulled
the ship inside the sphere.
A nice bit of reasoning, Lad...
very nice indeed.
We could trigger the hatch, but
we'd probably be pulled in like
they were.
Maybe all we need to do is get
our foot in the door.
If we trigger the hatch with a
subspace transmission, we might
not be pulled inside if we keep
our distance from the sphere --
say a half million kilometers.
Then, when the hatch starts to
close again, we move in, and use
the Jenolen to jam the hatch open
and hope the Enterprise can
escape.
You can't be serious. That hatch
is huge. It could crush this ship
like an egg.
The shields will hold Lad, don't
you worry about that. I know how
to get a few extra gigawatts out
of these babies.
Scotty. This is crazy. I am not
going to let you---
Geordi. I've spent my whole life
figuring out how to make crazy
things work.
I'm telling you... one engineer
to another... I can do this.
All right. Let's do it.
We're at five hundred thousand
kilometers.
Engines're ready.
Okay. Here we go.
Come on... there's nothing out
here... give it up.
I still can't open a channel to
the Enterprise... there's too much
interference. We'll have to to
wait until we're right in the
doorway.
That's it. Let's go! Full
impulse.
Sir. There is an audio message
from Commander La Forge.
This is La Forge, do you read me,
Enterprise?
We read you, go ahead Commander.
Understood.
Set a course.
The plasma intercooler's gone.
The engines are overheating.
I've lost helm control...
La Forge to Enterprise. Captain,
we won't be able to move this ship
out of the way when you get
here... you're going to have to
destroy it in order to escape.
How long will it take us to reach
them?
With impulse engines operating
at sixty percent power, it will
take one minute forty seconds.
I can't hold her together much
longer... we've got about two
minutes before the engines go
critical.
Bridge to Transporter Room Three.
Stand by to beam two from the
Jenolen as soon as we're in range.
Photon torpedoes loaded.
It's coming apart, Lad. I can't
do anything else.
We are within transporter range.
Bridge to Transporter Room.
Energize.
Fire torpedoes.
There now. That wasn't so bad,
was it?
So, this alien space 'baby'--
which was about the size of a
four-story building -- really
thought the Enterprise was its
mother.
You're pulling an old man's leg.
No, really. It was 'suckling'
power directly from the ship's
fusion reactors... so Doctor
Brahms and I changed the power
frequency from twenty-one
centimeters to point-oh-two
centimeters...
You soured the milk.
That's right.
Enjoy these times, Geordi. You're
the chief engineer of a
starship... it's a time of your
life that'll never come again...
and once it's gone... it's gone.
I thought you were going to buy
me a drink in Ten Forward.
I have a better idea.
You're giving me one of your
shuttles?
Call it... an extended loan.
Since you lost your ship while
saving ours, it seemed only fair.
It's not much to look at...
Lad, every woman has her own
charms... ye just have to know
where to look.
It's a little slow, but it'll get
you to the Norpin colony... if
that's really where you want to
go.
The Norpin Colony is where old
men go to retire... maybe I'll
end up there someday... but not
just yet.
Bon voyage, Mister Scott.
Thank you, sir. For everything.
They're a good crew.
Yeah.
And she's a fine ship... a credit
to her name.
But I've always found that a ship
is only as good as the Engineer
who takes care of her... and from
what I can see... the Enterprise
is in good hands.
