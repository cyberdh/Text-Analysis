Get the stasis units in here and
bring them on-line.
Tell Doctor Selar to use ward
three for the ambulatory cases,
I'll take the --
Transporter Room Four to Sickbay.
They're coming in now.
Acknowledged.
Back everyone.
What happened?
The Lenarians attacked us outside
the conference room.
He's in cardiac arrest.
Get the pulmonary support unit.
Internal hemorrhaging... the bioregulator
in his artificial
heart's been fused... damage to
the spleen and liver... what kind
of weapon did this?
A compressed teryon beam.
Forty cc's inoprovaline...
Activity in the isocortex is
falling. Cortical stimulator.
Now.
Again.
Welcome to the afterlife, Jean-Luc.
You're dead.
What's going on, Q?
I told you. You're dead. This is
the afterlife. And I'm God.
You are not God.
Blasphemy! You're lucky I don't
cast you out, or smite you or
something.
I don't know what game it is
you're playing, but I am not going
to participate.
What an ego.
Did you think the great Jean-Luc
Picard would never die?
Q, whatever you've done to --
I haven't done anything.
Check your heart rate. Go ahead.
No pulse? What a surprise.
How do I know this isn't another
one of your tricks?
Think, Jean-Luc. Why would I go
to all the trouble of faking your
death when I could simply kill you
whenever I felt like it?
Is that what happened?
I wouldn't want to steal the
credit... it was a rather
disgruntled Lenarian actually.
The conference...
Yes, yes. The conference, the
unexpected attack, the compressed
teryon beam... the bottom line is,
your life ended about five minutes
ago under the inept ministrations
of Doctor Beverly Crusher.
No. I am not dead. I refuse to
believe there is an afterlife
which is run by you.
The universe is not that badly
designed.
Very well. If you really require
more evidence of your post-mortem
status, I'll just have to provide
some...
Jean-Luc...
Father...
I told you not to go running off
to that Academy. I told you that
Starfleet would bring you to a bad
end. But you wouldn't listen.
Now look at you... dead before
your time.
All right, Q... enough.
Enough what?
Why couldn't you listen? Didn't
you understand that I was only
looking out for your best
interests?
Q, stop this.
Even now, after all these years...
you still manage to disappoint me,
Jean-Luc.
I hope you're enjoying this, Q.
This isn't for me. This is for
you, Jean-Luc... I wanted to give
you an opportunity to make peace
with your sordid past.
I find it hard to believe that
you're doing this for the benefit
of my soul.
Now that you've finally shuffled
off the mortal coil, we're free to
spend some time together. I
simply want you to be at peace
with yourself.
"Some time together?"... how much
time?
Eternity.
So I'm in hell.
That's the spirit, Jean-Luc.
Don't let a little thing like
death slow down that rapier wit.
Now you're sure you don't have any
regrets or feelings of guilt about
your former life? I can't have
you whining and complaining
through eternity.
If I'm truly dead, then my only
regret is dying... and finding you
here.
You wound me, Mon Capitain. After
all, I wasn't the cause of your
death...
... this was.
Is that...
Your artificial heart.
You might have lived if you'd had
a real heart instead of this
unreliable piece of technology.
How did you manage to lose yours
anyway?
It was a... mistake.
Something you regret?
I regret a great many things from
those days...
Really?
It wasn't very smart of you to
take on three Nausicaans like
that.
No, it wasn't.
And did I hear you laugh? It's so
unlike you to have a sense of
humor... especially about getting
stabbed through the back.
I was... a different person in
those days... an arrogant,
undisciplined, young man with far
too much ego and far too little
wisdom.
I was more like you.
I'm sure you were far more
interesting in those days. A pity
you had to change.
The only pity is that I had to be
impaled through the back before I
learned my lesson.
I started that fight with the
Nausicaans... I started it
because I was young and cocky...
If I had been more responsible at
that age... I wouldn't have needed
this heart... and I wouldn't have
died from a random energy surge
thirty years later.
So if you had it to do all over
again... ?
Things would be different...
Bravo! Bravo!
Nicely done.
Cortan? Cortan Zweller?
Of course it's me... boy, she
must've hit you pretty hard.
You're slowing down, Johnny. You
should've seen that one coming.
Marta...
Are you okay?
I'm... just a little
disoriented...
Oh, please. Now he's just playing
for sympathy.
I want to get something to eat and
head over to the casino at
Bonestell. Who's coming?
I'll... catch up with you later.
Are you sure you're all right?
No, no. I'm fine Marta -- Marty,
really.
Come on, Marty. I bet he has
another date anyway.
That's it, isn't it?
You are incorrigible.
Try not to end up in the hospital.
Attention on deck, Ensign Picard!
Q...
That's Captain Q to you, young
man.
What's the point of creating
this... fantasy?
It's no fantasy. This is all very
real, I assure you. You're twenty-one
years old again... a brash
young man, fresh out of the
Academy.
I don't look it.
To everyone else, you do.
I thought you said I was dead...
now you tell me I'm alive?
You mortals can be so obtuse. Why
do you persist in believing that
life and death are such static and
rigid concepts.
I can take your life and then give
it back to you with the snap of a
finger.
Let's say for the moment that it's
true... what purpose does it serve
to bring me here?
You said you regretted a great
many things from this time in your
life. Well, now you have a chance
to change some of them.
Change. You mean change the past.
Q, even if you have brought me
back in time somehow... surely you
must realize that any alteration
in this timeline could have a
profound impact on the future --
Spare me your egotistical musings
on your pivotal role in history.
Nothing you do here will cause the
Federation to collapse or the
galaxy to explode. To be blunt...
you're not that important.
I won't do it. I won't alter
history.
Oh, very well... if you attach so
much importance to the continuity
of time... I can personally
guarantee that nothing you do here
will end up hurting anyone, or
have an adverse affect on what you
know as history. The only thing
at stake here is your life and
your peace of mind.
You have my word.
It's bad form to laugh at one's
god. Whether you believe me or
not, you're here and you have a
second chance... what you do with
it is entirely up to you.
Do you know where you are?
Starbase Earhart... we came here
just after graduation... to wait
for our first deep space
assignments.
That's right. It's two days
before your unfortunate encounter
with a Nausicaan sword... you have
that long to make whatever changes
you wish. If you can avoid
getting stabbed through the heart
this time -- which I doubt -- I'll
take you back to what you think of
as the present and you can go on
with your life... with a real
heart.
So then I won't die?
Of course you'll die. It'll just
be at a later time.
What if I don't avoid the fight...
what if I don't make any changes?
Then you die on the table and we
spend eternity together.
Wonderful.
I'm glad you think so.
I am curious about one thing...
Johnny, why did that rather
attractive woman slap you just
now? Something you said?
Picard thinks back, trying to remember.
That woman's name was... Corlina.
I was supposed to take her to
dinner... on this night...
But then she found out that...
I'd made a second date with
another woman... named Penny.
Corlina was... somewhat upset.
I'm impressed. I had no idea you
could be such a cad.
Computer, what time is it?
Sixteen eleven hours.
In fact, Penny should be...
waiting for me... right now.
You're awfully quiet today. What
happened to the dashing young
Ensign from last night... the one
with the winning smile and the
smooth talk about my eyes?
Nothing. I'm just a little
more... contemplative.
And what are you contemplating?
Penny, perhaps we could just...
talk for a while. I don't know
anything about you... where you
come from... what your interests
are... your last name...
I come from Rigel, my last name is
Muroc and I like men in uniform.
I think that's enough talk.
Penny... I don't think it would be
fair... to you to pretend that I'm
really interested in a...
relationship right now...
Who said anything about a
relationship?
What's wrong... Don't I look as
attractive as I did last night?
What? No, not at all. You're a
very... handsome woman.
Handsome... that's something you
say to old ladies.
Penny. To me you are definitely
not an old lady.
I wasn't after your pity.
Penny for your thoughts?
You never told me you were such a
lady's man.
I was a puerile adolescent who let
himself be ruled by his hormones
instead of his head.
It seems your friends know how to
have a good time. Maybe you
should go take some lessons.
Hey, you! Get over here with
those drinks before I tear your
head off!
Excuse me.
Are you addressing me... ?
He's winning.
Of course.
I thought you had a date.
She... decided to leave.
You're getting old, Johnny.
Thank you... thank you all...
Very nice... forget about
Starfleet and just play Dom-Jot
for a living.
This is nothing... it's just a
little trigonometry, and some
minor wrist action. Barokie --
now there's a game.
Human!
Play Dom-Jot... Human?
I think I could be persuaded to
play one more game.
No, don't play him.
Why?
It'll cause trouble.
He's a Nausicaan... they can be
very ill-tempered when they lose.
So can I.
Corey, listen to me. This is a
bad idea. Don't play him.
What's gotten into you?
Let's go.
I see you've found your Nausicaan
friend.
You seem un-impaled so far.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Ensign Zweller seems to be doing
well.
He's going to lose. The Nausicaan
is cheating.
Really? I'm beginning to like
these Nausicaans.
If history repeats itself, Corey
will figure it out later tonight
and then he'll want revenge.
And will you help your best friend
avenge this injustice?
I did the first time. I found a
way to rig the table so that Corey
could win in a rematch.
You? Cheated? Picard, I'm
impressed.
It was a foolish mistake. The
Nausicaan and his two friends
didn't take the loss very well.
They were outraged... they wanted
a fight...
And I gave them one.
A beautiful story...
Gets you right here doesn't it?
Dom-Jot!
Human play Dom-Jot!
I've played a lot of Dom-Jot, in
a lot of places, and I've never
seen the balls roll that well for
anyone. Did you see the way he
rolled the terik into straight
nines? That's a one in a million
shot and he did it twice.
So he was cheating...
It may have simply been
extraordinary luck.
I was watching the way he held the
cue. Every time he needed to make
a tough shot, he held the cue
close to his waist. I think he
had some kind of magnetic device
in his belt. It must've been
controlling the balls.
That's terrible.
We have to get even.
What do you have in mind?
We could do the same thing to him
that he did to us. Cheat. We'll
rig the table so his device will
backfire on him.
That won't solve anything.
It'll teach him that he can't go
around cheating Starfleet
Officers.
What it will do is provoke him.
And provoking a Nausicaan is not
a good idea.
I can handle him.
What if he's not alone... what if
he brings some friends along next
time?
Well... then I guess I'll have to
depend on my friends to help me
out.
Corey... there must be a better
way to handle this...
When did you start backing away
from a good fight?
We're not cadets anymore... we're
officers. We have to start...
setting a higher standard for
ourselves.
Maybe he's right... maybe this
isn't such a good idea.
Look, we've only got one more day
before we all have to report to
our ships. Let's have one last
adventure together... we may not
see each other again for a long
time.
No. I'm sorry Corey, but I won't
do it.
It was a good idea, Corey... but
let's just forget about it...
He'll get over it.
I hope so.
What?
Nothing... it's just that usually
you'd be the one plotting revenge.
That would be more in character,
wouldn't it?
Much.
But I always suspected you had a
hidden streak of responsibility
somewhere.
Maybe I'm just getting... a little
older.
Maybe these bars are starting to
feel a little heavy, Ensign.
Ensign Picard and Ensign
Batanides... sounds weird,
doesn't it?
It's going to take some getting
used to.
It's too bad we can't get used to
it together.
The -- the three of us, I mean.
Of course.
Come.
Is there a John-Luck Pickard here?
From one of your conquests, no
doubt. I guess some things aren't
going to change.
Did I interrupt something sordid
I hope?
No, you did not.
Pity. She's quite attractive.
We were friends, nothing more.
Is that another regret I hear?
My, my... we're simply riddled
with regrets about our youth,
aren't we?
My friendship with Marta is not
something I regret.
But you do wish you'd been more
than just... friends, don't you?
Well... here's your chance to
change all that.
What do you want, Q?
I thought you might like to know
that Mister Zweller has decided to
ignore your advice.
He's in the Bonestell Facility
right now... rigging the table to
beat the Nausicaan. I guess you
weren't that persuasive.
Corey...
Ow!
Johnny... don't sneak up on me
like that. I thought you were the
gambling foreman.
Sorry.
It's all right. I'm glad you're
here.
Hand me the magna-spanner.
I'm not here to help you, I'm here
to stop you from making a serious
mistake.
You sound like my mother.
Cheating the Nausicaan could have
serious consequences for all of
us. It's a risk we can't afford
to take.
You are my mother.
Well, Mom... gee, I guess I'll
have to go tell the Nausicaans I
don't mind if they cheat me --
This isn't a joke, Corey.
It better be.
Now, I'm going to finish my work
here. If you want to help me --
fine. If you don't, then I'll see
you back at the Starbase.
I said you're not doing this.
Are you going to hit me, Johnny?
No.
But I will tell the gambling
foreman that someone's been
tampering with his Dom-Jot table.
All right, have it your way...
... Ensign Picard.
I just couldn't make him
understand.
At least he did finally give it
up...
Yes, but... he didn't take it very
well.
Oh, you know Corey... he'll forget
all about it by tomorrow.
I hope so. We were friends for
many years after this.
Or at least... I hope we will be.
You keep smiling at me.
I've just never seen you like this
before. You're so... serious.
Do I really seem that different?
I don't know... maybe I'm just not
used to seeing you in an officer's
uniform...
No... it's more than that... you
do seem different...
I mean, I'm not complaining... I
think it suits you.
Really?
Yes. I think it's very...
... attractive.
Johnny... have you ever thought
about us... getting together?
Actually... I have. For a long
time.
Why didn't you ever say so?
I... don't know.
At the moment... I can't imagine
why I didn't...
Well... you've said it now.
Good morning, darling.
A little jumpy this morning, are
we? Feeling guilty perhaps?
I don't have anything to feel
guilty about, Q.
No?
"We were friends, Q. Nothing
more."
You're the one who gave me the
opportunity to change things...
So what happens next?
I don't know. But I do know that
things will be different.
I'm sure.
Morning.
Johnny.
What's wrong?
Well... this is the morning after,
huh?
I suppose so.
I... don't quite know where to
begin...
Marta... I don't regret what
happened last night... and I hope
you don't, either.
I don't know... we've been friends
for a long time... and now...
I hope last night has only brought
us closer.
Do you remember the first day we
reported to the Academy?
Very well.
They marched us into Scobee Hall
in our stiff new uniforms... and
then Admiral Silona gave us the
old welcome aboard speech.
He said, I want you all to look to
the left of you and then look to
the right of you...
... One of you isn't going to make
it through the next four years.
I remember thinking... that's me.
I'm not going to make it. Then I
looked to my right... and there
you were with this cocky look on
your face... and you said, "we'll
see about that." From that
moment, I knew I wanted you as a
friend.
And now... I'm afraid we've ruined
that friendship.
Perhaps we should just... pretend
that this never happened and try
to...
I wish I could. It would make it
easier to say good-bye tomorrow.
We're all supposed to get together
later... the last big night on the
town before we ship out... now I'm
not sure it's such a good idea...
I don't want you to do anything
that'll be uncomfortable...
I'll be there. We planned this...
I don't want to disappoint Corey.
Let's see... in the past twenty-four
hours, you've managed to get
slapped by one woman, have a drink
thrown in your face by another,
and alienate your two best
friends. I'd say you're doing
quite nicely so far.
Just one more thing to do... avoid
getting stabbed through the heart
tonight.
I think you'll like serving aboard
the Ajax... I understand Captain
Narth is an excellent officer.
So I hear.
Well... here's to the class of
'twenty-seven.
Play Dom-Jot, Human? Give you a
better chance.
Give you a bigger stick maybe.
I don't think we're interested.
They are Undari.
Cowards.
What did you say?
Coward. Like all Starfleet. You
talk and you talk... but you have
no guramba.
Why don't we find out --
Don't be a fool.
There are plenty of other people
to play Dom-Jot. Go on about your
business.
Maybe I play with you... give you
a good time.
Orcho lok resnik Starfleet...
You've done enough.
Corey, I'm sorry. He was drawing
a weapon...
I don't know who you are
anymore... but you're not my
friend.
Good-bye, Johnny.
Congratulations, Mon Capitain.
You did it.
Can I help you?
Can I help you, Mister Picard?
Worf...
This is not for me. You should
take it to Commander La Forge in
Engineering.
What's happened... ?
Is something wrong?
I'm not sure...
Mister Worf, what's my rank and
position?
You are a Lieutenant junior
grade... the assistant
astrophysics officer.
Are you feeling all right?
Who's the Captain of this ship?
Captain Thomas Halloway.
Perhaps I should escort you to
Sickbay.
No. I think I can find my way.
Thank you, Commander.
Beverly, something's happened to
me. I'm not sure --
Vhat seems to be de trouble,
Lieutenant Picard?
Q, what have you done?
I've done exactly what I promised,
Jean-Luc. I've returned you to
the present.
This is not the present I
remember. You said nothing would
change.
And nothing has changed... except
for you. But then, that's what
you wanted, wasn't it? To change
the man you were in your youth?
Well, you did it -- and this is
the man you are today.
You should be happy... you have a
real heart beating in your chest
and you get to live out the rest
of your life in safety... running
tests... making analyses... and
carrying reports to your
superiors.
... so tell Duffy that we'll need
to adjust the main deflector later
this afternoon. Oh, and have him
look into that inducer problem.
Hi, Jean-Luc. What's new in
astrophysics?
Do you need something?
I have the... spectral analysis
for you.
Thanks.
Lynch, try shunting the power
through the lateral conduit.
So where's the problem... ?
What's going on?
Oh, something's causing a power
spike in the starboard warp coil.
If I don't track it down soon, the
Captain's going to have my head on
a platter.
Have you tried flushing the
transfer conduits with trioxina?
No.
The conduits sometimes get blocked
by neutrino emissions when the
plasma --
Hey... I know you're trying to
make full Lieutenant this year...
but I think we can handle this
from here.
Am I interrupting?
Not at all. Have a seat.
I wonder if I could talk with you
for a moment... about my future on
the Enterprise.
Of course, Lieutenant. Jean-Luc,
isn't it?
Maybe I should go.
No, please Counselor... I would
very much like to hear your
thoughts...
First of all... I'd like you to be
straightforward with me. How do
you evaluate me as an officer?
Your performance reports have
always been good. You're
thorough... dedicated...
Reliable, steady...
...punctual.
I see.
What would you say if I told you
I thought I was capable of being
more than that...
Maybe we should discuss this at
your next evaluation...
I'd very much appreciate it if we
could discuss it now.
I would like to try... to move
beyond astrophysics... into
engineering or security perhaps.
Something which might even lead to
a command.
Frankly, Lieutenant... I don't
think that's realistic...
Why?
I really don't think this is the
place to be discussing --
Please. This is important to me.
I know I can do more.
Hasn't this been the problem all
along? Throughout your career...
you've had lofty goals... but
you've never been willing to do
what's necessary to attain them.
Would that be your evaluation as
well, Commander?
I'd have to agree with the
Counselor. You talk about wanting
more... but when it comes to doing
something about it, you hang back.
If you want to get ahead, you have
to take chances... stand out from
the crowd... get noticed.
I see.
We don't want to lose you...
you're a good officer.
Just not -- one who stands out.
Look... why don't I talk to
Commander La Forge... maybe
there's something in Engineering.
But... command?
Well... we'll see.
Senior officers please report to
the Captain's Ready Room.
Acknowledged.
I think we should talk about this
later.
All right, Q. Enough of this.
You've made your point.
Q... ?
La Forge to Lieutenant Picard.
I'm still waiting for your final
sensor usage log.
I'm on my way, sir.
Main Engineering.
Are you having a good laugh now,
Q? Does it amuse you to think of
me living out the rest of my life
as a dreary man in a tedious job?
I gave you something most mortals
never experience... a second
chance at life. And now all you
can do is complain?
I can't live out my days as that
person. That man is bereft of
passion and imagination. That's
not who I am.
Au contraire. He's the person you
wanted to be... one who was less
arrogant, and undisciplined as a
youth.
One who was less like me.
The Jean-Luc Picard you wanted to
be, the one who did not fight the
Nausicaan, had quite a different
career from the one you remember.
That Picard never had a brush with
death... never came face to face
with his own mortality... never
realized how fragile life is...
how important each moment can
be... so his life never came into
focus. He drifted through much of
his career, with no plan or
agenda... going from one
assignment to the next, never
seizing the opportunities that
presented themselves...
He didn't lead the Away Team on
Milika Three to save that
ambassador... he didn't take
charge of the Stargazer's Bridge
when its Captain was killed...
and no one ever offered him a
command.
He learned to play it safe. And
he never, ever got noticed by
anyone.
You're right. You gave me the
chance to change and I took that
opportunity. But I freely admit
now that it was a mistake.
Are you asking me for something,
Jean-Luc?
Yes.
Give me a chance to put things
back to the way they were before.
Before, you died in Sickbay. Is
that what you want?
I would rather die as the man I
was... than live the life I just
saw.
Please.
Coward. Like all Starfleet. You
talk and you talk... but you have
no guramba.
What did you say?
I said you are a coward.
That's what I thought you said.
His vital signs are stabilizing...
Captain... ? Jean-Luc... ?
You've been injured... but I think
it's going to be all right.
... I still don't know what to make
of it all. Was it a dream? Or
one of Q's elaborate tricks?
A lot of people who've been near
death have talked about strange
experiences... but they're not
usually so detailed.
Part of me cannot accept the idea
that Q would have given me a
second chance... that he would
demonstrate that much...
compassion.
But if it was Q... I owe him a
debt of gratitude.
In what sense? It sounds like he
put you through hell.
There were many things in my youth
that I'm not proud of... they were
loose threads... untidy parts of
myself that I wanted to remove.
But when I pulled on one of those
threads... I unravelled the
tapestry of my life.
I was just trying to imagine you
as a hell-bent-for-leather young
officer insulting a Nausicaan
twice your size. I wish I'd
gotten a chance to meet that Jean-Luc
Picard.
Well, to tell the truth... that
wasn't the first time I'd had a
run-in with a couple of surly
Nausicaans...
Really?
Oh, yes...
During my sophomore year I was
assigned to do some training on
Morikin Seven. Well, there was a
Nausicaan outpost on one of the
outlying asteroids...
