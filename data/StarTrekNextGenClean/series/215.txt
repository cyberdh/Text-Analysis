Captain's log, stardate 45571.2.
We are going into orbit around
an unexplored M-class moon of
Mab-Bu Six. Though the moon was
reported to be uninhabited, we
have picked up a weak distress
call.
The intense electromagnetic
whirlwinds on the moon's surface
make it virtually impossible to
locate the source of the signal,
sir...
Any indications of life, Mister
Worf?
Scanners read negative, sir. But
they may be affected by the
interference.
Have you ever heard anything like
that, Data?
I believe so, Commander... at
Starfleet Academy...
The Academy?
Yes, sir, let me verify it...
As I thought, sir... it is a
Starfleet subspace distress
signal... standard to Daedalus
class starships...
There hasn't been a Daedalus class
in service for... what... ?
One hundred seventy-two years,
Commander...
Any record of missing ships in
this vicinity, Data?
The U.S.S. Essex under the command
of Captain Bryce Shumar
disappeared in this sector over
two centuries ago...
Daedalus class...
Yes, Captain... I have accessed
the subspace transponder signature
of the Essex... it is identical
to the signal coming from the moon's
surface...
We've arrived a little late...
Mute it, Data.
With the storm activity down
there, I don't think it's worth
the risk to check on a ghost ship,
Number One... advise Starfleet
we've solved the mystery of
Captain Shumar and the Essex...
I'm not sure we have...
Someone's down there... alive...
First officer's log, supplemental.
The electromagnetic interference
on the surface was judged too
dangerous for anyone to transport
down. So we have taken a
shuttle to investigate.
Shields are holding...
Wind shear is incredible, Data...
keep an eye on the stabilizers...
If it's anything like this on the
ground, I don't see how anyone
could survive on this moon for
long.
Maybe they've been living
underground.
Question is where? I still can't
locate the source of the damn
signal... it's bouncing around
more than we are...
Sir, forward thrusters have
failed. We are losing power.
Enterprise... ?
Go ahead.
We've lost our thrusters...
attempting to compensate with
secondary boosters...
Sir? The shuttle's impulse
generators have shut down...
Commander? Can you hear me?
Enterprise to shuttle, please
respond.
Hold on! We're going down...
Initiating emergency landing
procedures...
Maintain the approach attitude
Data... I'm taking her in...
The shuttle has crashed on the
surface...
Do you have their position?
I am picking up the shuttle's
trace signature... but the surface
interference is distorting its
position...
Can you locate them...
I think I can... I followed their
entry almost all the way in...
we can calculate the coordinates
from their angle of descent...
Enterprise?
It is unlikely, sir, that we will
be able to establish communication
with the ship, given the severe
electromagnetic interference...
Then we'll stay put right here
until the Enterprise finds us...
Data, run an inventory of what's
still usable inside the shuttle.
Yes sir.
Your arm...
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's
broken...
The surface is composed of
nonporous rock... makes me
think it's even more unlikely
anyone could live here...
There are no instruments left of
practical value that have not been
damaged by the impact of our
landing.
What is that?
Doesn't look like any storm front
I've ever seen...
The tricorder is picking up high
levels of E-M bursts across the
spectrum.
Are you picking up anything else,
Data... like signs of life... ?
Other than our own, sir...
negative.
There is someone alive here...
I'm more certain of it now than
ever...
Well, I hope they can find us...
because we don't have a way to
find them...
They're coming... they're coming
with the storm...
We can't get a pattern lock on
the communicators because of the
E-M bursts, Captain. There's
no way to beam them out of
there... not under these
conditions...
The same conditions won't permit
a shuttle to land safely, Mister
LaForge... any suggestions... ?
Sir, let me beam down with a
pattern enhancer...
Chief, there's no guarantee you
won't rematerialize in a million
pieces if your signal gets caught
up in that electromagnetic
whirlwind...
I can boost the confinement
beam. One person might be able
to make it...
Captain, Chief O'Brien wants to
beam down to the surface with a
pattern enhancer...
His chances of getting down there
safely are no better than fifty-
fifty in my judgement...
Captain, a major storm front is
moving in on the away team's
coordinates...
Mister O'Brien... you are aware
of the risks?
Yessir. I think I can make it.
Prepare to transport.
Aye, sir.
Glad you could join us.
Great spot for a picnic, sir.
We need to distribute the enhancer
rods at seven meter legs... that
ought to do it...
Storm front going to affect the
transport, Chief... ?
I'd really like to get us out of
here before it hits, Commander...
see, I'm supposed to be feeding
the baby lunch... Molly gets in
a terribly foul mood if I'm
late...
I'm with you...
Lunch time, O'Brien! Let's do
it!
Easy, Deanna...
W-where... ?
You're back on the Enterprise...
Everything's okay now.
But my skin... It's tingling.
You are experiencing some
afterimages from the
electromagnetic discharge. The
sensation will pass. Try to
relax...
They're all fine, too. Now take
your time, Counselor, okay?
Doctor's orders.
Injury report, Doctor?
Mostly minor abrasions. But
Commander Riker took the worst
of it with a broken arm... The
biofilter scans showed their
nervous systems were generating
unusally high levels of synaptic
energy. I don't think it's
anything to worry about...
Good work, Mister O'Brien.
Thank you, sir.
Ready for duty, Captain.
Are you sure, Number One?
It's not the first bone I've
broken.
And how are you, Counselor?
Very glad to be here.
What happened down there?
It was just one hell of a storm...
moved in on our position faster
than anything I've ever seen.
Did you find any evidence of
life?
No, but if Troi was right, we
weren't far away from it...
Bridge.
How do you suggest we proceed?
We're gonna have to find a way
to modify the scanners to
penetrate those storms. Got any
ideas, Data... ?
It is p-p-possible we might be
able to employ virtual imaging
to interpolate missing data...
Is there something wrong, Data?
My apologies. It seems my primary
speech processors are experiencing
a minor fluctuation. I will have
it corrected in a... m-m-moment.
Captain... may I speak with you
a moment? In private?
Of course, Counselor.
Take the bridge, Number One.
Mister Data, deploy sensor scans
when you're ready. Ensign, move
into a synchronous orbit aligned
with our crash site.
Aye sir.
Sir? Given the E-M field
properties of this moon, I would
recommend a search pattern
beginning at the southern
p-p-polar region.
The polar region... But that's
starting from scratch, Data. The
last reading we had on the Essex
would suggest we begin the scans
near our crash site...
The Essex signal was never clearly
located, sir.
A broader, systematic survey of
the moon from a p-p-polar orbit
might be more practical.
Well, you might be right. Still,
I'd like to give the crash site
a once-over first... We'll
maintain our present orbit for
now.
Understood, sir.
I've never felt anything quite
like it... It was almost as though
they were calling to me...
Are you saying someone was
communicating telepathically,
Counselor?
Perhaps. For an instant. It was
like their voices were carried
on the wind.
What were they trying to
communicate?
I'm not sure... but they were
calling me to the southern polar
region... I believe that's where
we should look for the Essex...
Commander? Did you override my
orbital heading?
Override them?
We've moved into a polar orbit.
I'm locked out, the helm isn't
responding...
Mister Data, do you know anything
about this?
Data... ?
Security to the bridge!
Computer, transfer command to
engineering... Full security
alert!
All command functions transferred
to engineering.
This way!
What happened?
He would not move to a polar
orbit.
You could not wait? The captain
would have done it for me...
Deck thirty-six. Engineering.
Computer, reenable bridge
control. Authorization:
Riker-Omega-Three...
Report...
They're in turbolift four.
Engaging turbolift override
controls, now...
They have t-t-trapped us... what
will we do?
What deck is this?
We are on deck ten.
Can you move us again?
I know how to override the bridge
command...
Activate all security fields on
decks eight through fifteen...
Sir? The turbolift is moving
again. They're still inside.
Initiate emergency bulkheads in
turboshaft four...
Aye, sir.
They've been stopped at deck
thirteen.
Mister Worf...
Do you know how to deactivate
this?
The computer will not allow us
to override an emergency
forcefield command...
My entity's artificial
substructure may be useful...
They've broken through a security
field, deck ten, section two...
Security to Ten Forward...
Shh... Mama's right here...
Everyone get down on the floor!
Miles... ?
On the floor!
Everyone down! Now!!
Multiple phaser shots in Ten
Forward.
Picard to Worf -- report.
Mister Worf... acknowledge.
Can you hear me, Lieutenant Worf?
Yes, bridge. He can hear you.
Position security teams at both
entrances...
Yes sir.
Mister La Forge, shut down all
computer access in Ten
Forward...
I can't, Captain. They've already
set up a remote security
lock-out... We'd have to shut down
all computer functions in the
saucer section...
Transporter room three, can you
get a pattern lock on Commander
Data, Counselor Troi and Chief
O'Brien in Ten Forward... ?
Attempting to lock on, sir...
You were correct. They are
attempting to engage their
transporters. But I know how to
shut them down.
Bridge, the entire transporter
array has been taken off-line and
placed in a diagnostic mode...
I can't override... it will take
a couple of hours to complete the
cycle...
How many people are down there?
Seventeen...
They just shut down the internal
scanners too, Captain.
Doctor Crusher to the bridge...
On my way.
What are you doing now?
I can reverse the p-polarity of
their forcefields to isolate this
room.
Good.
Their communicators. Now they
will learn nothing but what we
tell them.
They've done something to the
force fields on deck ten, section
one.
Geordi?
I don't recognize the
configurations...
But they've completely isolated
Ten Forward.
How about flooding their air vents
with anesthizine gas?
That won't affect Data. No
rescue plan will work if we don't
knock out all three of them.
A concussive charge would blow
out the security field. Then we
could go in with phasers on wide
beam. Stun everybody. Sort it
out later...
Doctor, go back to the biofilter
readouts taken during the away
team's transport from the moon's
surface... see if you can come
up with any kind of clue that
might explain this...
Ten Forward, this is Captain
Picard. I am prepared to discuss
this situation. There is no need
for further violence...
Please identify yourself.
They will now attempt to negotiate
for the safety and release of
their people.
Interesting. Under normal
circumstances, I would be
counseling the captain at a time
like this...
What would you tell him to do?
I would help him find a way to
secure our trust.
W-what are you looking at?
I am speaking to you, Klingon.
Attack me. Or are you afraid?
I have no fear of death.
And I have no fear of killing
you...
Stop it.
Please respond, Ten Forward. Are
there any members of my crew who
require medical assistance?
We can discuss your wounded,
Captain. But first, you will move
the ship.
Move it where?
You will will change the ship's
orbit to an inclination of eighty
degrees, south.
The southern polar region --
that's where Data tried to move
the ship.
And exactly what Troi asked me
to do, but why?
Ten Forward -- if you could be
more specific about our intended
destination, perhaps we could...
You have thirty seconds to change
your heading -- or additional
members of your crew will "require
medical attention."
We need to stabilize this
situation and play for time. I
suggest we move the ship as they
have asked. Agreed?
Set the new heading. But take
us there as slowly as you can...
Ten Forward, we are moving the
ship as you requested.
He's telling the truth... their
heading has changed...
I've compared the away team's last
transport trace patterns to
earlier records. They're exactly
the same, except in Troi, Data and
O'Brien there's an unusual
synaptic activity -- some kind
of anionic energy. It may be a
life-form superimposing neural
patterns onto our people.
Why wasn't I affected?
I don't know. But one difference
between you and the others was
that you were injured.
My broken arm...
The fracture caused pain receptors
to fire which may have made you
immune... to this energy.
If your theory is accurate, what
would happen if we inflicted pain
on the others...
That might force whatever it is
out of our people.
A plasma shock -- it would be
painful but it wouldn't cause any
physical harm.
I could hook up a modified laser
scanner to a plasma invertor...
What about Data?
A plasma shock would certainly
overload his neural net. It might
work for him too...
We'd have to find a way to
penetrate the forcefield around
Ten Forward.
I might be able to interrupt the
forcefield for a few seconds...
but I'll be fighting the computer
for control... timing would be
critical...
We'd have to hit all three with
a single discharge... if they're
standing together, it shouldn't
be a problem...
How would you gain access?
We could use a micro-optic drill
through the ceiling and they'd
never detect it...
If this is going to work, we need
some way to contain that anionic
energy after we get it out of our
people.
Yes, Doctor... that will be your
top priority.
Very well. Proceed.
Bridge to Ten Forward. Now that
we are moving the ship as you
requested, I would like to know
the nature of the injuries to
members of my crew.
Five of your people have been
injured.
How serious is their condition?
You tell him, Klingon.
Captain. One person has
suffered what looks like a level
five phaser hit...
And four others have secondary
burns. They require medical
attention...
And our captors are not affected
by phaser stun settings...
Silence, Klingon.
Ten Forward -- those people must
be released so they can receive
proper medical treatment.
I will release no one.
If you release the wounded...
I will take their place.
It may be a... d-deception.
The crew values Picard's life
above all others...
Captain Picard. We agree to your
proposal.
Expect a medical team to accompany
me.
Acknowledged.
Picard to sickbay. Send an
emergency medical team to meet
me outside Ten Forward.
Sir, putting you down there just
strengthens their position.
As long as they're on board, I'm
a hostage no matter where I am.
We all are. I must find out who
we are dealing with...
If La Forge and Ro can attempt
a rescue in short order, proceed
with it. If they can't... I'll
provide you with another
opportunity. Watch for it.
Yes, sir...
Silence that... ch-child!
I know you. I know who you
are...
And I know who this is...
She's frightened... why don't you
let us go?
No. Make it stop.
Ten Forward, we are outside the
door.
Lower the force field.
Welcome, Captain. Allow me to
introduce myself...
I am Captain Bryce Shumar, of the
Federation Starship Essex.
The Starship Essex vanished over
two hundred years ago...
Indeed. I know. I was there.
This is my First Officer...
Commander Steven Mullen.
And my Security Chief...
Lieutenant Morgan Kelly.
You're telling me that you've
survived this long as...
Spirits? Ghosts? But you are
a man who would never believe in
ghosts, Picard. Isn't that true?
You see, I know you. Troi knows
you. And so I do, as well.
Then Counselor Troi is still...
alive?
Yes, of course she is, and I have
no wish to harm her. Or to harm
anyone else.
I'm pleased to hear that.
We have been forced to take this
action because we need your help,
Captain.
My help... ?
Our consciousness has been trapped
on this moon for two centuries...
we must escape this torture...
How did this happen to you?
I cannot explain how it occurred,
only that it did.
The Essex was caught in an
electromagnetic storm just as your
shuttle was. Moments before we
crashed, the bridge was struck
by lightning. The ship was ripped
apart. Somehow, in that instant,
our consciousness was absorbed
in the magnetic currents on the
surface.
Why didn't you tell us this? Why
the deception, the violence?
As I said, Captain. I knew you
wouldn't believe us. Even now,
I'm sure you do not.
What was your vessel designation
and complement?
NCC One-seven-three... Daedalus
class starship. Crew of two
hundred twenty-nine.
Under whose command in this
sector?
Admiral Uttan Narsu, Starbase
Twelve. You will find all of this
in Starfleet records...
I do not need to see the records.
Then you know I am correct.
End this now and I will do
whatever I can to help you...
No. You do not trust me. And
I cannot risk trusting you.
It is taking too long. We
sh-should have been there by
now...
He is manipulating you...
Captain Picard has every right
to be curious...
He will try to delay until a
rescue attempt is possible.
I know that. But I also know that
he will make every effort to
protect the lives of his crew.
Since our demands are not
excessive, I hope you will see
it is simpler to accede than to
risk further injuries.
What do you want?
All you need to know for now,
Captain, is that we want to rest.
Simply, finally... to rest.
... Section Two - B... A... Section
One...
Finally. I hope I never see
this part of the Enterprise
again...
I hear you. This is what starship
designers call "easy access"...
This is it. I thought we might
have a problem with conduit two-
twenty-seven -- but it looks like
we can get by it...
We're through...
Let's hook up the scanner and see
what we've got...
Got it...
All three of them have to be in
the circle if it's going to
work...
We're halfway home...
La Forge to Crusher. How's it
going?
I think I've come up with an
idea for a containment field.
This anionic energy seems to
be vulnerable to the same magnetic
flux density we monitored in the
storms. If I can duplicate
that, we can trap it once it's
out of our people.
You ought to be able to do it
by pumping Ten Forward full of
ionogenic particles.
Exactly what I was thinking...
How long will it take to get it
all ready?
We still have to calibrate the
plasma invertor, Commander... I'm
guessing forty-five minutes to
an hour...
I'll have the containment field
ready by then.
Keep me advised.
Impressions, Mister Worf?
Spiritual possessions of this sort
have been reported throughout
Klingon history. It is called
"Jat'yIn" -- the taking of the
living by the dead.
Yes, Human history is also full
of similar legends.
Then, you believe they may be
telling the truth?
Not for a moment.
Sir, they seem to know much about
the Essex... if it really is the
spirit of Captain Shumar...
... then he should be on much
better behavior, don't you
think... ? A Starfleet Captain?
After living disembodied for two
centuries, perhaps they have gone
mad...
Mister Worf, I assure you these
are not Jat'yIn. Our job is to
find out what they are... and 
then to determine how to deal 
with them...
Stop speaking!
I gave you that...
In a place called McKinley Park.
Green grass... tall trees.
Please... don't...
I hid the bracelet... in your
pocket. You were... surprised.
...please...
You said, "You make me so happy,
Miles."
Get away from me.
Get away.
Leave her alone.
Captain Shumar...
We will reach the polar position
you requested in minutes... I will
need to give additional
instructions...
Very well. We are taking you to
our crash site...
At the southern pole... ?
That is correct.
Nothing our sensors were able to
detect indicated that the Essex
went down in the polar region...
Well, it d-did.
I told you, Captain... the ship
broke apart in the atmosphere.
The bridge went down here.
When we reach it, you are going
to beam what's left of our
skeletal remains aboard this
ship... and take them back to
Earth for a proper burial.
See how simple a request it is... ?
Let these people go... and I
will order the bridge to follow
your instructions.
No. No one will be released.
If you are who you say you are,
there is no need for any of
this... we will gladly take you
home.
I wish you were truly so
open-minded, Picard...
If you do not release the
hostages, I will not cooperate.
You will cooperate... you will
c-cooperate... or someone will
die, Captain... who will it
be... ?
How about the Klingon?
Get another one.
You.
No... please...
Pick one to die, Captain. Or I
will kill them both...
Choose me, Captain.
They're all in range. I need
to do it now...
I'm only gonna be able to shut
down the forcefield for about
seven seconds before the computer
compensates...
If they're the right seven
seconds, it'll be enough...
Bridge, stand by to release the
ionogenic field on my signal...
Standing by...
Ready...
Kill the forcefield!
Forcefield down...
Firing plasma charge...
Damn... !
Tell them to stop, or I'll kill
everyone in this room! Starting
with you.
Picard to bridge. Abort
immediately.
As you say, Captain...
Riker to La Forge, return to the
bridge.
Are you prepared to cooperate?
Yes.
First officer's log, supplemental.
The Enterprise has moved into a
synchronous orbit near the
southern polar region. We await
further instructions from Ten
Forward.
Any sign of the Essex?
Negative, Commander. The
electromagnetic disturbances
are even worse here... scanners
can't read a thing...
Bridge to Ten Forward.
Intense storm activity over the
southern pole is making it
virtually impossible for us to
pick up any trace of the Essex...
We're giving you the exact
coordinates of our remains
aboard the wreck of the Essex...
I'm receiving the coordinates
now...
Geordi, can you tell what's there?
Just your basic ionic cyclone.
I can't read a thing.
I'm sure as hell not going to just
beam up whatever might be down
there...
I've got a good excuse for you.
The transporters aren't going to
work any better than the
scanners...
Bridge to Ten Forward... the same
interference that is blocking our
scanners would prevent us from
using the transporters...
They're lying...
On the contrary, we've had a
difficult time with transport
since our arrival... that's why
we had to send down the shuttle.
You should all be well aware of
that fact.
We must be able to use the
transporters...
In fact, Chief O'Brien was the
one who successfully executed the
return of the away team... he is
the most qualified on board to
operate the transporter under
these circumstances...
Can you do it from here?
No... I would have to use a
transporter pad.
I would be willing to grant you
safe passage to the transporter
pad in one of the cargo bays...
It is a trick... he is trying to
divide us...
We must not be separated.
I offer to grant you all safe
passage.
Why are you b-being so helpful
suddenly?
Because I assume if you go to the
cargo bay, you will choose not
to take all of the hostages.
Their safety is my primary
concern.
What are the risks when we leave
this room?
Without the p-protection of the
forcefield, we are vulnerable in
a number of ways...
They could use the transporter
against us... Once the
forcefield's down, they could
beam us back to the surface.
But there is a way to neutralize
that threat...
Bridge, transfer all transporter
functions to Ten Forward...
Ten Forward, in order to do that,
you'll have to release your
computer control lock-outs...
That is not true...
Let me speak to him.
Number One, I think we have an
opportunity to end this seige...
But it will require cooperation
from all concerned. Our guests
will be moving shortly to cargo
bay four, where the transport will
occur. You are to ensure their
safe passage from Ten Forward to
the cargo bay.
Understood, Captain.
Mister La Forge, Doctor...
Aye, sir...
Transporter controls are being
transferred...
Ten Forward to bridge. I said all
transporter controls. Including
those aboard all your
shuttlecraft.
Almost had them, Ensign... nice
try...
Ten Forward. Our mistake.
Remaining transporter functions
are being transferred to you...
By creating our own access code,
we will be able to prevent anyone
from using the transporter against
us as we move to the cargo bay...
What about their weapons?
We will each take a hostage for
protection... Captain Picard, you
are mine.
Please... let her stay...
Lower the forcefield.
Security teams, stand by.
They're heading through section
five...
Mister La Forge, Doctor --
they'll be at their destination
in less than a minute...
They've stopped at deck eighteen,
sir...
Security, allow them access into
cargo bay four...
I will require some assistance.
Captain Shumar, may I ask a
foolish question?
You are not one to ask foolish
questions, Picard...
Nevertheless, I must ask how you
intend to achieve your "rest"...
when all is said and done...
What do you mean?
How do you intend to free yourself
of this existence that has
trapped your consciousness?
It will fade as we move further
from this planet...
Really? What is your scientific
basis for that?
I don't need a scientific basis.
Just be quiet.
Perhaps you will be required to
perform a noble deed before you
can rest.
What are you talking about?
Surely you recall the old story
of "The Canterville Ghost"...
Do not insult me with foolish
ghost stories, Picard...
I would ask the same of you.
When are you going to tell me
who you really are?
I have initialized the
transporter signal...
Proceed.
They're powering up the
transporter, Commander...
Mister LaForge...
I've isolated cargo bay four with
a neutrino field, sir... But it
won't take O'Brien and Data more
than a couple of minutes to override
it once they discover it's
there...
I hope that'll be enough time
for the captain to play his
hand...
You know what he's going to do?
There's only one reason he
chose cargo bay four...
If it becomes necessary, Ensign,
you will blow the cargo bay hatch
on my orders.
Aye, sir.
You're quite right, Picard.
We're not ghosts. And it is not
rest, we seek. Only escape.
Escape?
We were brought to this moon over
five centuries ago from a star
system called Ux-Mal... We were
separated from our bodies and left
to drift in the storms. Once
we almost escaped... on board
the Essex... but that ship was
incapable of eluding the moon's
electromagnetic currents...
Did you really think using their
identities would gain our
sympathy... ?
It was a better approach than
asking you to allow hundreds of
condemned prisoners on board...
Then, this moon is a penal
colony...
That is correct. But now
we have your ship... and your
bodies to carry us home...
I'm reading dozens of them...
hundreds...
They have the same anionic
signature we saw on the biofilter
scans...
I think we can give the captain
a new bargaining chip. Doctor
Crusher, flood the cargo bay with
your containment field...
Let them go, or you will all die.
Your threats are meaningless now.
We are still in control of these
three bodies. We will not leave
them.
Are you prepared to sacrifice the
lives of the others? Because they
will all die when the hatch to
the cargo bay is blown...
You will die too...
I would die to save the life of
my child.
To die defending his ship is the
hope of every Klingon.
And if you each know the officers
you inhabit, you know they are
equally ready to give their lives
for this ship.
Free them now... And I will return
you to the moon's surface.
I advise you, Picard, not to pass
our way again.
Picard to bridge, our guests will
be leaving shortly... I need an
emergency medical team here...
On our way, Captain.
Mister Worf, transport these...
prisoners... back to the moon's
surface...
Gladly, sir...
It was almost as though my own
consciousness were pushed to the
side... I was watching it all
happen... hearing my own voice...
but I couldn't control any of
it...
What about the entity that
controlled you... what were your
perceptions of him?
He was intelligent, actually.
Thoughtful... in a ruthless
sort of way. Cold.
I must apologize for my
inadvertant misconduct toward you,
Lieutenant.
There is no need to apologize.
Your restraint was most remarkable
for a Klingon.
You have no idea.
How do you feel?
Hungry.
Good sign.
How do you feel?
I'm just glad to have you back.
If I could've killed that thing
inside me... I would have...
I know.
We both know.
