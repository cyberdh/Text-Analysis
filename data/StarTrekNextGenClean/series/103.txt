			Captain's log, Stardate 41209.2.
			We are running at Warp 7 to
			rendezvous with the science vessel
			S. S. Tsiolkovsky...
			... which has been routinely
			monitoring the collapse of a red
			supergiant star into a white
			dwarf. What has brought us here
			is a series of strange messages
			indicating something has gone
			wrong aboard the research vessel.
			Well, hello Enterprise.
			Welcome... I hope you have a lot
			of pretty boys on board... because
			I'm willing... and waiting...
			S.S. Tsiolkovsky, repeat your
			message.
			In fact... we're going to have a
			real blowout here... Thought that
			would interest you. Waiting!
			Captain... what we just heard is,
			well...impossible.
			Report.
			I believe that last sound we heard
			was an emergency hatch being
			blown.
			Are you certain... yes, of course
			you are.
			Sensor scan now reveals no life
			signs aboard, Captain.
			Put us on their bridge, Chief.
			Life support systems are not
			functioning in that area, sir.
			Then put us in the main corridor.
			Energize.
			Cover the ship as planned. Move
			out.
			Indications of what humans would
			call... a "wild party?"
			Their bridge. If this thing
			works, be sure to record ---
			You were right. Somebody blew
			the hatch and they were all sucked
			out into space..
			Correction, sir, blown out.
			Thank you, Data.
			A common mistake, sir...
			I know! Thank you, Data.
			Commander Riker, it's Lieutenant
			Yar, location Engineering. Ten
			people here, sir, all frozen.
			No vital signs.
			Frozen how?
			Looks to me like someone was
			"playing" with the environmental
			controls, sir. Just let all the
			heat bleed away into space.
			That's ridiculous!
			That's what I say, sir.
			Sir, Lieutenant LaForge in the
			crew quarters. Something in here.
			Hello!
			Riker to Captain, I have a report
			for you.
			Picard here.
			They're all dead, sir. Some were
			apparently blown out the emergency
			hatches.
			There were eighty people on that
			ship, Number One.
			Yes sir. As I said, all dead.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			are downloading the research
			information gathered on the
			collapsing...
			... star nearby. I am concerned
			at being in such close orbit, but
			the Tsiolkovsky's research
			records...
			... will no doubt predict the time
			of the star's final collapse.
			I can't find anything unusual in
			any of the tricorder readings
			they've sent over, Captain.
			Give me a theory, Doctor.
			Anything!
			Troi? Did you feel anything from
			over there?
			Perhaps some residual
			confusion... and exhilaration, too.
			But I'm not too certain of that.
			Madness? Mass hysteria?
			Delusion?
			Any or all, Captain.
			All right. Let's bring the away
			team back. Set the transporter
			for maximum decontamination. And
			then full examinations and
			observation when they're here.
			If you were any more perfect,
			Data, I'd write you up in a
			Starfleet medical textbook.
			I am already listed in several
			biomechanical texts, Doctor.
			Yes... of course.
			You're next, Lieutenant.
			Normal -- all across.
			Except... why are you perspiring?
			I suppose because you have it too
			hot in here. What else would it
			be?
			That doesn't... sound exactly like
			you, Geordi.
			Maybe it wasn't.
			Maybe she threw her voice.
			Joke.
			Of course. But I would like to
			run another test or two on you,
			Lieutenant.
			Sickbay to Bridge...
			Picard here. Go ahead, Doctor.
			I'm confining Lieutenant LaForge
			to Sickbay until further notice.
			Do we have a problem, Doctor?
			I don't know yet.
			Data, I need help in locating some
			library-computer information.
			Specifics, sir?
			All I have is a vague memory of
			reading somewhere about someone
			taking a shower in his or her
			clothing.
			Ah. The body Geordi discovered.
			And I believe it may have happened
			before.
			To "someone," "somewhere."
			Should be easy for someone written
			up in biomechanical texts.
			About that... did the doctor
			believe I was boasting?
			Probably.
			This may take some time?
			At least several hours.
			But what I said was a statement
			of fact.
			Perhaps she will look it up.
			You can depend on it.
			Geordi!
			Security! Lieutenant LaForge
			just left Sickbay while my back
			was turned. It's important we
			find him.
			Security team alert, pick up
			Lieutenant LaForge who left
			Sickbay moments ago.
			Captain, anything further?
			Affirmative. Make it a ship-wide
			search, Lieutenant.
			It's a model of the same kind of
			tractor beam our ship uses... with
			some ideas of my own added.
			So that's your science project.
			Wes, you are something!
			Meanwhile, the captain won't let
			me visit the bridge.
			So I use this to imagine I'm
			there.
			Take the helm, Mister Crusher.
			Set a course for thirty-seven mark
			one hundred eighty. Warp six.
			That's the captain's voice.
			Pieced together from words he's
			used on the intercom.
			I can pretend he's ordering me
			to take the Enterprise anywhere.
			And listen to this...
			Chief Engineer, report to the
			Bridge. Commander Riker, report
			to the Bridge. Doctor Crusher,
			report to the Bridge.
			What d'you think?
			I think the captain's lucky you're
			on his side.
			But he still won't let me on the
			bridge. And there's nothing there
			I don't understand.
			Wish I understood myself that
			well.
			You okay?
			No. Suddenly I seem to be burning
			up inside.
			Wow it's hot in here.
			Geordi... ?
			Medical's been worried about you.
			Help me.
			Lieutenant Yar in the Observation
			Lounge. Send a team here now.
			Tasha... I said "help me." Help
			me not to give in to the wild
			things coming into my mind...
			Geordi -- my job is security...
			Please.
			Yes, helping is more important.
			How can I help you Geordi?
			Help me to see like you do.
			But you already see better than
			I can.
			I see more. But more isn't
			better!
			Geordi...
			I want to see in shallow, dim,
			beautiful human ways.
			We'll talk about it, Geordi.
			I'm going to take you to Sickbay
			now. All right?
			Captain's log, supplemental. I
			am concerned that away team member
			Lieutenant LaForge has been taken
			to Sickbay. The report: "unusual
			behavior."
			... and then we got him down to
			sickbay so Dr. Crusher could
			examine him.
			He wasn't violent?
			No, sir. He was very upset... he
			kept talking about wanting normal
			eyes.
			Thank you, Lieutenant. I'll be
			in Sickbay.
			According to our medical readouts,
			there's still nothing wrong with
			him. He looks like he's running
			a temperature but every instrument
			we have says he's not.
			Doctor, every person on that ship
			over there died. Is there any
			chance that whatever did it is
			loose on my ship?
			If you mean a disease, sir, I'd
			say there's no chance of it. We
			used full decontamination, we
			examined each team member
			carefully...
			The entire crew over there somehow
			managed to kill themselves,
			Doctor. If it wasn't a disease,
			what else could have made them
			do that?
			The obvious alternatives would
			be in areas of insanity, severe
			emotional upset...
			Troi, do you feel anything unusual
			in the lieutenant here?
			Security reported he was longing
			for normal eyesight. A rather
			sudden yearning for that.
			Since his records show no previous
			mention of that, the fact that it's
			happened now could be important.
			But all I feel from him is
			confusion. If I didn't know
			better, I'd say he was
			intoxicated.
			Our tests would have shown that.
			Also any signs of drugs,
			hallucinogens or other
			contaminants.
			Can you provide more information,
			sir? Seeking an instance of
			someone showering with their
			clothing on is...is...
			I know... like looking for a needle
			in a haystack.
			Why should anyone wish to expend
			their time in such a search?
			Correction, Data, I should have
			said proverbial needle in a
			haystack.
			Ah, a human proverb! As in
			folklore, or an historical
			allusion, or tribal memories,
			or...
			That's it! Historical! I
			remember now that I was reading
			a history of all the past
			starships named Enterprise.
			Enterprise history. Aberrant
			behavior. Medical cross
			reference...
			Captain, I believe we've got the
			answer to what happened over
			there.
			The Constitution class Enterprise,
			Captain James T. Kirk
			commanding...
			Similar conditions. They were
			monitoring a planet that was
			breaking up, not a collapsing star
			as in this case, but there were
			the same huge shifts in gravity...
			... which somehow resulted in
			complex strings of water
			molecules which then acquired
			carbon from the body and acted
			on the brain like alcohol!
			Mister Data, download that
			information immediately to
			medical.
			Aye sir, downloading.
			Fascinating! Their entire crew
			going out of control...
			Like intoxication but worse.
			Judgment almost completely
			impaired...
			Until they found this formula,
			barely in time.
			Picard to Doctor Crusher, come
			in.
			This is Crusher; go ahead Captain.
			You can relax, Doctor. The answer
			to all this is feeding into your
			medical banks now... including a
			cure.
			Are you certain, Captain?
			Absolutely!
			Tasha?
			What're you doing?
			I need your advice. That's why
			I came to your quarters.
			Of course. Anything I can do ---
			On clothes. You always wear such
			beautiful clothes off duty. And
			your hair's so nice all the time.
			I want to change my image.
			What about this color?
			Not for you. Tasha, I feel you're
			very uncertain... that you're
			fighting something.
			What is it?
			Never mind. I'll find what I need
			myself. Ship's Stores will have
			it.
			Tasha, wait ---
			Troi to Captain Picard.
			Picard here.
			Sir, I think Tasha's been
			infected, too. She's just left
			my quarters...
			It's not actually an "infection,"
			Counselor.
			Yes sir, it's more like
			intoxication, but whatever it is,
			she's got it.
			Thank you, Counselor.
			Number One, our security chief
			has the equivalent of a snootful.
			Inquiry, sir... 'snootful?'
			Forget it!
			Mom, Look what I can do...
			I've been able to widen and
			strengthen the beam, just like
			I told you last night ---
			Do me a favor, Wes? There's
			something happening on this
			ship...
			Just to be safe, I'd like you to
			stay in our quarters until it's
			solved.
			Right, Mom, right. Your wish
			is my...
			Now, Wes.
			You could be stunting my emotional
			growth, you know.
			Why's it so hot in here, anyway?
			Picard to Crusher. Have you made
			a test injection yet? We're
			getting indications that this
			condition is spreading.
			No test yet, Captain, but very
			soon.
			Come to Papa; come to Papa... !
			Captain, in another forty-one minutes
			will see the information from the
			Tsiolkovsky downloaded to us.
			Why so slow?
			Slow, sir? The Tsiolkovsky has
			been eight months in accumulating
			it.
			How much danger from that star?
			Worse case.
			Like a full collapse, sir?
			Any stellar material it threw this
			way we could still outrun on half
			impulse power.
			Picard to Engineering. Chief
			engineer report to the bridge.
			Assistant Chief Engineer Shimoda
			report to Medical.
			Hi, Jim. Was that the captain
			sending you to Medical?
			Which would leave no one on duty
			here. The chief was just
			summoned to the bridge.
			What about me? I could call your
			chief on the bridge if anything
			happens.
			Reporting as ordered, sir.
			What?
			You ordered me to report to the
			bridge, sir.
			I did no such thing. I want you
			down in the Engine Room in case
			we need to move out of here.
			Attention all decks, all
			divisions. Effective
			immediately, I have handed over
			control of this vessel to
			Acting Captain Wesley Crusher.
			Acting Capt...
			Thank you, Captain Picard, thank
			you. And with that order dawns
			a brave new day for the
			Enterprise.
			Captain's log, Stardate 41209.3.
			The strange contaminant that led
			to the deaths of the Tsiolkovsky
			crew is now aboard the
			Enterprise... and our Engineering
			Section has been commandeered by
			young Wesley Crusher...
			Number One, MacDougal -- get that
			boy out of Engineering.
			Sir, I'm getting very strange
			reports from all decks --
			Such as?
			Such as the ship's training
			division ordering all officers
			to attend a lecture on
			metaphysics.
			Metaphysics?
			Confirmed, sir. And there is a
			rather peculiar limerick being
			delivered by someone in the
			shuttlecraft bay. I am not sure
			I understand it...
			There was a young lady from Venus
			whose body was shaped like --
			Captain to Security, come in!
			Did I say something wrong?
			I don't understand their humor
			either.
			Yeah, Captain?
			Where's my security chief?! Get
			me Lieutenant Yar.
			Keep your britches on, Captain.
			Captain Picard...
			Yar, where are you?
			I'm in my quarters and pretty busy
			right at this moment, Jean-Luc.
			All right, Lieutenant, just stay
			right there.
			Data, please go to Lieutenant Yar
			and get her down to Sickbay.
			Yes, sir.
			Security, I want all your senior
			supervisors to report to the
			bridge immediately.
			... and a dessert course shall
			henceforth precede and follow
			every meal. Including breakfast.
			Hurray for the acting captain!
			Never got as far as Sickbay, Wes.
			I feel too good for that.
			Incredible! How did you do that?
			Hooked my model tractor beam into
			ship's power. Now its a repulser
			beam too.
			Want in?
			Swear to be faithful to you,
			Captain!
			Lieutenant Yar?
			Here, Data.
			You wanted me?
			Captain Picard ordered me to
			escort you to Sickbay, Lieutenant.
			Did he say when?
			I am sure he meant "now."
			So you need time to get into
			uniform...
			But I got out of uniform for you,
			Data. Do you know how old I was
			when I was abandoned?
			Chronological age? No, I am afraid
			I am not conversant with your ---
			Five. Five years old, but I
			survived. I learned how to stay
			alive, how to avoid the rape
			gangs. I was fifteen before I
			escaped.
			I am sorry. I did not know...
			And what I want now is gentleness.
			And joy. And love.
			From you, Data. You are fully
			functional, aren't you?
			Of course, but...
			How fully?
			In every way, of course. I have
			been programmed in multiple
			techniques, a broad variety of
			pleasuring...
			You jewel! That's exactly what
			I hoped.
			What have you learned, Number
			One?
			Captain, the ship's engines are
			cut off from the bridge. And I
			have the reason. The assistant
			chief engineer pulled out the
			isolinear optical chips from
			command and all engines are
			off-line.
			Wesley's hooked some kind of
			tractor beam into ship's power
			and has it aimed at the door.
			We can't get past it to get at
			the computer.
			Can you short out the power?
			Maybe.
			Yes, I can. But it's going to
			take time.
			Do it!
			Bill...
			Deanna, what -- ?
			So many minds on this ship,
			Bill... all free... released...
			Deanna --
			I can feel them all... what they
			feel... what they want... I feel
			a side of humans I've never felt
			before.
			Come on, I'm getting you to
			Sickbay.
			Wouldn't you rather be alone with
			me -- with me in your mind...
			The medical records we found say
			this works almost instantly.
			I've never seen a rainbow, Doc.
			Sunset. Sunrise. None of those.
			This is going to help me?
			Doctor Crusher...
			Didn't you hear me? Deanna needs
			your help.
			The formula from the old
			Enterprise didn't work.
			What?
			This water-carbon complex may
			induce the same symptoms, but it's
			different somehow. Maybe it's
			mutated. I'll have to isolate
			it... analyze it...
			We don't have that kind of time.
			You brought Deanna in?
			She's infected with it, too.
			You touched her? Oh, God, you
			touched me.
			You can't leave here --
			If we don't get our command
			computers back on-line soon, this
			-- whatever this is -- won't
			matter. We'll all be dead.
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			It is no longer an inconvenient
			childish prank. Young Wesley
			Crusher...
			Admittedly a victim of the
			Tsiolkovsky "infection"...
			... is now in control of my
			starship. How he acquired the
			engineering information and
			knowledge he is using, I have no
			idea.
			Wes, this is Captain Picard. Do
			you see me?
			Yes sir?
			You will now return all control
			of this vessel to the bridge where
			it belongs. Now.
			I'm sorry, sir. Why don't you
			just tell me what you want done
			and I'll...
			Because ship captains control
			their own vessels, young man!
			But, sir, you don't do it
			yourself. You give the orders,
			someone else does it. What's
			wrong with giving me the orders
			to do it?
			Captain, getting unusual readings
			now from the dwarf star... !
			Stand by a moment on that.
			Wesley... !
			Wes... are you aware that you're
			acting strangely... that a kind
			of "infection" was brought back
			from the Tsiolkovsky that acts
			like intoxication?
			Are you saying that's why I feel
			so... so "hot," so strange?
			That's a very adult bit of
			reasoning, Wes...
			Are you saying I'm "drunk?" I
			feel strange but also good.
			Because...
			Because you've lost the capacity
			for self-judgment. Alcohol does
			that but this contaminant we've
			brought back does it even more
			so.
			What would you do if you got your
			ship back?
			It's very important I do because
			we must immediately put a tractor
			beam on the Tsiolkovsky, then tow
			it out of...
			Tractor beams are my specialty,
			Skipper! I'll contact you when
			that's done; Wesley out!
			Wes!
			Conn, where are you headed?
			Sir!
			The star; it's beginning to
			collapse.
			What the hell is happening in
			Engineering?
			Lock on, Tsiolkovsky, lock
			on... lock on, Tsiolkovsky, lock
			on...
			You got the logic probe?
			Thanks.
			Where's the sonic driver?
			There. Let's see if this'll cut
			out his tractor beam power.
			Oh no! No, I must find the answer.
			Find the answer. Have to find
			the answer.
			Captain -- tractor beam! We just
			locked onto the Tsiolkovsky!
			Bridge to... to Wesley.
			Wesley Crusher, come in!
			Data! At least you're
			functioning.. !
			Fully, Captain, fully.
			Data, intoxication is a human
			condition. Your mind is
			different, it's not the same...
			We are more alike than unlike,
			my dear captain.
			I have pores. Humans have pores.
			I have fingerprints. Humans have
			fingerprints. My chemical
			nutrients are like your blood.
			If you prick me, do I not leak?
			If this can possibly wait,
			Doctor...
			May I see you in your Ready Room?
			It's a private matter... well,
			actually an urgent one...
			I'm busy, Doctor. Impossible.
			Damn!
			I believe I'm infected myself.
			Do you know what the infection
			is? Hurry!
			Sorry.
			It is definitely like alcohol
			intoxication, the same lack of
			good judgment...
			For example right now, I find you,
			well, extremely...extremely...
			Of course we haven't time for that
			sort of thing...
			What sort of thing?
			Oh God would I love to show you.
			Doctor, there must be a cure!
			Some formula, similar to the old
			one...
			Dammit... dammit, dammit, my dear
			captain. You owe me something.
			You do realize that, don't you?
			I'm a woman; I haven't the comfort
			of a husband, a man...
			Not now, Doctor, please...
			Bridge to Riker, urgent!
			Riker here.
			Sir, regret to inform you that
			the captain appears to be
			infected. And Data, and...
			Thank you, Lieutenant. I'm coming.
			You'll have to handle this.
			Are you saying you'll handle that?
			What we're seeing, sir, is a huge
			chunk of the star's surface blown
			off, heading for us!
			Take us...
			Are you alright, sir?
			Worf, you know what to do. Take
			us out of here.
			Sir, the controls are still off-line!
			Override!
			Same result, sir.
			Wes, come in please. Wesley
			Crusher, this is Riker. Come in.
			This is urgent!
			Engineering, urgent. We must have
			ship's power...
			Oh, no, those are control
			chips... !
			Bridge from Engineering...
			The star is still collapsing;
			we're directly in the path of...
			I can't help you, bridge!
			Someone's yanked out all the
			control chips here...
			It was an adult who did it!
			I estimate fourteen minutes until
			that mass gets here... !
			No way to replace chips in
			fourteen minutes, sir. I'd guess
			two hours, maybe three...
			Data could assemble them back
			faster.
			What's that?
			What's that Wesley?
			They're just simple isolinear
			chips, sir. To Data, anyway.
			He could shuffle them like cards.
			Come on Data. Hurry!
			Ship's log, First Officer Riker.
			The star has begun disintegrating.
			Enterprise will be destroyed
			unless it can be moved out of the
			path of the star material
			hurtling...
			... toward us. Our only hope is
			for Lieutenant Commander Data in
			the time we have left, to regain
			his senses and reconnect engine
			power to the Bridge.
			Hi, Mister Data.
			Nice to see you, Wesley. What... ?
			Data! We need the engines on-line
			in a hurry, remember?
			Oh yes, I remember too.
			So, Data, if you don't mind...
			We've no time for courtesy!
			Get those damned control chips
			back in place, Data! In the
			correct order!
			NOW!
			It's like a game of 'how fast can
			you do it?'
			Ah, a game!
			I think I can switch this to the
			main viewer, sir...
			We've got eight or nine minutes,
			at most, Data. Can you finish
			by then?
			No. This will take slightly more
			time than we have, sir.
			Dammit, NO! I can't afford to
			get it!
			Beverly...
			Yes, Jean-Luc?
			You will address me as Captain!
			In which case, dear Captain, you
			will address me as 'Chief Medical
			Officer' or 'Doctor.'
			That's true; I started off calling
			you 'Beverly,' then naturally,
			you...
			I'm still not thinking straight!
			Likewise. Where the hell was I
			just headed?
			If that's something you wanted
			to test...
			Yes, yes, on Geordi!
			Did you see how I reversed fields
			on this, Commander? Made it into
			a repulser beam.
			If we had just a minute more,
			sir...
			If this were a hundred times more
			powerful than it is...
			I made this a broader based
			remedy... I hope. But it's still
			close to the formula from the old
			Enterprise's records...
			Decades ago, light years away...
			But almost exactly the same
			conditions as here.
			What was in that, Doctor? My
			head's beginning to clear...
			Take this to Engineering. I'll
			make up more hypos for the others.
			Why not try it with the real
			thing?!
			Why not reverse fields on this,
			Ma'am? If we only need an extra
			minute...
			It would take weeks of laying out
			new circuits...
			But why not just see it in your
			head?
			Come off the main lead, split at
			the force activator,
			then...then...
			If I could just think straight
			about this...
			We didn't make it, Captain. If
			we had just a minute or so more...
			Yes, then reversing power leads,
			back through the force
			activator... repulser beam hard
			against the Tsiolkovsky...
			We're pushing away!
			Bridge, engage engines!
			Sir, something seemed to move us
			aside at the last minute.
			Do we owe our thanks to Commander
			Data, sir?
			Yes. And... Wesley may have given
			us a few seconds, too.
			Did he say Wesley? The boy?
			He said Wesley.
			It is only fair to mention Wesley
			in a log entry, sir.
			Fair is fair. And let's credit
			his science teacher, too.
			Congratulations, sir.
			To many people.
			Data! I'm only going to tell
			you this just once... It never
			happened.
			I put it to all of you we may end
			up with a fine crew... if we keep
			working at it.
			So let's get to our next job,
			Number One.
			Aye, sir. Helm, stand by for warp
			three. Heading two-hundred
			ninety-four mark thirty-seven.
			Warp three, two-hundred
			ninety-four mark thirty-seven,
			sir.
			Engage!
