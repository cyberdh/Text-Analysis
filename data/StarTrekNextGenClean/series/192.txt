Tarchannen Three Investigation.
Stardate 40164.7. Ensign Anthony
Brevelle Recording. Lieutenant
Susanna Leijten in command.
You up and running, Brevelle?
Yes, Lieutenant.
I've checked buildings Four and
Five... they're like all the
others... no phaser hits, no sign
of a fight. Looks like the entire
outpost just... vanished...
Lieutenant Leijten...
You'd better come see this...
No footprints... no vehicle
tracks. The wind probably erased
them... but look...
Freeze visual.
That's Hickman on the right...
that's Mendez on the left...
and as already noted, the
recording was made by Ensign
Brevelle... five years ago...
Commander Leijten, you said
Brevelle was ill last week for
several days before he...
deserted. What about Mendez?
Mendez was last seen aboard the
Aries an hour before she
disappeared. According to
witnesses, she seemed completely
normal.
And Hickman?
He just passed a routine
physical... with flying colors.
I know Paul Hickman. He's a
family man... two kids. I can't
believe he'd steal a shuttle and
desert...
Believe it, Geordi. He was
spotted by a Federation supply
ship yesterday... on a course
toward Tarchannen Three.
The original Tarchannen
disapperances were never solved,
were they?
No... we never learned what
happened or why. Forty-nine
people... gone...
And now, five years later, members
of the away team that investigated
the disappearances... have started
disappearing themselves.
Geordi and I are the only two
left.
Captain's log, Stardate 44664.5.
We have set a course to intercept
Lieutenant Hickman's stolen
shuttlecraft... and, hopefully,
to discover the whereabouts of
the other missing officers...
And then I almost married Paul
Bogrow...
Bogrow... which one was he?
You remember... with the thin
moustache...
Not Bogrow...
I know.
The one who used to drive you
crazy... you thought he was so
full of himself...
Well, I decided I prejudged him
unfairly...
Uh huh...
And then I decided I'd been right
in the first place.
Bogrow...
And what about you... how come
you never found the right girl?
I enjoy the bachelor's life too
much...
That doesn't sound like my "little
brother" who always wanted advice
on women...
Well, you were obviously a great
advisor...
What do you think, Suz?
I don't know. But I'm not ashamed
to tell you...
I'm a little scared, you know?
Yeah, I know.
Well, if anybody's gonna figure
this out, it'll be the Leitjen
and LaForge Show, right? We
always made a good team...
A helluva team...
Commander LaForge, Commander
Leijten, report to the Bridge.
We have a fix on the missing
shuttle.
On our way, Commander.
Entering the Tarchannen system,
sir.
Slow to impulse power. Mister
Worf?
Long range sensors holding on the
shuttlecraft... bearing zero one
zero, mark two seven one.
Hail the vessel.
Lieutenant Hickman is not
responding, sir.
Put a repeating message on all
sub-space channels. Make it a
Priority One communique -- order
the Lieutenant to come about and
stand to.
Still no response, sir.
The craft is now within visual
range.
On screen.
The shuttle's acceleration is
increasing... its trajectory is
moving directly into the
planet's atmosphere.
He will reach an atmospheric
interface at an altitude of two
hundred and ten kilometers.
At his current speed, he'll
self-destruct.
That is correct, Commander.
How soon, Data?
Fifty-three seconds.
Options?
He's out of transporter range.
And he's too far away for a
positive lock with the tractor
beam.
Open a channel.
Open.
Lieutenant Hickman, listen
carefully. I am Captain Picard
of the Enterprise. You are in
danger. You must slow your rate
of approach.
The shuttle is approaching the
outer thermosphere, Captain.
He's panicking...
At current rate of acceleration,
the shuttlecraft will be destroyed
in twenty-eight seconds.
Sixteen seconds to impact.
Lieutenant Hickman, you must do
as I tell you. Reduce your
velocity and bring your craft to
a positive pitch of twenty
degrees... now.
The shuttle is entering the lower
ionosphere...
Sir, sensors detect two more
Federation shuttlecraft on the
planet's surface... no life signs.
Ready an away team, Number One.
Geordi, Data, Worf...
And Commander Leijten.
Commander Leijten, LaForge, check
the shuttle... Worf, Data, you've
got the perimeter.
It's the shuttle pod Mendez stole
from the Aries...
No life signs, sir.
Sir... I am certain that we are
being watched.
Commander Riker...
Where's Commander Leijten?
Susanna, report.
Fan out. Let's find her.
Susanna?
LaForge to Leijten...
Over here...
Where have you been?
Mendez... Brevelle... they're
alive. You saw the footprints?
Yes... but they're not human...
They're here. Stand still...
listen... and you can feel it...
they're here...
I'm not picking up anything...
Where are you going?
Susanna... ?
LaForge to Enterprise, medical
emergency, two to Sickbay.
Do I look as bad as I feel?
You look fine... now.
What happened?
Your blood chemistry is way off.
And you had a histamine response,
to what I don't know.
I'll run a complete blood and
tissue analysis.
I need to get back to the surface.
Uh uh... until we find some
answers, I don't want you to leave
the Enterprise.
But I have work...
Look, Commander, you may simply
have had an anxiety reaction down
there. But we've got to make
sure.
Probably wouldn't hurt to take
it easy for a while...
I'm not going to stay locked up
on this ship while the
investigation...
Your devotion to duty is
admirable, Commander... but Doctor
Crusher is right. You will remain
on the Enterprise until we know
whether or not this is connected
to the disappearance of the
others.
Captain...
We have completed our survey on
the surface. Analyzing that data
will keep all of us busy for some
time.
Of course, sir. I understand.
Data has a preliminary report...
if you feel up to it...
Sure... what're we waiting for?
Doctor... what about LaForge?
I gave him a complete bioscan.
Everything says he's in perfect
shape.
But according to all reports...
so were Mendez and Hickman before
they disappeared.
Captain Picard's wrong. The way
to handle this is to get back down
there with a dozen away teams...
fan out from the shuttle... We
can cover a lot of ground in a
hurry... use proximity detectors
and infrared sensors...
Susanna...
Geordi... it's started...
whatever happened to the others...
it's happening to me, too...
Suz... I'm here...
I'm not going to let anything
happen to you.
Main Bridge.
During microscopic examination
of the torn uniform, I discovered
these alien skin cells.
Source?
Undetermined.
Without something else to
cross-reference, it would take
weeks to try and identify them...
Fortunately, there is more
evidence...
We have been able to determine
that the footprints we found by
the shuttle were not made by any
known Tarchannen life form.
If we're pursuing a theory that
somehow unknown aliens are
involved... I should tell you we
didn't find tracks like that
during the original investigation.
The planet is subject to frequent
sandstorms. Footprints could have
been obliterated prior to your
arrival.
Doctor Crusher and I will begin
to search the medical database...
and attempt to match these with
a known life form.
Aliens or no aliens... why would
our people start returning after
five years to be... abducted?
Some kind of compulsion... like
a post hypnotic command... ?
Something that happened while we
were down there the first time...
We can go back to the mission
record... construct a log of
everyone's movements...
And look for a commonalty.
Something we all touched... maybe
a plant... the sand...
Or something we ingested... could
be in the air itself...
The parameters are pretty broad,
Data... any match we make is going
to be inconclusive at best.
I am aware of that. However, I
see no other reasonable course
of investigation available to us.
And we may not have much time.
You're worried about Geordi,
aren't you?
I am an android. It is not
possible for me to feel anxiety.
Starfleet personnel have
vanished... others may be at risk.
We must do the best we can to find
out why.
However...
I am strongly motivated to solve
this mystery.
Freeze visual.
We're wasting our time.
You didn't feel that way before...
it was your idea to look for some
sort of commonality.
Well... I was wrong.
We're not going to find anything
this way. We should go back to
the planet... it's all down
there... everything we need to
know.
That's not an option... not until
the Captain says it is...
Computer resume.
I can't look at this anymore.
It hurts my eyes... I can't think.
My brain feels like it's wrapped
in a blanket.
Take a break. I'll work for a...
I don't need a break... I...
... I need to get off this ship.
I think... we should go see Doctor
Crusher...
Forget Crusher... forget your
logs. Tarchannen's down there,
Geordi. It's waiting for us.
That's where we should go.
Susanna... you can't leave...
Susanna...
SUSANNA!
Her blood pressure's still
falling...
Apply the T-cell stimulator.
We've got to stabilize her immune
system.
She's developed an extreme
sensitivity to light... we're
trying to make her more
comfortable.
My God...
Geordi...
Hold on, Susanna. Doctor Crusher
will help you. Just... hold on.
It's inside me, Geordi... I can't
fight it... it's winning...
Don't give up... do you hear me,
Suz? You can't give up...
This is one of Susanna's altered
skin cells...
And this is one of the alien cells
Data found.
Almost identical. How do you
explain it?
Captain, I think the people who
disappeared from Tarchannen Three
weren't abducted... they were
transformed into another
species...
Can you stop it, Doctor?
The T-cell stimulator will slow
the rate of change... but until I
find the cause...
Doctor Crusher... is this a threat
to the Enterprise?
No. I've tested the cell wall
integrity. It's viability is
extremely low. It's not possible
for Susanna to transmit it.
Then how did she get it?
That's a good question. And it
would be a great help if I knew.
The only thing I do know,
Geordi... is that it's very
possible you'll be next.
I had two full bioscans today.
You said I was fine.
I gave Susanna a bioscan, too.
I didn't find anything wrong with
her, either.
How long?
I don't know what we're dealing
with. Brevelle was sick for days
before he left... Mendez was
normal an hour before she
disappeared. You may have
weeks... or just a few hours.
Then there's no time to waste.
I've got to get back to work.
Geordi... until I know exactly
what we're dealing with, you're
staying here. In Sickbay.
Doctor, you said it would help
if you knew the source of this...
If I could finish my analysis of
the mission records... I might
find an answer.
And what if you begin to change...
and feel compelled to return to
the planet like the others?
Program the computer to monitor
my movements... that way you can
be sure I don't leave the ship.
What would you do, sir? Sit it
out in Sickbay... or try to learn
what it is that's got you... and
maybe stop it?
All right, Mister LaForge...
proceed with your investigation.
But report to Doctor Crusher for
another bioscan at the start of
day watch.
In the meantime, if you have
symptoms of any kind -- I want
to know. Immediately.
Understood.
One to transport.
I want to make another sweep of
the perimeter. Mendez, Brevelle,
start at Building Two. LaForge,
you and I will begin at Four.
Okay, computer...
Analyze audio elements from time
index fourteen four seven to
fifteen five eight. List all
anomalies.
No audio anomalies present.
Any subspace projections... z
particle emissions... or
interferometric frequencies?
No subspace projections present.
No z particle emissions present.
No interferometric patterns
present.
Geordi... may I inquire how your
investigation is proceeding?
It's not.
Have you done an audio analysis...
And a spectrographic analysis and
a screen for ionizing radiation...
and I even ran an enhancement for
micro-seismic disturbances. I've
tried it all.
I'm sorry, Data.
There is no need for an apology.
Perhaps if you indulged in a short
rest period, you could approach
this problem with what humans
commonly refer to as a fresh point
of view...
You're probably right, Data. But
I've got to finish scanning these
records... while I can.
Is there some way I can assist
you?
If I knew what I was looking
for...
I think it's just down to going
over it, Data... maybe find
something I forgot... I'll let
you know if I come up with
anything... anything at all.
Sorry to disturb you, Doctor...
It's alright. What's happened?
I thought you should see this.
Her skin's simulating the light...
a radiant reaction...
Some sort of mimetic ability?
That's not all. Her body
temperature is dropping.
It's as if she's generating a
disruptive field... I can barely
get readings off her now... What
about her rate of transformation?
It's increasing.
That's not possible. It should
have been inhibited by the
T-cell stimulator... unless...
If there's a foreign body inside
her that's producing these
changes... something like a
viral creche...
A very small one if our scans
haven't found it.
I want a full genetic analysis.
We're going to examine any
abnormality we find... no matter
how insignificant it seems.
One to transport.
Computer, delete the audio.
Wait a minute... freeze visual.
Whose shadow is that?
Please restate question.
Computer... the shadow currently
displayed in section B-eleven...
what is its source?
Unknown.
It's gotta belong to somebody...
Computer... return to time index
fourteen five eight...
Okay... Brevelle's behind the
camera... Susanna and I head off
in that direction. Mendez moves
off that way...
... so whose shadow is it?
Computer... replay visual from
last time index. No audio.
Slow to fifty percent.
Freeze visual.
Magnify four times... apply
spectral enhancement.
Computer, do you have sufficient
data to compile a Holographic
simulation of this Visual Record?
A simulation would be limited to
areas scanned by the visual
recording device.
Good. Fine. Scan the entire
record... then recreate it in
Holodeck Three.
Computer, is the Tarchannen
simulation ready?
Affirmative. Program complete.
Enter when ready.
Computer, scan Starfleet records
and create a simulation of
Brevelle... place him where he
stood while recording this...
Good. Computer, based on their
speed and direction, can you
extrapolate each officer's
movements as they walk out of
the recording device's field of
view?
Affirmative. With an increasing
probability of error, reaching
ninety-five percent after ten
seconds.
Understood. Run simulation.
I want to make another sweep of
the perimeter. Mendez, Brevelle,
start at Building Two. LaForge,
you and I will begin at Four.
It's happening too fast.
Freeze program.
Computer, reverse simulation...
run it back to... time index
fourteen five eight.
Freeze.
Computer... remove Leijten...
Remove LaForge...
... and now remove Mendez...
Computer, using vector analysis,
identify the source of this
shadow.
There is no object in the program
which could generate the shadow.
There must be something else
here... something between the
camera lights and the wall.
Computer, given the distance from
the lights to the wall... can you
determine the most likely shape
and position of the object casting
this shadow?
There is insufficient data to
reconstruct the requested object.
Okay... let's assume the height
of our friend here is about my
size... say one hundred seventy
centimeters... now can you
extrapolate its shape and
position?
Affirmative.
Do it.
There... in the thymus...
Some kind of parasite. It's using
Susanna's immune system to spread
genetic instructions...
How did it get there?
She could have been infected
during the original mission. It's
small enough to have entered
through any of the mucous
membranes...
But it certainly isn't acting like
a typical parasite... it's not
feeding off her -- it's actually
transforming her DNA to match its
own...
There's not much of her original
DNA left.
And we're going to need unaltered
genes... or we'll never get her
back. We've got to get that thing
out of her. Now.
Any luck?
Negative, Commander. Nothing in
our survey suggests the source of
a parasitic infection...
Crusher to Bridge.
Go ahead, Doctor.
The surgery was successful...
... but it will be a few hours
before we know how her
regenerative systems are
responding... In the meantime,
I'd better get Geordi in here.
Very good, Doctor. Keep us
advised.
Crusher to LaForge...
Computer, locate Commander La
Forge.
Commander LaForge is not on board
the Enterprise.
Bridge, the Computer says Geordi
isn't on board... ? Is that
correct?
I show no transporter activity.
All shuttles are secure.
Negative, Doctor. There is no
indication he left the ship.
Computer, what was Commander La
Forge's last known location?
Holodeck Three.
Worf...
Captain, if Geordi has
transformed, he may be virtually
a chameleon -- the skin develops
mimetic capabilities... he could
still be onboard...
... but undetectable to our
sensors...
Search the structure... I will
take the perimeter...
Commander...
Security...
Captain... the security lockout
on Transporter Room Six has been
broken.
Re-engage... now.
I cannot, sir... The transport
cycle has already begun.
I do not read any life signs on
the surface.
Our sensor array is useless...
we have to find another way of
locating him.
Captain, if we can get close
enough to Geordi... we can read
his absorption spectrum with an
ultraviolet light.
Can you modify an emergency beacon
to operate on UV?
Yes, sir.
Make it so. Number One, as soon
as Data is ready, I want you to
lead an away team.
How long, Mister Data?
I still must replace the emitter
module and reconnect the power
supply. It will take
approximately two minutes to
complete the modification.
Hedrick to Commander Riker.
Go ahead.
I've been able to determine La
Forge's transport coordinates.
He beamed down next to the Aries
shuttle.
Acknowledged.
He's on foot... couldn't have
gotten far by now. Let's assume
a radius of ten kilometers...
That is still a search area of
more than three hundred square
kilometers.
We've got to narrow it down.
What's happening with the enhanced
sensor arrays?
All scans are still negative.
There has to be some way to track
him.
What about the high resolution
EM scans?
We are adjusting the sensors to
read Commander LaForge's
absorption spectrum... but it
will take several hours.
Geordi doesn't have several hours.
I have completed the
modifications, Commander.
Doctor Crusher... meet us in
Transporter Room Six.
Immediately.
... And I'm going to need a
sedative for him... Get me ten
cc's of kayolane...
Doctor Crusher...
You look a lot better than you
did an hour ago...
What did you do?
We removed some kind of parasite
from your thymus...
No.
It wasn't a parasite, Doctor.
It's their method of
reproduction... to plant a DNA
strand in a living host... that
causes a metamorphosis.
... Geordi?
He's gone...
Yes...
He's on the planet...
Don't try to get up yet...
We have to find him...
An away team is about to start
a search.
You'll never be able to find
him...
I'm the only one who can.
No... you must turn them off...
the light frightens them...
What about the ultraviolet?
That is beyond their visual
spectrum... they will not run from
it.
He could be several kilometers
away by now.
No... he's here... they're all
here...
There.
Geordi...
Geordi... stop...
Wait here...
Geordi, my voice is familiar...
listen to it... you can feel that
we share this... you know I am
not a threat...
The others... Mendez, Brevelle,
they no longer exist as humans...
but a part of you still does.
You are not one of them... not
yet. I can help you... if you'll
just trust me...
I know what's going on inside
you... the war you're fighting
with yourself... the humanity
slipping away... the instinct to
run... It's overpowering, but
they know how to beat it now...
Look at me... I've come back...
Let me take you back, too.
Just take my hand... please...
Crusher to Enterprise. Lock on
to Commander Leitjen's signal...
prepare to transport two directly
to Sickbay.
We're going home, Geordi.
Is there no hope for the others?
Brevelle, Mendez...
None.
Susanna...
I'm here, Geordi. So's Doctor
Crusher and Captain Picard.
Lieutenant Commander LaForge
reporting for duty, Captain.
Welcome back, Mister LaForge.
This species... can we communicate
with them?
No. They act on instinct alone.
In another few minutes, I wouldn't
have responded to you at all,
Susanna.
Then we shall leave them be. I'll
order warning beacons placed in
orbit and on the surface.
Hopefully, no one else will have
to go through what you did.
Down there, I didn't know who you
were... and yet somehow I
believed you... trusted you...
Must've been all the good advice
I used to give you...
Thank you.
