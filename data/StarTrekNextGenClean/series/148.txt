Commander?
I'm over here, Geordi.
What's wrong?
Something jabbed me in the
calf...
O'Brien -- Commander Riker's been
injured -- lock on and bring him
up.
Stand by.
Geordi, it's just --
A scratch. Right. Sorry,
Commander, but we can't take any
chances. We're the first survey
team to set foot on this planet...
we don't know what the risks are.
What's the hold up, O'Brien?
The transporter has detected
unidentified microbes in
Commander Riker's body.
Can't the biofilters screen them
out?
Apparently not.
Doctor Pulaski has been notified.
Acknowledged.
I didn't want to leave just yet,
anyway.
Here's the biofilter's analysis
of the microbes.
Not much to go on...
I can override and beam Commander
Riker aboard...
No. I'd better go down and make
an evaluation there.
Hmm... I hope these are the right
coordinates...
Just kidding, Doctor. I know how
much you love the transporter...
About as much as I love comical
transporter chiefs...
Fill me in.
I was walking along, minding my
own business, making a simple
geological sweep... and something
stuck me in the leg.
Any pain?
No -- a little numb, that's all.
Do you know what it was that stuck
you?
We've been looking for it, but
no luck.
Well, whatever it was, it left
something behind... I'm going
to bring you up to Sickbay.
O'Brien, this is Doctor Pulaski.
Medical override is authorized.
Beam us directly to Sickbay.
Acknowledged.
I can walk to the table, thank
you.
Commander, don't start acting
heroic.
Doctor, for personal reasons, I'll
walk.
May I ask why?
I've always had the notion that
if I was ever so injured that I
couldn't make it on my own two
feet... it would be over.
Medically speaking, that's
ridiculous.
You'll get no argument from me,
but... that's how I feel.
Whoa --
This is the strangest feeling.
My whole leg just went -- dead.
Captain's log, Stardate 42976.1.
During a geological survey of
Surata Four, Commander Riker has
become infected by an unidentified
microbe.
Number One.
Captain.
Put your foot where it didn't
belong, did you?
The doctor's been getting bored
lately. I thought I'd find her
a challenge...
That you did.
The commander's nervous system
has been invaded by an unknown
microorganism. Not a bacteria,
not a virus -- but with elements
of both.
There's the point of entry...
The microbes have infected the
great sciatic nerve... they're
multiplying at an incredible
rate.
There.
Can you remove it?
Not surgically. The organisms
fuse to the nerve, intertwining
at the molecular level.
That's why the transporter's
biofilters couldn't extract them.
There's no evidence of nerve
damage, but the organisms are
impeding nervous function.
My leg's still asleep.
Your prognosis?
The infection is spreading. It
will eventually reach the brain.
And if it interfered with neural
activity there...
Commander Riker could die.
How can I help?
I need to know more about its
composition.
And for that, you need a sample.
Exactly.
Mister Data, Mister LaForge -- prepare
to beam down to the planet.
I must reiterate that it would
be better if I went alone.
Don't like my company?
Your company is not at issue.
Your vulnerability to this
microorganism is.
I'll watch where I step. Besides,
how do we know that this bug
doesn't like androids even more
than it likes humans?
Possible, but highly unlikely.
In any event, why risk both of
us?
Because I know exactly where
Commander Riker was when it
happened.
He was right over here.
I detect no animal life within
fifty kilometers. Merely
vegetation.
However, I am reading extensive
animal remains -- mostly
fossilized.
A graveyard?
I do not know.
Look at this.
The structure is rhizomatous.
Be careful.
I am always careful.
It appears to be dead.
I'm not so sure. I can see
thermal variations...
Data, set it down. Let's try
something.
Perhaps it likes humans more than
androids.
If you are correct, you are
placing yourself in grave danger.
I'm counting on those great
android reflexes of yours...
I'd say that's what we're looking
for.
I would tend to agree.
O'Brien! Stand by!
Hold it still.
Got it. Energize!
Thanks, O'Brien. Another minute,
and we'd've been fossils
ourselves.
Not precisely, Geordi. True
fossilization requires several
millennia.
Captain, here's your sample.
Get it to Sickbay right away.
Report.
Captain, the commander's injury
was not accidental. Certain vines
on the planet evidently seek out
warm-blooded beings and
deliberately infect them.
To what end?
Unknown. It is conceivable that
there is a symbiotic relationship
involved...
Go on.
There were numerous animal
remains in the area, leading me
to hypothesize that the vines
could be predatory.
Then they infect animals in order
to kill them.
It is possible.
For Commander Riker's sake, I hope
my hypothesis is in error.
Unfortunately, Mister Data, your
hypotheses rarely are.
All negative.
There's nothing that will cure
this infection?
This microorganism is very
mysterious. I can't even figure
out what's keeping it alive.
Or how to kill it.
Oh, I can kill it... but not
without destroying the nerves it's
inhabiting.
I know you're doing your best...
My best may not be good enough.
Comfortable?
How could I not be comfortable?
I'm being waited on hand and foot.
My only worry is that they'll find
out I'm faking it.
I wish you were faking it. I've
seen the thorn, Number One.
The doctor showed it to me, too.
Harmless-looking thing, isn't
it?
But deadly.
I'm sorry.
These things happen.
When you least expect them.
I'm surprised they don't happen
more often. After all, we are
exploring the unknown.
And now and then we are humbled...
reminded that the universe
contains much that is beautiful...
and much that is malevolent.
Captain, I hardly think the vine
that struck me did so out of
malice.
If I've learned anything aboard
this ship... from our voyages...
from you... it's that most life
forms act out of an instinct for
survival -- not out of evil.
A worthy lesson. I admire your
lack of rancor, Number One.
Captain, if you drop a hammer on
your foot, it's rather useless
to get mad at the hammer.
Anything?
Not yet.
Doctor, we're running out of time.
You're right. I don't need to
remind you of your duties. I
didn't mean to give offense.
None taken.
Now get out of my hair.
Aye aye, Doctor.
This bug's persistent, I'll admit.
But I'm not worried. We Rikers
are ornery, too...
In fact, my great-grandfather was
once bitten by a rattlesnake.
After three days of intense pain
-- the snake died.
You're a very entertaining
patient.
I try.
Yes. You're making quite an
effort to be cheerful.
You of all people should know...
You feel what anyone in your place
would feel.
But I'm the first officer of this
ship. I have to set an example.
Even now?
Now most of all. Deanna, facing
death is the ultimate test of
character. I don't want to die
-- but if I have to, I want to
do it with a little pride.
And a lot of impudence.
You bet. Dying is bad enough --
but losing my sense of humor?
Forget it.
Imzadi...
I haven't given up yet. The best
medical team in Starfleet is on
the case... I'm sure they'll...
It's spread to the spinal column.
It's weakening his autonomic
nervous system.
Judging by its present rate of
growth and infiltration pattern,
the infection will reach his brain
within an hour.
Medical log, Stardate 42976.2.
I can't keep the alien infection
from spreading to Commander
Riker's brain.
Once there, it will kill him by
dampening neural impulses. The
only way I can keep him alive
is to force the neurons to stay
active -- by stimulating them
directly with electrical impulses.
Let's proceed.
Good...
Stand by with five milligrams of
tricordrazine in case of seizure.
Here goes...
Tasha? Data? Geordi? Worf?!
Anybody?!
We've stimulated random wave
activity, but the patterns are
dangerously erratic.
Hang on, Will...
The wave patterns are still too
irregular.
Why won't they stabilize?
Wait -- I've found the proper
amplitude --
There. The patterns are steadier.
Is the stimulation preventing the
infection from taking hold?
For now.
The vertex waves indicate a K-complex
corresponding to an R.E.M.
state.
He's dreaming.
And if you care to enter,
Commander...
I do.
Hello!
Marvelous how easily humans do
that, sir. I still need much
practice.
There are some puzzles down on
the planet that Captain Picard
wants answered. He suggests I
take you on the away team I'll
be leading.
I shall endeavor to function
adequately, sir.
Uh, yes. And when the captain
suggested you I, uh, looked up
your record...
Yes sir, a wise procedure always.
Then, your rank of lieutenant
commander is honorary.
No, sir. Starfleet Class of '78;
honors in probability mechanics
and exobiology.
But your files... they say you're
a...
Machine? Correct, sir. Does that
trouble you?
To be honest... yes, a little.
Understood, sir. Prejudice is
very human.
Now that troubles me. Do you
consider yourself superior to us?
I am superior in many ways. But
I would gladly give it up to be
human.
Nice to meet you, Pinocchio.
A joke.
Ah! Intriguing.
You're going to be an interesting
companion, Mister Data.
All stations have reported,
Captain. There seems to be no
immediate threat to our ship or
crew.
In which case, let's hold position
for a while, Number One. This
is worth studying.
Incredible. It's like looking
off into... infinity, sir.
Remember the course in ancient
history at Starfleet Academy?
Back to the time when men still
believed the Earth was flat?
And that the sun revolved around
the Earth...
And if a ship sailed too far out
into the ocean it would fall off
the edge of the world...
"Beyond this place there be
dragons... " It was even said that
crews would threaten to hang their
captain from the yardarm if they
refused to turn back.
I'm sure no one here has that in
mind, sir.
How comforting, Number One.
But what do I say? How should
I act? What do I do?
Guinan, I need your help. Could
you sit over there?
That seems simple enough.
The first words out of your mouth
are the most important. You could
start by saying something like...
... "you're the most beautiful
woman in the galaxy."
But that might not work.
Yes it would.
If you only knew how much I wanted
to tell you that.
But you were afraid.
Yes.
Of me?
Of us. Of what we could become...
Commander Riker...
... and that you might have
thought it was a line.
Maybe I do think it's a line.
Then you think I'm not sincere?
I didn't say that. There's
nothing wrong with a line. It's
like a knock on the door.
Then you're inviting me in?
I'm not sending you away.
That's more than I expected.
But is it more than you hoped?
To hope is to recognize the
possibility. I had only dreams.
Dreams can be dangerous.
Not these dreams.
I dream of a galaxy where your
eyes are stars... And all the
universe worships night.
Careful, if you place me too high
on a pedestal, you won't be able
to reach me.
Then I'll learn to fly. You are
the heart in my day and the soul
in my night.
I don't think this is my style.
Shut up, kid.
Now, tell me more about my eyes.
He's relaxed... experiencing
feelings of warmth. Friendship.
He's reliving memories. That's
a natural side effect of the
neural stimulation.
Look at this! The organisms'
metabolism has changed. I wonder
if the stimulation is affecting
them somehow...
I'm going to refocus the impulse
pattern on the interpretative
cortex.
Will that intensify the
commander's memories?
Exactly. And we'll see if that has
an effect on the microbes...
Everyone! We've brought the
visitors!
Please enjoy what we have!
This will please you. Join us!
Another time. Thanks.
Joy and happiness!
Certainly is.
The good life, Worf.
I am not concerned with pleasure,
Commander. I am a warrior.
Even Klingons must need love now
and then.
For what we consider love, sir,
I would need a Klingon woman.
How about plain old basic sex?
You must have some need for that.
Of course. But with the females
who are available to me... Earth
females... I must restrain myself
too much. They are quite fragile,
sir.
Worf, if anyone else said that,
I'd suspect he was bragging.
"Bragging," sir?
Gentlemen, if this is what you
call "enhancement" you have a gift
for understatement.
What's your name, and tell me you
love jazz.
My name is Minuet. I love all
jazz except Dixieland.
Why not Dixieland?
Because you can't dance to it.
My girl.
What's a knockout like you doing
in a computer-generated joint like
this?
Waiting for you.
Waiting for me?!! You can't be
serious?
Oh yes, Will -- I've never been
more serious in my life.
I am going to have to leave you
for a while and see to my duties.
Your work is very important to
you.
It is me -- it's what I am.
Can we dance once before you
leave?
Sure, why not.
How did you learn to dance so
well?
From following you.
I can anticipate your lead. Tell
me more about your work -- what
is it about it that consumes and
enthralls you?
What an interesting choice of
words. That's exactly what it
does.
You are very fortunate.
I know that.
At this point in your life to be
exactly where you want to be...
And it's wonderful that you
realize it.
I'd be a fool not to know how
lucky I am to be on this ship
serving with this group of people.
It's a dream come true.
Just like this.
A dream? Is that what this is?
Is that what I am?
I know you are a computer-generated
image... but your smell,
the way you feel, your touch, even
the way you talk and think is so
real.
Thank you.
How far can this relationship go?
I mean, how real are you?
As real as you need me to be.
Something wrong?
No... it's just that... Commander
Riker's emotions are rather...
passionate.
As in -- erotic?
Very much so.
William, is something wrong?
What do you mean?
Do you not like girls?
Of course I like... Oh... is there
a technique to this foot washing?
You generally start at the top...
and work your way down.
I think I can handle that.
I was hoping you might.
I like the way your eyes pick up
the color of your tunic.
It's not our place to interfere
in the domestic affairs of other
societies.
But you can interact, can't you?
Of course. Otherwise, how can
we learn?
And that's why you're here,
tonight, with me... to learn?
Yes.
... About our society.
Yes.
In our society, it's men who are
the fortunate ones, enjoying all
that life has to offer, while we
women devote ourselves to the
obligations of making life work.
In our society we share the
responsibilities and the pleasures
equally.
Don't be defensive. I'd be the
last to imply that men are
inferior.
Or I, that women are. That's why
I can be here with you while the
women on the away team go to find
Ramsey.
I must remember to thank them when
they return for giving us this
time.
You resist... Why? Do you not
find me attractive?
Oh... Yes I find you very
attractive.
Don't you feel you know me well
enough?
You attract me like no man ever
has.
I'm flattered. I don't know what
to say.
The organisms responded, all right.
Their growth rate has doubled.
Then all we've done is make things
worse...
Now we know the organism's growth
rate is related to the memories
he's experiencing.
Or the emotions they produce.
Different mental processes
generate different chemicals.
Perhaps the organisms are
sensitive to brain endorphins.
And if some types of endorphins
attract them...
... others will repel them.
I'm going to change the
differential current pattern and
see what happens.
I am Commander William Riker of
the USS Enterprise.
I am ARMUS. You are in my space.
We mean you no harm. We have an
injured crew in that shuttlecraft.
We need to get to them. May we
pass?
You haven't given me a good enough
reason yet.
Preserving life -- all life --
is very important to us.
Why?
We believe that everything in the
Universe has a right to exist.
An interesting notion which I do
not share. You may now leave if
you wish.
We won't go without the shuttle
crew.
I warn you. You will not like
it here.
What are you saying -- that you
are going to deny us access to
our comrades?
I told you what you can do. You
can leave. I have no interest
in any further discussion or
argument.
Enough. We have people who need
attention. We will not harm you,
but we must help them.
She's dead.
Status, Doctor?
Unchanged.
Can you bring her back?
I'm trying.
You've saved people before. You
can save her.
Neural stimulator.
There. You did it.
No. I've got her on total
support. There's no independent
brain activity.
She's not responding, Doctor.
Her synaptic network is breaking
down.
No! Inject norep.
We're going for direct reticular
stimulation.
Doesn't matter! Do it!
Neurons are beginning to
depolarize.
Increase to seventy microvolts.
Doctor?
Eighty-five microvolts.
She's gone.
Gone?
There's too much synaptic damage.
That thing just sucked all the
life out of her. There's nothing
I can do...
This way.
You are going to be all right,
now.
Where are the others?
Gone. It's just us.
Commander!
There's someone there!
She's dead. If we'd only gotten
here a little sooner... !
Sir, if you indeed have "Q"'s
power...
I don't understand. Certainly
you can't bring her back to life?
I'm prevented from that by a
promise.
It's Ian. Please... please hurry.
Save him, you must save him.
What happened? Did he eat
anything? Did he fall?
No.
The child is the source of the
unusual radiation.
He said he's the reason the ship
is in danger.
That analysis is correct.
I'm losing life signs.
Oh, please. Please save him.
I'm sorry.
Captain. The containment field
has stabilized.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Then Ian was right. He was the
cause.
Apparently so.
He is a life-force entity... as
we passed each other in space he
was curious and wanted to know
about us, and he thought the best
way to learn was to go through
the process. To be born, to live
as one of us and in that way to
understand us.
Captain, he never meant any harm.
There was a moment when you
smiled.
He said thank you.
I told him we will miss him -- and
I will.
The growth rate has definitely
slowed. What is he feeling? Can
you tell?
Sadness.
Just the opposite of before --
and it's having the opposite
effect on the infection.
Then your theory is correct. The
organisms are sensitive to
different types of endorphins.
And negative emotions...
Such as sadness...
... produce endorphins that inhibit
the organisms' growth.
Then we've found a way to repel
the infection.
Assuming we're not already too
late.
How much time do we have?
I'm not sure. His vital signs
are getting weaker. I don't want
to risk another dose of
tricordrazine unless I have to...
I'm refocusing the pattern again.
We need to isolate memories that
generate stronger negative
emotions.
I am Commander William Riker of
the Starship Enterprise.
That is incorrect.
I don't understand.
You are Commander Riker, first
officer of the Klingon Cruiser
Pagh, or do you intend to
disobey Federation orders?
I have no such intentions,
Captain.
Exactly where are your loyalties,
Commander?
I'm afraid I still don't
understand.
This ship is equipped with our
best weapons and our finest
warriors. Although we are on a
peaceful mission we are prepared
to go into battle instantly.
I know I can count on every
Klingon warrior in this crew to
serve and die in that battle.
So I ask again Commander Riker,
where are your loyalties?
I have been assigned here to serve
this ship and to obey your orders.
I will do exactly that.
Will you take an oath to that
effect?
I just did.
yI-Har-Qo! nep-we' ghaH! (Do
not believe him! He lies!)
Hol-chaj yI-jatlh. (Speak in
their language.)
This is your second officer,
Lieutenant Klag.
Was there something you wanted
to say to me, Lieutenant?
Yes sir.
I don't believe you.
Then I take it you challenge my
authority over you.
Correct.
And your position in this,
Captain?
I would call it your first command
decision.
My oath is between Captain Kargan
and myself. Your only concern
is how to obey my orders.
Or do you prefer the rank of
prisoner over that of lieutenant?
I will take your orders.
And you, Commander Riker, will
obey my orders.
Agreed, Captain Kargan.
Ready for your tour, Admiral?
Quite ready, Commander.
What's in the case?
Actually... I brought this for
Doctor Crusher. But perhaps you'd
like you to see it first?
What is it?
A form of life. Discovered quite
accidentally by a survey team on
a distant uncharted planet.
Why haven't we heard anything
about that?
Oh, you'll be hearing more about
it shortly. But first there is
much scientific study to be done.
After all, this is a superior
life-form.
Superior?
Totally.
Now come, Riker. Take a good
look.
I think I'll summon our science
officer --
It won't like your science
officer. It likes you.
Now look!
Vitamins. They do wonders for
the body.
Ahh, your life is so painful now.
But soon you'll be one of us.
Riker to security. Emergency --
Touch him and he dies.
Enterprise, ARMUS has enveloped
Commander Riker.
I'm beaming you up!
If any of you leave now, he dies.
And so do the survivors of the
crash.
We've reduced the growth rate
even further... but not enough.
And his vital signs are
deteriorating.
But we've isolated the specific
areas to stimulate. The feelings
were very primal... survival
emotions.
They must be producing a type of
endorphin that's poisonous to the
organisms.
Can you intensify those emotions?
I can refocus the impulse pattern
even tighter.
But I don't know if he can
withstand it. He's extremely
weak.
Do we have a choice?
No. If we don't neutralize the
infection within half an hour,
he'll be dead.
Medical log, supplemental.
Commander Riker's condition is
still critical.
I've discovered a way to reverse
the infection's growth rate --
but I may be too late.
He's getting weaker, isn't he?
Respiration shallow, heartbeat
extremely irregular.
But we can't delay any longer...
Take us to our planet -- leave us
there with our medicine or this
person dies.
Don't you see -- I have no choice.
We were sent to bring back the
Felicium. The suffering on my
planet is too great. People are
dying. It doesn't matter any more
whether we are entitled to the
Felicium... we have to have it.
Let him go.
Take us there now -- or give us
a shuttle -- but we must have the
medicine... if you refuse, this
person dies.
I will not be coerced.
I'll do it. I'll kill him.
No you won't. You're not a
killer.
Commander Riker, those answers
make no sense.
You haven't used my first name
once, Paul.
You remember it, don't you?
You don't, because you don't even
exist. You're a fake -- an image
of the original! Aren't you?...
Answer me!
Report, Number One.
The image of Rice has been
replaced by something which is
hovering several meters away.
Prepare to beam up.
Commander.
What just happened down there?
Number One! Report!
Report! Report!
He can't answer you, Captain.
Commander Riker has been encased
in some kind of energy field.
Is he alive?
Unknown.
Who are you?
The growth rate's down to seven
percent.
But the organisms are still
impairing his neural functions.
Respiration is erratic, pulse
grossly irregular, blood pressure
almost nil.
Tricordrazine.
Can we tighten the pattern
further?
Recognize Picard, Jean-Luc,
Captain...
Recognize Riker, William T.,
Commander.
Set auto-destruct sequence.
Does the first officer concur?
... Yes. Set auto-destruct
sequence -- now!
Auto-destruct will detonate in
four minutes and fifty-nine
seconds... four minutes and
fifty-eight seconds... four
minutes and fifty-seven seconds...
Let's go. The only place we can
stop the count is from the bridge.
Thirty seconds to auto-destruct.
Captain, we are clear of the void.
You may stop the auto-destruct.
Data, on any heading -- warp six
-- now!
Captain.
I don't believe it, Number One.
It could still be part of the
illusion. Data, report.
All navigational systems confirm
-- we are at warp six -- on
course...
Seventeen... sixteen...
fifteen... fourteen...
Firing sequence proceeding, sir.
Hold fast.
Eleven... ten... nine...
six... five... four... three...
I am Korris.
We'll handle the formalities later
-- right now we have to get off this
ship. Are there any others still
alive?
No.
I believe there is a quicker way
out of here.
Let's go.
Check him Data.
He is alive -- but just barely.
Pick him up and let's get out of
here.
No. I will carry him.
As you wish.
We're out of time, Commander --
the ship's going to blow.
Transporter Room, have you got
a lock on us?
Not yet. Too much interference.
You have to get farther away from
the Engineering section.
End of the line. Transporter
Room, we've gone as far as we can.
Get us off -- now!
Ship's log, First Officer Riker.
The star has begun disintegrating.
Enterprise will be destroyed
unless it can be moved out of the
path of the star material
hurtling...
... toward us. Our only hope is
for Lieutenant Commander Data in
the time we have left, to regain
his senses and reconnect engine
power to the bridge.
Hi, Mister Data.
Nice to see you, Wesley. What... ?
Data! We need the engines on-line
in a hurry, remember?
Oh yes, I remember too.
So, Data, if you don't mind...
We've no time for courtesy!
Get those damned control chips
back in place, Data! In the
correct order!
NOW!
It's like a game of "how fast can
you do it?"
Ah, a game!
I think I can switch this to the
Main Viewer, sir...
We've got eight or nine minutes,
at most, Data. Can you finish
by then?
No. This will take slightly more
time than we have, sir.
Dammit, NO! I can't afford to
get it!
If we had just a minute more,
sir...
We didn't make it, Captain. If
we had just a minute or so more...
Yes, then reversing power leads,
back through the force
activator... repulser beam hard
against the Tsiolkovsky...
We're pushing away!
Bridge, engage engines!
The growth rate's almost zero.
That's not good enough.
Sickbay to bridge.
Go ahead, Doctor.
We've eradicated the infection.
I'm on my way.
You still here?
I could ask you the same question.
How do you feel?
Beat. You wouldn't believe the
dreams I've been having...
Yes, we would.
You'll be pleased to know that
we've terminated the infection.
Great work, Doctor.
Now, if you'll let me get out of
here and back to work...
Lie still. I have a few dozen
tests to run first.
Why? I feel fine.
There may be some residual memory
loss. I just want to make sure
you still know who you are.
Of course I know who I am. I'm
Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
USS Enterprise.
Delighted you're feeling better,
Captain.
The admiral and I were worried
about you.
Sir, I do not believe you have
the authority to promote me to
the rank of admiral.
