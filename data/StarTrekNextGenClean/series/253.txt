Acting Captain's Log,
Supplemental: The skeleton crew
left on board the Enterprise is
unable to help in the search for
Commander Data. The planet's
unusual EM field is interfering
with the ship's sensors, severely
limiting their effectiveness.
Without our sensors, we're sitting
ducks. A Borg ship could be right
on top of us before we knew it...
Ensign, we need to modify the
sensor array to filter out these
EM pulses. Can you do that?
Yes, sir.
I think so.
What's your name?
Taitt, sir.
I don't think I've seen you
before.
I was just posted here six weeks
ago.
Well, Taitt -- I'll bet you never
thought you'd be serving as
Tactical Officer after only six
weeks.
No, sir, I sure didn't.
I think I've filtered out some of
the sensor noise. I'll bring the
modifications on line.
Good work.
Riker to Enterprise.
Go ahead, Wil.
I can't contact the Captain.
It might just be the interference,
but I'd like to be sure.
Understood.
Enterprise to Captain Picard.
Crusher to Picard.
I'm not getting a Com signal from
anyone on the Captain's team.
The last time they checked-in they
were investigating a structure in
section gamma two-five.
Sir, I'm picking up a vessel
closing in on our location.
Is it a Borg ship?
It... it seems to match the
configuration of a ship The
Enterprise encountered... at
Ohniaka Three...
Red Alert. How long before
they're in weapons range?
Ahh... about... ninety seconds.
No -- no, make that seventy
seconds.
Crusher to Transporter Room Three.
Salazar here, sir.
Start transporting the Away Teams
off the surface.
Aye, sir.
Use the transporters in the cargo
bays if you have to. I want those
teams up here as fast as possible.
Armstrong, you and the others get
ready to beam up.
Beverly, Worf and I will stay here
and look for the Captain's team.
I'm not going to leave you down
there --
Pull as many people off the
surface as you can and get back to
the transwarp conduit. The
Captain's orders were to get the
Enterprise to Federation space.
Acknowledged.
Riker, out.
Prepare to leave orbit.
Sir, the Borg ship is powering up
its forward weapons array.
They'll be in firing range in...
in twenty seconds.
Salazar, how many people are still
down there?
Seventy-three, sir.
Put the Borg ship on screen.
Should I raise shields, sir?
Not yet. I want to keep bringing
people up until the last possible
second.
Ten seconds.
Stand by to raise shields and
break orbit on my mark.
Five seconds.
Mark.
Shields are down to seventy
percent.
Establish a frequency-shift firing
pattern and return fire.
Ah... right.
Direct hit... no damage.
Helm, set course for the conduit,
maximum warp.
The Borg aren't following us, sir.
Salazar, how many people did we
leave behind?
Forty-seven, sir.
Another minute and we could have
had them...
Riker to any team leader.
Lieutenant Powell here, sir.
Round up everyone who was left
behind. Take cover and try to
avoid any contact with the Borg.
Aye, sir.
Riker, out.
Even if Beverly gets back to
Federation space, it'll be a few
days before Starfleet can get any
ships here... until then, we're
on our own.
What do you think of my followers,
Picard? Impressive, aren't they?
I'm not particularly impressed.
You've simply taught them to enjoy
killing.
You are wrong, Captain. My
brother and I serve a much higher
purpose.
Data... I can sense feelings in
you.
Yes. My brother has made it
possible.
He gave you the chip -- the one
Doctor Soong made for you.
Oh, no, no. I still have the
emotional program my father
designed. I wouldn't want to give
it up. It's what has given me
such a strong sense of family --
an intense desire to re-unite with
my dear brother.
Then you're responsible for
bringing him here.
He came of his own accord. All I
had to do was lure the Enterprise
into investigating those attacks
we staged. Once the Borg told him
about my plans, I knew Data would
want to join me.
You mean... you attacked those
outposts... killed all those
people... just to get Data here
with you?
How did he do it, Data? What made
you decide to come here?
I am talking to you, Picard. I
will tell you what you need to
know.
You're controlling him. And
you've corrupted the Borg.
You simply don't understand.
You have no idea what has happened
here. How I found my true
calling... how the Borg found
something to believe in.
I'd like to learn about it. But
I want Data to tell us.
I told you -- I will tell you what
you need to know.
How do you like that, Data? He
won't even let you talk.
Do not try to drive a wedge
between us, Captain. I am loyal
to my brother.
You see, Picard? He's not your
pawn anymore. I've helped him
break free --
-- just as I've helped them.
Look at them. Look at what I've
helped them become. They're no
longer mindless automatons.
They're passionate. Alive.
Are you saying you caused them to
become individuals?
No. You and your friends did
that. All I did was clean up the
mess you made when that Borg you
befriended returned to his ship.
Hugh interfaced with the others
and transferred his sense of
individuality to them. It almost
destroyed them.
Data, do you remember when Hugh
was on the Enterprise? Do you
remember what you were like then?
That doesn't matter.
It does to me. I want to know
what's happened to Data.
What's important is what I've done
here. I've found my calling,
Picard. I know now why I was
created. And no one can ever take
that away from me.
Without me, they would have
perished. When I stumbled on
their ship, they were lost,
disoriented -- they had no idea
how to function as individuals.
They couldn't even navigate their
vessel. They had lost their sense
of purpose.
I gave them that purpose. And
they gave me mine.
The Borg aspire to the perfection
my Brother and I represent: fully
artificial life forms. We are
their future.
The reign of biological life forms
is coming to an end. You and
those like you are obsolete,
Picard.
Take them, Brother.
Still no sign of the structure.
With all this interference it
could be a hundred meters away and
we wouldn't know it.
This could take hours.
I am detecting a faint energy
reading.
Residual thermal traces... someone
stopped here...
The decay rate indicates they were
human...
They followed this path...
You must realize that something
has happened to you. The Data I
know would not be a willing party
to Lore's plan.
I now realize that my life aboard
the Enterprise was a waste. My
quest to become human was
misguided, an evolutionary step in
the wrong direction.
Data, all I'm sensing from you is
anger... hatred -- have you felt
any other emotions?
There are no other emotions.
What about love... joy?
Those are words without substance.
Love is nothing more than the
absence of hate. Joy is the
absence of fear.
Just because you haven't
experienced certain emotions
doesn't mean they don't exist..
Lore is just feeding you the
negative ones.
Counselor Troi herself told me
that feelings are not positive or
negative, it is how we act on them
that becomes good or bad.
Fine. Then what about the things
Lore is proposing? What about the
lives that have already been lost?
You do not understand. In a quest
such as ours, sacrifices must be
made. It is regrettable. But the
greater good must be served.
Give me your Visor.
Why?
Give it to me or I will take it by
force.
I am not your puppet anymore.
Sir, we've reached the coordinates
of the conduit. The tachyon
matrix is energized and ready to
go.
And Lieutenant Barnaby has
returned from the surface. He'll
be relieving me.
Right. Stand by to trigger the
conduit.
Taitt.
I'd like you to stay on the
Bridge. I'll need a Science
Officer at the Aft Station.
Yes, sir.
Helm, set a course back to the
planet.
I'm not leaving those people
stranded back there. An emergency
buoy can transmit a copy of our
log entries to Starfleet just as
easily as we can.
Ensign, prepare a buoy and launch
it when you're ready.
Aye, sir.
Lieutenant, open the conduit.
Launching the buoy now, sir.
Lieutenant, scan for any Borg
ships between here and the planet.
Sensors detect no vessels.
We have to assume the ship that
attacked us is still in orbit.
How long will we have before they
can detect us and intercept?
If their sensors function as well
as ours -- it could be as little
as thirty seconds.
Crusher to Salazar... how long
will it take to get the rest of
the crew off the surface?
One minute should do it.
We don't have one minute. How
much can you shave off that?
If I can get a good lock on them
quickly... I might be able to do
it in forty-five or fifty seconds.
We need to buy ourselves fifteen
seconds.
Is there any way we can use the
planet as a barrier... to keep the
Borg from realizing we're in
orbit?
We can enter orbit while they're
on the far side of the planet.
And if we delayed dropping out of
warp until the last possible
instant -- we could gain a few
more seconds.
If your calculations are even
slightly off... we'd hit the
atmosphere...
Then I'll have to be sure my
calculations are accurate.
Let's go for it. Helm, hard
about.
Brother!
Here is the VISOR. May I ask why
you wanted it?
I thought it might look good on
me.
What do you think?
Maybe we'd better work on your
sense of humor, Brother.
Actually, I was thinking that La
Forge's implants would make him an
ideal test subject for my
experiment.
All the Borg you have experimented
on so far have suffered extensive
brain damage.
Using the humans to perfect the
procedure would allow us to
prevent any further Borg deaths.
I understand.
What is it?
This Borg disconnected himself
from the others. He would not let
me hear his thoughts.
I've asked you all to remain
linked to Crosis at all times.
You know that, don't you?
Yes...
This is the third time he has
disabled the link since he was
brought here. He should die as an
example to the others.
No -- please --
I appreciate your vigilance,
Crosis. With you monitoring the
thoughts of the others, I can be
sure they are not falling into
confusion.
But Goval has not been with us
long. Don't you remember what it
was like when I first found you?
How bewildered you were?
I understand how difficult it is
for you. How uncertain you feel.
All these sensations are new --
and they can be frightening.
Isn't that right?
Yes. I -- have doubts...
Of course you do. That's only
natural. And no one is going to
blame you for that.
But the only way to lose those
doubts... to keep you from fear
and confusion... is for you to
stay linked with the others. So
their strength and confidence can
help you.
I need you, Goval. I need you to
help me build a future for the
Borg.
I can't do it without you. Will
you help me?
Yes... I will...
Then I need you to be strong. I
need you to be certain in your
thinking. Will you stay linked to
your brothers?
Yes. I understand now.
Lore must have told Data to take
my VISOR because he realized I
could see a carrier wave radiating
from him.
A carrier wave... is that how he's
manipulating Data?
I think what's happening is that
Lore is tapping into the chip he
stole from Doctor Soong. He's
found a way to transmit part of
that emotional program to Data.
But the only emotions Data seems
to feel are negative.
I'm sure that's intentional. But
for those emotions to affect Data,
Lore would have had to disable his
ethical program first...
Can we reactivate it?
If I could generate a phased
kedion pulse at the right
frequency, it would trigger Data's
subsystems and reboot the program.
Lore would still be feeding him
negative emotions, but at least
Data might listen to us.
I think it's worth a try.
So... got any ideas on how we can
generate a kedion pulse?
Where are you taking him?
That's not your concern.
Data, wait -- let us talk to you --
Commander, we have found it.
Hugh... ?
Why are you here, Commander Riker?
Hasn't the crew of the Enterprise
caused enough damage already?
You blame us -- for what has
happened to the Borg?
You gave me a sense of
individuality -- changed me and
sent me back to the collective.
You must have known that change
would be passed on to others.
We considered it. We knew it was
a possibility...
Then you made it possible for Lore
to dominate us.
I do not accept that. Lore is
only one man. The Borg could have
stopped him.
You don't know the condition we
were in when he found us.
Before my experience on the
Enterprise, the Borg were a singleminded
collective. The voices in
our heads were smooth and flowing.
But after I returned, the voices
began to change. They became
uneven... discordant.
For the first time, individual
Borg had differing ideas about how
to proceed.
We couldn't function. Some Borg
fought each other. Others simply
shut themselves down. Many
starved to death.
And then -- Lore came along.
You probably can't imagine what it
is like to be so lost and
frightened that you will listen to
any voice which promises change.
Even if that voice insists on
controlling you?
That's what we wanted -- someone
who could show us a way out of
confusion. Lore promised clarity
and purpose.
In the beginning, he seemed like
a savior. The promise of becoming
a superior race -- of becoming
fully artificial -- was
compelling. We gladly did
everything he asked of us.
But after a while, it became clear
that Lore had no idea how to keep
his promise. That's when he began
talking about the need for us to
make sacrifices.
And before we realized it -- this
was the result.
What's happened to them?
Lore began to experiment -- trying
to re-make us in his image.
This is the result of my encounter
with the Enterprise, Commander.
So you can see I don't
particularly welcome your presence
here.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
We came here to get our people.
I don't want to cause you any more
trouble...
Tell me... about my friend.
Friend?
The human called Geordi.
I wish I could tell you. We think
he's being held inside the
compound.
I cannot help you... I cannot risk
our being discovered.
Will you at least show us how to
get into the compound?
These caverns lead to tunnels
which run beneath the compound.
Some of them connect with the
environmental control ducts.
Show us. If we can determine the
geography of the compound, we can
form a rescue plan.
Data?
Is somebody there?
Geordi...
Captain --
Shhh. We're getting out of here.
Hurry. Data was just here; he
went to get something.
Too late.
My Brother suggested that I try to
develop my sense of humor. What
do you think?
I think it needs a little work.
What's happening?
I am neutralizing your pain
receptors.
What are you going to do to me?
I am implanting nano-cortical
fibers in your cerebrum that are
designed to learn and mimic your
neural firing patterns.
Once they are in place, I will
destroy your existing brain cells
and see if the artificial neural
network is able to take over
cognitive functions.
Data, listen to me. Lore is
controlling you -- he's
transmitting a carrier wave that's
affecting your positronic matrix.
If the procedure is successful,
your cognitive processing
functions will be considerably
improved.
Don't you care that he's
manipulating you?
However, there is approximately a
sixty percent chance that you will
not survive the procedure.
I don't much care for those odds.
They are cause for concern.
However, since I also have
Counselor Troi and Captain Picard,
the odds are that at least one of
the procedures will be successful.
Help me!
He tried to escape -- the force-field
put him into neural shock.
If he dies, Lore will blame you.
See if the corridor's empty.
Drop it or I will break his neck.
Take him.
What have you done to him?
I will be back for him later.
Geordi, are you in pain?
No. I'm a little dizzy, but
that's all.
I was able to take part of a
transceiver from the guard's
interlink system. It uses some
kind of phased pulse technology.
Is there any way we could modify
it to generate a kedion pulse and
reboot Data's program?
It's a possibility.
See if you can locate the phase
modulation circuitry.
I'll watch the door.
All right, I've found it...
Good... do you see anything that
would act as a flux inhibitor?
Sensors still can't locate the
Borg ship. I'm trying to filter
out the interference.
We'll be within transporter range
in nineteen seconds.
I'm starting to get sensor
resolution...
There's the ship.
We'll enter orbit here.
Helm, new course -- heading zero-five-two
mark seven.
Aye, sir.
Stand by to drop out of warp in...
eight seconds.
Once we're in orbit, we should
have about forty-five seconds
before they intercept us.
I hope that's enough time...
Emergency deceleration in five
seconds.
Hold on --
Report.
We're in standard orbit, sir. The
Borg ship is on the planet's far
side, and is moving to intercept.
Bridge to Transporter Rooms --
begin evacuation.
The Borg will be in weapons range
in... thirty-two seconds.
We still can't locate Captain
Picard's Team... and there's no
sign of Commander Riker or
Lieutenant Worf.
Crusher to Salazar. Report.
We're pulling the last teams off
right now. But there are six
people still unaccounted for.
Keep trying.
The Borg ship is powering up its
weapons array.
Come on, Chief. It's now or
never.
They're preparing to fire.
Raise shields.
The port nacelle's been hit.
Helm, get us out of here.
We've lost warp engines.
Evasive maneuvers, full impulse.
Shields are down to eighty
percent.
Fire phasers.
Direct hit. No damage to the Borg
ship.
Shields at seventy-three percent.
Status of the warp engines?
Still down. We can't outrun them.
Helm, set a new course -- heading
three-four-four mark six. Full
impulse.
Sir... that heading takes us
directly into the sun...
The databanks should contain
information about a process called
metaphasic shielding --
I know about that research.
Commander La Forge was developing
a program that would implement
metaphasic properties...
How far along was he?
The program's in the databanks...
but it was never tested...
If we had metaphasic shielding, we
could enter the sun's corona and
the Borg ship wouldn't be able to
follow.
Can you bring the program on line?
I can... but we have no way of
knowing if the shields will hold.
Sir, hull temperature is rising...
now at twelve-thousand degrees C.
Radiation level is nearing ten
thousand rads.
Report.
Shields at sixty-two percent...
Lieutenant, activate the
metaphasic program. We don't have
a choice.
Aye, sir.
Hull temperature is critical. We
can't withstand this heat much
longer.
The program is on line. Engaging
metaphasic shield... now.
Hull temperature dropping... down
to seven thousand degrees.
Maintain course.
The Borg ship has broken off
pursuit.
All stop.
Sir, the Borg ship is taking up
position relative to ours.
They're going to wait for us to
come out.
The question is... how long can we
survive in here?
I've done everything Geordi said.
Now to activate it...
How are we going to know whether
the pulse reboots Data's ethical
program?
We'll only be able to tell by his
behavior.
Won't he realize something has
happened to him?
I doubt it. It's one program
among thousands.
I just hope this force field has
enough energy to trigger the
pulse.
You know, Data -- I've been
thinking... about some of the
times we've had together.
Like that time we went sailing on
Devala Lake. Remember that?
I have a complete memory record of
that day.
You decided to take a swim... but
when you jumped out of the boat
you sank straight to the bottom.
I did not have enough buoyancy to
get back to the surface.
So you had to walk over a
kilometer along the bottom of the
lake to get to shore.
One kilometer, forty-six meters.
It took two weeks to get the water
out of your servos...
I am ready to irradiate your
existing brain cells.
Data... if you ever go back to
being the way you were, you may
not be able to forgive yourself
for what you're about to do to me.
I am getting some anomalous
readings from your neural net. I
will have to do further tests
before I proceed.
Someone will come and take you
back to your cell.
We can use the environmental
control ducts to get inside the
compound. They should take us to
the detention area.
We'll have to move fast. If we
have to stun a guard, the other
Borg will know right away that
he's been hurt.
When they realize... your escape
route may be compromised.
We'll have to take that chance.
Good luck, Commander.
There you are, Brother. Have you
made any progress with La Forge?
It is too early to tell if the
nano-cortical fibers have
performed their function.
I suspect none of the humans will
survive the process... but it's
their own fault, isn't it? They
should never have come here. What
were they thinking?
They came looking for me.
Humans are so sentimental.
I betrayed them. If they die...
I am responsible.
Why are you talking like this? Is
something wrong with your
programming? Perhaps I should
check your systems.
I do not want you to check my
systems. I must resolve these
issues myself.
I think I've made a mistake. I
don't believe you can tolerate the
amount of emotion I've been giving
you.
Perhaps I should cut back a
little...
How's that?
I... do not like it...
Ah. Then you prefer having more
emotions... ?
Yes...
They give you pleasure.
Yes. Please... I want more...
All right. For now, a little
more.
Thank you...
Don't mention it. I just hope
this has helped clarify things for
you.
I am concerned about my brother,
Crosis. I don't believe he really
wants to be a part of our great
future.
Sir, the metaphasic shielding is
losing integrity.
Can you stabilize it?
No... we won't be able to stay in
here more than another three or
four minutes.
Do we have warp engines yet?
The last estimate was another half
hour.
Sir?
I think I have an idea...
I think... it's possible we could
induce a solar fusion eruption...
that would destroy the Borg ship.
What?
We'd need to direct a highly
energetic particle beam onto the
sun's surface... it should
produce a superfluid gas eruption.
If we target the right spot -- the
eruption would envelop the Borg
ship.
How do you know this'll work?
I did my senior honors thesis on
solar dynamics.
Excuse me, sir, but this isn't the
Academy. And a student thesis is
a long way from a workable plan.
I've already configured the
tractor emitters to create the
particle beam... and I've located
the target point on the surface...
If her calculations are off, the
eruption could encompass us.
Well. I'll just have to make sure
my calculations are accurate.
Let's do it.
Yes, sir.
The target area on the photosphere
is destabilizing... pressure wave
expansion is accelerating...
Sub-surface fusion has been
initiated...
There's an eruption forming on the
surface.
She did it. The Borg ship has
been destroyed.
Helm, take us back to the planet,
full impulse.
You're killing him. He won't
survive another session.
I did not come for him -- I came
for you.
... It's not too late. If you
remove the fibers, Geordi might
recover.
That will not be possible.
Why? Because Lore says so?
It is for the greater good.
Good? Aren't good and bad, right
and wrong, functions of your
ethical program?
That is correct.
What does that program tell you
about what you're doing to Geordi,
about what you and Lore are doing
to the Borg?
It tells you these things are
wrong, doesn't it?
How can actions that are wrong
lead to a "greater good"?
You are attempting to confuse me.
No, Data. You're not confused;
you're sensing the truth. Your
ethical program is fighting the
negative emotions Lore is sending
you.
There you are, Captain. Thank you
for joining us. You're going to
help me in a most important
ceremony.
Where's the Captain?
Data took him away.
There's not much time.
Can he walk?
He'll need help.
There's an air duct in the
corridor that connects to a tunnel
underneath the compound. You take
Geordi and we'll look for the
Captain.
It's time to put your doubts
aside, Brother. It's time to
close the door on your past and
commit yourself to the great work
that lies ahead of us.
I need to know that I can count on
you.
As proof, I want you to kill
Captain Picard.
No... It would be wrong.
I didn't think you'd be able to do
it. You've spent too many years
among humans.
Hold him.
I've asked many sacrifices of you --
sacrifices I knew were necessary
in order to build a better future.
I want you to know that I ask no
more of you than I am prepared to
give myself. I am willing to make
the greatest sacrifice of all --
my own dear brother.
Good bye, Data.
No --
Lore...
Be careful with that, Brother.
Somebody could get hurt.
What are you doing?
I have a way out of here. I'm
willing to forget about what
happened back there and take you
with me.
We don't need anyone else. We're
Brothers.
I'll give you the chip our father
made. It contains more than just
emotions -- it has memories.
Memories our Father wanted you to
have.
I am going to deactivate you now.
Without me, you will never feel
emotion again.
You leave me no other choice.
Good bye, Lore.
I... love you... Brother...
What about Geordi and Troi?
The Enterprise is in orbit.
They've been beamed aboard.
Lore is no longer functioning.
He must be disassembled so that he
is never again a threat.
It's good to have you back, Data.
Thank you, sir.
What made you change your mind?
Perhaps my encounter with the
Enterprise affected me more than
I realized...
What will you do now?
I don't know. We can't go back to
the Borg collective...
And we no longer have a leader
here...
I'm not sure that's true.
Perhaps in time... we can learn to
function as individuals -- and
work together as a group.
Good luck, Hugh.
Good bye.
Captain's Log, Stardate 47025.4.
We have returned to Federation
Space and are en route to Starbase
two-nine-five. Mister La Forge
remains under Doctor Crusher's
care.
Enter.
Hi, Data.
I just wanted to let you know that
Doctor Crusher says I'll be able
to return to duty soon.
I am glad that the injuries I
inflicted on you are not
permanent.
What's that?
This is the chip my Father created
for me so that I could experience
emotions. I had it removed from
Lore's body before he was
dismantled.
Does it still work?
No. I am pleased to say that it
was damaged when I was forced to
fire on Lore.
Pleased? Data, you've wanted
emotions all your life.
Yes. But emotions were
responsible for what I did to you.
I would never risk letting
something like that happen again.
My friendship with you is too
important to me.
I wouldn't be much of a friend to
you if I let you give up on a life-long
dream.
Who knows? Maybe someday we can
repair this.
