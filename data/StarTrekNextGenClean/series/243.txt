We cannot leave this place.
Are you afraid to die escaping?
We are dead, Worf. We died at
Khitomer.
We were captured. It was worse
than death.
Why did you allow it to happen?
We had no choice!
We were defending an outpost on
the perimeter... the Romulans took
out our shields... their next
blast rendered us unconscious...
when we awoke... we were
prisoners... unarmed and shackled.
We were interrogated for three
months. We tried to starve
ourselves... but they kept us
alive.
The Romulan Commander -- Tokath--
thought he was being kind.
The Romulans hoped to trade our
lives for territorial concessions.
But the Klingon High Council
refused to negotiate.
They would not acknowledge their
warriors had been taken prisoner.
When it was clear that we would be
of no use to them, Tokath offered
to let us go.
But we knew that our families
believed we had fallen in battle.
We did not wish to return and
dishonor them.
We asked Tokath to let us stay.
He took pity on us.
I understand your desire to
preserve your families' honor.
But what of your own? There is no
honor in remaining prisoners.
We lost our honor when we were
captured. It does not matter what
happens to us.
All that matters is that our
families are not dishonored.
This is Starfleet... where did you
get it?
I am a Starfleet officer.
Much has changed since Khitomer.
It does not matter. The world
outside these walls no longer
exists for us. We do not speak of
it.
You should try to forget that
world as well.
Why did you come here, Worf? If
you had found your father... you
would have found only dishonor.
If he had been captured as you
were, if I had found him here...
I would be glad to see him. There
would be no room in my heart for
shame.
Much has changed since Khitomer.
I can only hope that if my son
came here... he would be Klingon
enough to kill me.
This is a Gin'tak spear.
What of it?
Have your parents taught you
nothing? This is used for battle --
not for tilling soil.
We have no need for weapons here.
The war is far away.
What war?
The war our parents came here to
escape.
That war... has been over for
years.
I'm not interested in what you
have to say, Klingon. I have work
to do.
Hello again, Worf.
They say you're going to stay here
with us.
Not by choice.
Aren't you happy to escape the
war?
The war...
Yes... we've heard the stories all
our lives. How people are
slaughtered in terrible battles...
forced to fight, whether they want
to or not. That's why our parents
came here -- to make a safe
home... a place where they could
raise their children in peace.
I should think you'd be relieved
to get away from the fighting.
You're safe here.
A place can be safe -- and still
be a prison. Where I come from,
people are free to come and go as
they choose.
So are we.
Tell your Father you would like to
leave. Tell him you want to visit
the Klingon home world. See what
he says.
Why would I want to go there?
It's dangerous.
Not any longer.
Ba'el! Come here!
Yes, mother.
You are not allowed to leave the
compound?
Then I suppose I won't be seeing
you at the pond again.
I told you not to speak with him.
I'm sorry, mother.
Enter.
I am Tokath.
I can return later if I am
disturbing you... ?
It is a strange thing when a
jailer concerns himself with his
prisoner's comfort.
Mine is a strange prison.
You robbed the Klingons of who
they were. You dishonored them.
By not slitting their throats when
we found them unconscious?
I don't expect you to understand.
You are a Romulan.
You're just like L'Kor was twenty
years ago. Proud and angry. He
hated me; all the Klingons did.
And I had no love for them -- I
won't deny it.
When I informed the High Command
that the Klingons wanted to remain
here... I was told that unless I
stayed to oversee them myself,
they would be killed.
My decision ended my military
career.
Why did you do it?
I don't expect you to understand.
You're a Klingon.
But I do expect you to understand
this: we've put aside the old
hatreds. Here, Romulans and
Klingons live in peace. I won't
allow you to destroy what we have.
Do not deceive yourself. These
people are not happy here. I see
sadness in their eyes.
That's not what I see when I look
in my wife's eyes.
I married a Klingon.
So you see, when I warn you not to
disrupt our lives here, I'm not
speaking just as a jailer... but
as a man protecting his family.
Do not test my tolerance.

Do you know what that song means?

Captain's Log, Stardate 46580.1.
The Yridian vessel Lieutenant Worf
boarded at Deep Space Nine has
failed to arrive for our scheduled
rendezvous. It is now twelve
hours overdue.
Still no sign of them on long
range scanners, sir.
Contact DS Nine -- find out what
they know about this Yridian
trader.
Hopefully he filed a flight plan
before he left the station.
That's the only chance we have of
finding Worf.
When Worf asked for leave... I had
the feeling he was hoping none of
it was true: that his father was
dead, that he hadn't been
captured.
I think part of him was hoping
that. But another part of him
wanted more than anything to find
his father.
I'm sure that's true.
But if Mogh... or any other
Klingon... had been held prisoner
for twenty years... would they
want to be found?
I have alerted the Romulan border
patrols to be on the lookout for
a Yridian ship.
If it escapes... others will learn
that we're here.
I've ordered surveillance stepped
up. If there are more intruders,
we'll stop them.
We haven't had to use one of these
in a long time.
It implants a small boridium
pellet under the skin... we can
use its energy signature to track
you.
In time, you will grow accustomed
to life here.
Never.
He is one of yours. Deal with him
however you like.
But I warn you... if he becomes a
disruption, I will not be so
tolerant.
Toq... you will guard him.
He is free to move around inside
the compound. But make certain he
does not cause trouble.
What are you doing?
The Mok'bara...
The forms clear the mind... and
center the body.
No. Like this...
This is the Mok'bara... a great
warrior called Kahless invented
the forms when he went to the
underworld in search of his
father. Kahless showed him the
forms, and his father was able to
remember his body and return to
the world of the living.
First you must learn to breathe...
stand up... as tall as you can...
Take a wider stance.
You must stop --
The forms are the basis for
Klingon combat. You would be wise
to learn them.
I will teach you. Join us.
We'll see what L'Kor thinks of
this.
Again... take your stance...
Mother?
She's not here. Come in...
This is what I wanted to show you.
I don't know why, but I'm not
supposed to look at these things.
They're Klingon, aren't they?
Yes...
I thought you might be able to
tell me about them.
This is a warrior's armor.
And this is the D'k tahg...
It should not be allowed to rust
like this...
Isn't it beautiful?
That is a Jinaq... it is given to
a daughter when she comes of age,
old enough to take a mate.
Ba'el!
Mother --
Take that off at once.
Go.
Why is she forbidden to know what
these things are?
They do not matter here. Go.
... Kahless held his father's
lifeless body in his arms. He
could not believe what his brother
had done. Then his brother threw
their father's sword into the sea,
saying that if he could not
possess it, neither would Kahless.
That was the last time the
brothers would speak.
What happened to the sword?
Kahless looked into the ocean and
wept, for the sword was all he had
left of his father... and the sea
filled with his tears and flooded
beyond the shore.
The people begged Kahless to stop
his weeping, and he did... and
walked into the water to find the
lost sword.
He searched and searched the murky
ocean bottom, holding his breath
for three days and three nights...
That is impossible!
For you, perhaps. Not for
Kahless. He was a great warrior.
You're making it up.
These are our stories. They tell
us who we are.
It is late. It is time to sleep.
Worf...
You never answered my question.
Did Kahless find his father's
sword?
Yes. He found it.
The stories you tell... are they
true?
I have studied them all my life...
and find new truths in them every
time.
Kahless... did he ever take a
mate?
That is... another story.
Tell me...
You are... Romulan.
Tokath is my father. I thought
you knew that.
How could your mother... mate with
a... Romulan?
Why shouldn't she?
It is... an obscenity.
What are you saying? They love
each other...
Romulans are treacherous...
deceitful... they are without
honor.
My father is a good man. He is
kind, and generous... there is
nothing dishonorable about him.
He was part of a cowardly attack
on Khitomer... thousands of
Klingons were massacred -- many of
them women and children.
I don't know what you're talking
about. My father came here to
escape the wars. He would never
kill anyone.
Ask him. Ask your mother. Tell
them you want to know the truth.
What is it, Number One?
We just received the Yridian's
flight plan from Deep Space Nine.
He gets around... he's been to
three different systems in the
past week -- he could have left
Worf at any of them.
Are any of these systems near
Romulan space?
Two of them. The Nequencia and
the Carraya systems.
Let's head for the closer one.
Aye, sir.
What do you want?
I... I am sorry if I upset you.
I was surprised... I became angry.
But I do not blame you. You
cannot help being what you are.
There's nothing wrong with what I
am.
What I mean is... it is not your
fault.
What? Being born? I'm sorry if
that offends you.
No, I...
It is hard to explain. Klingons
and Romulans are blood enemies --
we have been for centuries...
Not here. Here we live in peace.
But I do not live here.
Worf... before you knew... you
were attracted to me.
Can't you leave the hatred behind,
too? Can't you accept me... as I
am?
I don't know.
What have you done to her?
You are responsible. She is what
she is because of you.
Lying down with a Romulan.
Who are you to judge me?
My husband died at Khitomer. We
had left a son on the Home
World... five years old. The
first year I was here I thought I
would die from the pain of knowing
I'd never see him again.
Not a day goes by that I don't
think of him, wonder about him.
But I will never know who he is.
I gave him up -- because I loved
him too much to dishonor him.
I understand your sacrifice. And
I respect it. But to mate with a
Romulan -- this I do not
understand.
By the second year, I had stopped
weeping for my son. There were
days when I could even laugh...
and I began to look around me and
realize that this would be my
world forever.
I looked at Tokath... our captor.
I saw that he was a kind man...
and a lonely one.
And I knew that he was looking at
me, as well.
In the third year I decided to
give up hatred... and loneliness.
I am not ashamed of that decision,
and I won't be judged for it.
Leave this house. You've done
enough harm.
Ka'la!
That's not how you play this game.
The Qa'vak is not a game -- it
hones the skills of the hunt.
The hunt?
We have replicators here.
Klingons do not hunt because they
need food. The hunt is a ritual
that reminds us of where we come
from.
I know where I come from. Right
here.
It is a difficult skill to master.
Perhaps you are too young.
Throw it.
Your arm is strong. But it needs
practice. Hold your other arm
like this...
... and aim along it.
Throw.
Ka'la!
You learn quickly. Perhaps it is
time to put your skills to the
test.
What do you mean?
Come. I will teach you how to
hunt.
You're not allowed to leave the
compound.
They won't allow it.
I think they will.
Hunting? Have you lost your mind?
The boy could come with me.
I cannot sit in the compound like
an old man. I must practice my
skills.
We can't let you out. You've
already tried to escape once.
I give you my word as a warrior.
I will not try to escape.
Leave us. We have work to do.
Tokath... He gave his word.
Are you seriously suggesting we
open the gates and let him wander
free... with only a boy as his
guard?
Twenty-three years ago I gave you
my word. In all this time, have
I ever broken it?
I told you he was yours to deal
with. If you want to take this
risk, the responsibility is yours.
You will go with him. Take a
weapon. If he breaks his word and
tries to escape... kill him.
Stop!
Kahless was condemned to die by
the tyrant Molor, who was angered
that Kahless had incited the
people against him. The night
before his execution, Kahless
asked that he be allowed to go out
into the night and say farewell to
the moon and the stars... for he
knew that in the netherworld, he
would not see them again.
Kahless gave his word that he
would come back, and Molor let him
go.
That was foolish.
The next day at dawn, Kahless
returned... and was put to death.
He could have saved himself.
He had given his word. Molor
understood what that meant. Just
as L'Kor did.
Come.
He is there. But the wind has
shifted. We must wait.
Why? We're so close.
Never approach your prey from
upwind; the breeze will carry your
scent.
The wind is shifting again.
I don't smell anything.
He is there.
How can you --
Yes... I can smell it.
Remember the scent. More than
anything else, it will guide you.
It's strong. I can't believe I
couldn't smell it before.
Let it work its way into your
blood.
I can feel my heart pounding.
Yes. This is the moment where
life and death meet.
This is who we are. Warriors.
I was never taught that...
There is much you were never
taught.
Aren't you hungry, L'Kor?
Or are you upset because your
prisoner hasn't returned?
I should not have sent the boy
with him. If he's been hurt --
Don't worry, my friend. They'll
be back... after all, a warrior
keeps his word. Isn't that so?
Father... if I wanted to visit
Romulus, or the Klingon Home world --
would I be allowed to go?
Ka'la!
Tonight we eat well.
Get that off my table.
You do not kill an animal unless
you intend to eat it.
Get rid of it.
I intend to, Tokath.
But not until it's cooked.
Today I learned the ritual hunt.
But that is not all I learned. I
discovered that warrior's blood
runs in my veins.
I do not know how or why, but we
have forgotten ourselves. Our
stories are not told, our songs
are not sung.
Tonight as we came home, we sang
a song of victory -- a song known
to me only as a lullaby. But it
is a warrior's song.
Bagh Da tuHmoh... fire streaks the
heavens. ChojaH Duh rHo... battle
has begun.
Bagh Da tuHmoh. ChojaH Duh rHo.

Well, Worf... you've had quite an
effect on the young people.
I have done nothing more than show
them what they are.
No. You have shown them what you
want them to be.
Tell me this: do you know of any
place, any time in history that
Klingons and Romulans have lived
together in peace?
We have despised each other...
fought each other... for
centuries.
Except here. On this remote
planet... Romulans and Klingons
live together in harmony.
No government, no leader, has ever
done what I have done here.
It is a worthy achievement to
bring peace between enemies.
But the cost of that peace may be
too high.
Higher than endless war?
The people here have lost the
sense of who they are. They have
lost their heritage.
In what way? A few stories not
told... a few songs not sung...
not a great loss, when compared to
our living in peace.
Those are our rituals... they
define us. They tell us what we
came from... what our children
will grow to be. Without
traditions, we have no identity --
we have no pride.
Klingon pride. Is it really so
valuable? Or is it just a tired
habit...
Today Toq went with me on the
ritual hunt... I saw what happened
to him when he caught the scent of
his prey on the wind... for the
first time in his life, he felt
powerful... that's what he has
been denied by living here...
that's what you have tried to take
away from him.
For you, perhaps that is enough.
The young people may want more.
More? What more is there than
what they have here? Would you
really suggest they go into a
universe where some would hate
them -- simply because of who they
are? Those traditions and rituals
you cherish so much would not
allow them to remain friends with
Romulans.
Enough of this. We could talk all
night and not convince the other.
I offer you a choice. Live with
us... as one of us...
Or?
Or I will have you put to death.
Then that is what you will have to
do.
Worf, consider this carefully --
That death will be honorable. The
young people will see what it is
to die as a Klingon.
Enter.
Thank you.
I will remove the tracking device.
You can go over the wall and hide
in the jungle.
Why are you doing this?
My father is wrong.
No matter how I might feel about
you, you don't deserve to die.
I am not going to run away, Ba'el.
They will kill you.
Yes. But they will not defeat me.
I don't understand you.
A Klingon does not run from his
battles.
Is that really the lesson you want
us to learn?
You've taught us a great deal...
awakened something in us that we
didn't know existed...
But I don't understand what we can
learn from your death.
Then you don't yet understand what
it is to be Klingon.
Worf... in spite of everything
that's happened, I sense that you
still care for me. Am I wrong?
It's so easy for you to talk of
being a warrior... of honor and
death... is it so hard to speak of
love?
Worf... please...
I... would not have thought it
possible to love a Romulan...
But you do... ?
Yes.
If you have come that far... can't
you take the next step? Can't you
stay here with us... with me?
If there were a way... I would
take you with me...
If there's anything I've learned
from you... from your reaction to
me... it's that I have no place
out there. Other Klingons won't
accept me for what I am.
And if I stay here... these
Klingons will not accept me for
what I am.
Why did you come here? We were
happy... we didn't know there was
anything missing from our lives...
Ba'el...
Good-bye, Worf.
I know there are those among you
who may question what I'm about to
do. And you would not be wrong to
do so.
I have questioned myself... I have
spent the night considering my
decision, challenging myself to
justify whether it is right.
And I have reached the conclusion
that it is absolutely necessary to
put this man to death.
We have all shared an
extraordinary passage... from
being enemies... to becoming a
family.
Turla, you were midwife when my
daughter was born... she might
have died if it had not been for
you.
Sentith... you wrestled with a
wild morag... to save a Klingon
child.
I stood at your side when you
married, Ba'ktor.
And wept with you when she fell
ill and died.
Every one of you could tell
similar stories... of things we
have shared... in love and in
sorrow.
What we have built together...
would be destroyed by this man.
And I cannot let that happen.
I give you one last chance to
accept our way of life.
Your words are eloquent, Tokath.
But the truth is that I am being
executed because I brought
something dangerous to your young
people: knowledge.
Knowledge of their origins.
Knowledge of the real reasons you
are here in this camp. The truth
is a threat to you...
Enough.
Stand ready.
Father... please...
Raise your weapons.
Ki'tow! (Stop!)
If you kill him... you will have
to kill me, too.
Step aside, Toq.
Worf would rather die than accept
this way of life.
And so would I.
I want to leave... as do many
others. You will have to kill us
to keep us here.
You see, Tokath? It's already too
late.
I am warning you -- move aside
now.
Stand ready.
Toq. Move away...
He will listen to you. Tell
him...
He has the right to make his
choice.
Raise your weapons.
Take aim --
Ba'el...
Tokath... long ago, when your
captives asked to stay here... we
hoped not to dishonor our children
on the Home World. But perhaps,
over the years, we lost sight of
the children we raised here.
This is our prison. It should not
be theirs.
Years ago, your parents made a
great sacrifice for the sake of
their families. Today they do so
again. For that, we must honor
them.
You must promise them -- that you
will never reveal their secret.
No one must know of this place.
There's a supply ship due in a few
days. They will take us...
When they arrive, Tokath will
explain to them. We'll be able to
start a new life...
Captain's Log, Stardate 46581.5.
We have scanned the planets of the
Nequencia system and found no
evidence of a Romulan prison camp.
We are now enroute to the Carraya
system, closer to Romulan space.
Captain, we are receiving a
subspace message. It is a Romulan
signal, text only.
It is from Lieutenant Worf. He is
aboard a Romulan scout ship.
He is requesting a rendezvous.
Input the coordinates and change
course.
They seem fine. We'll be giving
them all thorough checkups in
Sickbay.
Thank you, Doctor.
Welcome home, Lieutenant.
Thank you, sir.
Picard to Bridge. Signal the
Romulan ship that we have the last
group on board.
Aye, sir.
I see you found what you were
looking for, Mister Worf.
No, sir. There was no prison
camp.
Those young people are
survivors... of a vessel that
crashed in the Carraya system four
years ago.
No one survived Khitomer.
I understand, Mister Worf.
