Come in!
Geordi... ?
I'm in here...
I've got her now, Data... she's
trapped.
Who?
Your demented cat.
I do not understand. Why is Spot
under the bed?
Probably because she knows I'll
kill her if I get my hands on her.
Has Spot been misbehaving?
That's putting it mildly. So far
she's broken a vase and a teapot,
destroyed my couch by using it as
a scratching post, and coughed up
hairballs on my carpet.
These incidents are common to cat
owners. When you borrowed Spot,
you said you wanted to experience
the full range of feline behavior
before getting a cat yourself.
Yeah, well, I don't think I'm
ready for one. You can take her
back, with my blessings.
Well? Go ahead -- call her.
Spot does not respond to verbal
commands.
She won't come when you call her?
No.
Data, have you ever considered
training her?
I have never found it to be
necessary.
Necessary? That cat is out of
control.
Half the time I wasn't sure if she
was going to lick me or scratch my
face off.
I have never experienced that kind
of behavior from Spot.
Although she does have the
unfortunate habit of jumping onto
my computer console when I am
working.
There, see? She needs training.
Riker to senior staff. Please
report to the observation lounge.
Mission briefing in ten minutes.
Okay, we have to get her out from
under there. I'll scare her --
you grab her when she comes out.
I do not think it would be wise to
startle her --
Now!
Uh-oh...
Training.
Definitely.
Captain's Log, Stardate 47310.2.
We are investigating the
disappearance of the Medical
Transport Fleming somewhere in the
Hekaras Corridor. Our search is
complicated by the unique
properties of this particular
region of space.
The Fleming's last contact with
Starfleet was four days ago. They
didn't report anything out of the
ordinary when they entered the
Corridor...
The unusually intense tetryon
fields in this sector pose a
severe navigational hazard to warpdriven
vessels...
The Hekaras Corridor is the only
route through the area which is
free of tetryon fields. Ships
travelling at warp must use the
Corridor to ensure safe passage
through the region.
How long will it take to complete
a level-one search?
At least two days, sir. The
Corridor is over twelve lightyears
long, and the surrounding
tetryon interference will limit
our sensor range.
Could we send out reconnaissance
probes to supplement the sensors?
They won't be very effective. The
interference will make it
difficult to maintain contact with
the probes; the best we can do is
to try increasing the sensor
efficiency.
We're installing multi-phase
buffers on all the sensor modules.
It should help a little.
Hekaras Two is inhabited, isn't
it? Maybe they've had contact
with the Fleming.
They haven't. I've already spoken
with the Hekaran government.
According to them, only one ship
has passed through their system in
the last week... and that was a
Ferengi trader.
The Fleming was carrying a supply
of bio-mimetic gel... it's rare
and quite valuable. Do you think
it's possible the Ferengi could
have hijacked it?
I wouldn't put it past them.
We should be prepared for that
contingency.
Agreed.
All right then. Mister Worf,
initiate your search pattern.
Let's head in.
Geordi, we have experienced a
slight drop in sensor efficiency.
Commander Riker would like us to
examine the phase buffers.
No problem, Data... I'll be with
you in a minute...
All right, Hansen, transfer EPS
conduit thirteen through the
stabilizer matrix.
Aye, sir.
Geordi, is there a problem with
the engines?
No, not really...
Then why are you stabilizing the
EPS conduit?
I'm just trying to get a slightly
higher power conversion level...
That would not affect the engines
in any way.
I know. That's not the point.
Then... what is "the point?"
I just... want the best conversion
level I can get.
Why?
It's the Intrepid.
Their Chief Engineer is Commander
Donald Kaplan. We went through
the Academy together. And... I
kind of like to make sure our
power conversion level is... a
little higher than theirs.
I understand. You are in
competition with Mister Kaplan.
No, it's not really a
competition...
This is the flagship. It just
seems to me -- we should be better
than the rest.
That does sound like a competitive
position.
It's more a matter of personal
pride. I mean... these are my
engines.
But you are trying to outperform
the Intrepid.
Well... yeah.
Computer. How much have the
conversion levels increased?
Levels are unchanged.
All right, we'll deal with of this
later...
Let's take a look at those
sensors.
Okay -- how's that?
The phase buffer is functioning
within normal parameters. Sensor
efficiency has increased six-point-seven
percent.
Only six-point-seven? One of the
stages must still be out of
alignment...
Let's check out junction A-nine.
Geordi, I have taken your
suggestion regarding Spot.
What suggestion?
I have begun to train her. I am
currently testing several
techniques.
Really...
I began with simple conditioned
response exercises and followed
with various environmental
enhancements. Next I intend to
explore bio-conditioning devices.
Devices?
Such as sensor nets for behavior
modification... or bio-feedback
motivators...
Unfortunately, I have been largely
unsuccessful...
How about a phaser? A low stun
setting at the right moment might
do the trick...
Geordi. I will not stun my cat.
I was just kidding...
This isn't it, either.
There is clearly a misalignment
somewhere in this system.
That's for sure...
There's one more possibility...
let's take a look at junction C-twelve...
I am somewhat concerned that my
training efforts will ultimately
fail...
Well, maybe you're just going
about it the wrong way.
I have consulted numerous animal
behavior manuals; several of them
claim that cats are inherently
untrainable.
I don't believe that. My sister
didn't know a thing about animals
and she was able to train her cat.
How complicated could it be?
What did she train her cat to do?
Well... her cat would jump into
her arms on command.
That is interesting. Perhaps I
could modify your sister's
technique to keep Spot off my
console. Do you know how she was
able to train her cat?
Well, as I recall, she had to walk
around for about two months with
a piece of tuna in her blouse...
I was right... this buffer is out
of alignment...
All right... how's that?
The phase alignment is
stabilizing...
However, sensor efficiency has
only increased an additional one-point-three
percent.
Well, that's not much, but every
little bit helps.
Riker to Data.
Data here.
We're picking up a ship ahead on
long range sensors. If you and
Geordi are through down there,
we'd like to have you on the
Bridge.
We've squeezed as much out of
these systems as we're going to
get.
Acknowledged, sir. We are on our
way.
We are within visual range, sir.
On screen.
This is the same Ferengi ship that
entered the Corridor a week ago.
Captain, there are no emissions
from their plasma vents. Their
warp drive must be completely
inactive.
That is correct, sir. Their
impulse systems appear to be down
as well... power generation is at
extremely low levels.
What about life signs?
Life support is also functioning,
at low levels. There are
approximately four-hundred fifty
Ferengi on board. That is a
standard complement for a vessel
of this class.
Mister Worf, open a hailing
frequency.
No response on any channel, sir.
I'm not reading any subspace
emissions from their ship at all,
sir. It looks like every one of
their field coils has been
overloaded.
That would explain why they didn't
respond to our hails...
It would also explain the failure
of their warp drive.
Sir, the Feregni sensors are still
functioning. I could modify one
of our deflector emitters to
transmit old-style delta waves...
if I modulate that with a com
signal, the Ferengi should be able
to pick it up.
Make it so.
Well, if they did hijack the
Fleming, they certainly didn't get
very far with the cargo.
Mister Worf, have tractor beams
standing by... we may have to take
them under tow...
Helm, bring us within tractor
range...
Captain, I am picking up power
emissions from the Ferengi ship...
They are locking weapons!
Raise shields --
Ready phasers. Prepare to return
fire.
Target their weapons array only.
Phasers locked.
Fire.
Direct hit.
Their weapon systems are down.
Damage report.
We sustained minimal damage on
decks five and seven, sir.
Sir, the Ferengi ship's power has
stabilized... they appear to have
impulse capability.
They were just playing dead...
conserving power until we got in
close enough.
But why attack us in the first
place?
Somehow I don't think they're
going to let us beam over and ask
them...
Mister La Forge, how are you
coming with that com link?
Almost ready, sir...
We can give it a try.
Open a channel.
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
the Enterprise. Please explain
your attack on my ship.
Our attack? We were defending
ourselves. Do you deny that you
are responsible for disabling my
vessel?
Your ship was adrift and your
communications inoperative. We
were attempting to ascertain your
status.
You were attempting to move in for
the kill.
Do not toy with me, Picard... we
are obviously at your mercy. But
know this: when the Ferengi
Council learns of your actions,
they will consider this an act of
war.
Daimon, there has clearly been a
misunderstanding here. I believe
it would be in everyone's best
interests if you came aboard and
we discussed the situation.
I see no reason to trust you,
hewman.
Then I suppose we'll be on our
way...
If you wish, I'll relay your
position to your government... in
case you're unable to complete
repairs... and remain stranded
here.
Perhaps it would be better to
discuss the situation...
We detected what appeared to be a
Federation signal buoy. When we
approached it, it emitted a
massive verteron pulse... our warp
drive, our sensors, our
communications systems were all
disabled.
We assumed we were the victims of
a new Federation weapon.
Daimon Prak. The Federation
established this Corridor to
ensure a safe route through the
sector. We have nothing to gain
from mining it.
Whatever happened to your ship may
not be an isolated incident. A
Federation Medical transport was
recently lost in the Corridor.
We passed a Federation ship
several days ago. It did not
appear to be in any distress.
Can you give us an idea of their
heading?
It's possible that information was
recorded in our sensor logs,
Commander.
Unfortunately, my entire crew is
occupied with our repairs. I
don't know if there will be time
to search our records.
Perhaps if we assigned an
engineering team to assist with
the repair efforts... would that
give you time to retrieve your
logs?
I believe it would, Captain.
Spot -- down.
Spot -- down.
Spot -- down.
This is up. Up is no.
This is down.
Down is good.
Come in.
Data. I had another idea that
might help boost our power
conversion levels. Could you give
me a hand?
I would be happy to.
Don't tell me you're training her
to use the console.
As part of her training program,
I am teaching Spot to jump down
from the desk on my command.
How's it going?
I have not been entirely
successful...
Feline supplement two-hundred
twenty-one.
That cat has definitely got a mind
of her own, Data. Maybe she's
just not trainable.
I suppose I must accept that
possibility. It may be that Spot
lacks the intelligence necessary
to learn the appropriate responses
to my commands.
Maybe.
But I think your training is
coming along quite nicely.
Come on, Data, let's go.
Okay, Data, keep the EPS flow
constant while I re-modulate the
power taps.
This procedure could only boost
the conversion level by -- point-eight
percent.
That's all right... it might be
enough.
Enough?
Commander Kaplan just sent me this
on subspace.
"La Forge. I've got Intrepid's
power conversion level up to
ninety-seven-point-one percent.
Maybe you should try cleaning your
plasma grid once in a while."
Can you believe the nerve of this
guy... ?
We perform maintenance on the
plasma grid at regular intervals.
Of course we do -- he's just
trying to get me angry.
That should do it...
Computer, what is the current
power conversion level?
Power conversion level is ninety-seven-point-two
percent.
Too bad, Mister Kaplan...
Captain's Log, Stardate, 47311.4.
Based on the Ferengi sensor logs,
we have traced the Fleming's most
likely course. It now appears
that the vessel may have come to
an unfortunate end.
What's the origin of this debris
field?
Unknown, sir. It does not appear
on any Federation charts of the
Corridor.
Could it be what's left of the
Fleming?
It is a possibility. The debris
consists primarily of duranium and
poly-composite fragments which
suggests it could be from a ship.
Furthermore, the field contains
sufficient mass to account for the
Fleming.
All right... let's take a closer
look. Perhaps we can find
something to give us a positive
identification.
Helm, plot a course through the
debris field. Ahead slow.
Captain, I am picking up a small,
metallic object, approximately
three-point-five meters in
diameter...
It could be a ship's log
recorder... or a probe casing.
I do not believe so... it is
emitting an unusual signal ...
Sir, it is beginning to generate
a verteron field.
Shields up! Full reverse, now!
Damage report.
Warp engines are off-line...
shields are down... all subspace
systems are inoperative...
Just like the Ferengi ship.
Captain, there is an unidentified
vessel heading toward us... two
life forms aboard...
On screen.
They are initiating their
Transporter systems...
Can you get any power to the
shields?
No sir.
All decks... security alert!
We are being boarded...
La Forge to Bridge... we've got
intruders in Main Engineering...
We need a security team down
here...
It's on the way...
What do you want?
We're trying to make you listen...
You are killing us.
You've made a very serious
accusation. I want you to explain
it.
Captain, according to our
research, warp fields are causing
a dangerous reaction in this
region of space.
Our planet is already being
affected. We have measured large
gravitational shifts throughout
our system.
If something isn't done, our
planet will become uninhabitable.
Captain, I've heard this theory
before. Their research was
evaluated by the Federation
Science Council a few years ago.
Their claims just didn't hold up.
That research was only
preliminary. Our original
analysis was incomplete...
Doctor, if you wanted us to review
your research, you could have
placed a request through the
Science Council.
Their resources are limited. It
would have taken over a year
before they dispatched a science
ship to come and evaluate our
work.
We were not willing to wait any
longer.
We knew that if we disabled enough
ships, Starfleet would come. Then
at least we would be able to
present our case...
That's how you rationalize these
attacks?
Neither you nor the Ferengi
suffered any casualties,
Commander. The actual damage to
your vessels was negligible.
We dispersed verteron probes in
the Corridor only to disable warpdriven
ships... nothing more.
You can call it whatever you like.
The fact remains that you
deliberately disguised your
probes. You made them look like
signal markers... You hid them in
debris fields... You mined the
Corridor.
Mister La Forge, how long do you
estimate it will take to restore
the engines?
Their verteron pulse overloaded
our field coils, sir... it'll take
at least thirty-six hours to get
underway.
I know precisely how our pulse
affected your field coils. With
my help, your ship could be
operational in ten hours...
Provided you agree to review our
research.
Because of the seriousness of your
claims, I'm willing to listen to
your case. But make no mistake.
Our priority here is the recovery
of the Fleming.
I expect you to help us restore
our systems and deactivate all
your remaining probes in the
Corridor...
If you do not, I will put you both
in the brig and take you to the
nearest Starbase where you'll face
charges for what you've done.
My sister and I have no wish to
impede your rescue efforts --
Rabal, don't. The probes are the
only leverage we have. If we --
Serova.
We will do as you ask, Captain,
but please... re-examine our data.
We will, Doctor. Part of our job
is to maintain an open mind...
even under these circumstances.
Mister La Forge, take them to
Engineering and get the core back
on-line.
Yes, sir.
Mister Data, begin a review of
their research. I'd like your
report as soon as possible.
There... shields have been
restored. You'll be able to reengage
your engines in...
approximately eight hours.
You know, even after we get the
engines on-line, it's going to
take a week to recalibrate them
properly...
I'm sorry you've been
inconvenienced.
But that's all it is -- an
inconvenience. Our concerns are
far more important than the
condition of your engines.
What if the Fleming had been
transporting perishable
supplies... or was on an emergency
mission? Your little plan might
have cost a lot of lives.
That didn't happen, Commander.
And saving lives is precisely what
we're trying to do.
Well, you have an interesting way
of going about it.
There's no point talking to you.
You've already decided not to
listen.
Commander... I know my sister can
be somewhat -- aggravating...
I'd have to agree with that...
But please try to understand...
she believes profoundly in this
cause. She has sworn to dedicate
her life to exposing the dangers
of warp drive.
Warp drive has been around for
three centuries. It's a proven
technology...
You sound like I did... about four
years ago...
You mean you didn't believe her,
either?
No. What I didn't realize... was
how brilliant my sister is. It
took two years of study for me
even to grasp the principles
behind her theoretical models...
they're that sophisticated.
Well, our Commander Data is no
slouch. If there's anything
there, he'll find it.
I hope so.
Because once we persuade Starfleet
to stop warp travel through the
Corridor... we will have to
convince our own people to give up
warp drive completely.
Hekaras Two is the only inhabited
world in this region. Without
warp drive, you'd be completely
isolated from the rest of the
Federation. Are you really
willing to take that step?
Yes. And if you were in my
position, I hope you'd be willing
to do the same.
According to Serova and Rabal's
theory, there are regions of
potential subspace instability
within the Corridor...
They believe that if these regions
continue to be exposed to warp
field energy, they will rupture --
subspace will extrude into normal
space, forming a rift.
I see. It's like pacing up and
down on a carpet... eventually,
you wear a hole in it.
The analogy is essentially
correct.
Can their theory be proven?
At this time, there is
insufficient evidence to do so...
In order to determine whether or
not a rift would form, we would
have to expose a region of the
Corridor to warp field energy
approximately one-million times
greater than that normally
generated by a starship.
Commander, we believe the warp
field effect is cumulative. Each
starship that passes through the
Corridor at warp brings us one
step closer to forming a rift.
I agree that is a possibility.
Captain, I suggest we ask the
Federation Science Council to send
a research vessel to this area.
A more detailed investigation
would resolve many of our
questions.
That's your response? More
research? More delays? I suppose
I shouldn't have expected anything
different.
Bridge to Captain Picard.
Go ahead.
Sir, we've located the Fleming on
long-range sensors, approximately
zero-point-three light years away.
What's their condition?
The vessel appears to be intact.
They have shields, but it looks
like their subspace systems are
out.
All right. We'll get underway as
soon as the engines are back on-line.
Aye, sir.
I'd like you all to put together
a research proposal for the
Science Council. I'll give it my
full recommendation.
Yes, sir.
Captain, I appreciate the
opportunity you're giving us.
It's a beginning that we --
Not "we". You can do whatever you
want, Rabal. I'll have no part of
this. It's just another delay.
The engines are back on-line, sir.
All systems are ready.
Very good.
Helm, lay in a course for the
Fleming.
Aye, sir.
It looks like they're in pretty
good condition. According to our
sensors, they've got their shields
back up to full strength.
Captain, the Hekaran ship is
moving off....
There is one life form on board.
It is Serova.
What's going on, Doctor?
I don't know...
May I speak to her, Captain?
Mister Worf, open a channel.
Serova, what are you trying to do?
They wanted proof. I'm going to
give it to them.
I'm sorry...
Captain, the Hekaran ship's
engines are beginning to
overload...
I believe Serova is attempting to
create a warp core breach...
No...
Shields at maximum... Full
reverse...
Report!
We have cleared the shock wave,
sir... but tetryon flux in the
area is increasing rapidly...
It's incredible...
Mister Data, what's your analysis?
The effect is approximately zero-point-one
light years in diameter,
and is emitting extremely high
levels of tetryon radiation...
It appears to be what Rabal and
Serova predicted, sir -- a
subspace rift.
She was right...
Can you get a fix on the Fleming?
Is it still in one piece?
Scanning...
The Fleming is near its previous
coordinates... it appears to be
intact.... but it is now within
the rift.
Doctor, is it possible for a ship
to survive in there?
Doctor...
I'm sorry about your loss... but
we need your help now.
Of course, Captain...
Does the rift pose any danger to
the Fleming?
I... I don't know...
What was that?
Some kind of high energy
distortion wave... it looks like
they're being generated from
within the rift.
As long as we maintain our current
position, our shields should
provide sufficient protection.
What about the Fleming? How long
can they survive in there?
The waves are even more intense
within the rift. I estimate their
shields will fail within twelve
hours.
Can we risk going in there to get
them out?
Not at warp, sir.
According to these readings, the
rift is in a state of accelerating
instability -- which would make it
extremely sensitive to warp field
energy. If we go in at warp, we
might make it expand even further.
I don't think we have a choice.
It would take weeks to reach them
at impulse.
Then I want some better options.
Data, Geordi... take Doctor Rabal
and begin an analysis of the rift.
We need a way to get the Fleming
out of there.
Science Officer's log, Stardate
47312.1. Our new sensor readings
have greatly improved our
understanding of the rift.
However, we have been unable to
find any way to counteract it.
Everything here supports Serova's
theories... I don't see any way to
close the rift or even reduce its
size.
Doctor, is it possible there are
areas inside the rift which are
stable... where we could safely
use our warp engines?
Perhaps...
Computer, scan the rift for
regions of low instability...
There's no area stable enough to
withstand a warp pulse...
There's something strange here...
Computer. Display grid delta-seventeen...
enhance and magnify.
What do you make of that?
It's a subspace instability --
outside the rift.
That should not be possible.
Commander, I'm going to begin a
field-enhanced scan of this
sector. I'd like to take a closer
look at this.
In the meantime, we'll have to
tell the Captain that we don't
know how to get to the Fleming.
I am not certain that is true.
I may have an idea.
I suggest we coast into the rift.
Coast?
We can initiate a brief, high-intensity
warp pulse from our
current position. We should be
able to attain sufficient velocity
to enter the rift, beam the crew
off the Fleming and exit --
without using our warp engines.
All right. Let's say we initiate
a full power warp pulse... how
much time will we have before we
drop out of warp?
If we field-saturate the nacelles,
we should be able to sustain warp
speed for approximately two
minutes.
That's not much time... and it
could get pretty rough in there.
Our timing will be critical.
Mister Data, begin your
calculations. We'll go in as soon
as you're ready.
Aye, sir.
I believe the maximum saturation
level should be eighteen-point-three
percent.
All right...
With these parameters, we should
be able to maintain warp speed
for... two minutes and eight
seconds.
I don't think we can get any more
than that.
I agree. But based on the size of
the rift, it should give us
sufficient time to complete our
rescue.
Computer. Begin nacelle field
saturation.
How did we miss it?
What do you mean?
How did we miss the connection --
between warp drive and the
formation of the rift?
Between the two of us we've logged
thousands of hours on these
engines. We're supposed to be
warp field experts. But this time
we certainly were wrong.
Technically, Geordi, we were not
wrong. Serova's theories rested
on assumptions which were
unprovable.
Seems to me she managed to prove
them pretty conclusively...
But only by using methods which a
reputable scientist would never
employ.
Yeah... she was willing to die to
make her point.
We should have listened to her
more closely.
We reviewed Serova's research to
the best of our ability, and we
were prepared to continue studying
the problem. But that was not
satisfactory.
I can remember times when I've
been a little stubborn... trying
to get people to believe me when
I didn't have enough proof...
I do not believe that you would
have resorted to such extremes.
But she had to... to make us
listen. Why? Why was I so
resistant?
Perhaps because the aggressive
methods she chose created an
adversarial situation.
Or maybe I was taking the whole
thing personally.
I do not understand...
Maybe it was all a little
threatening to me... the thought
that warp engines might be doing
some kind of damage.
I've always looked at this warp
core as something... beautiful...
It never occurred to me that it
might be -- destructive.
It's going to take another half
hour for the nacelles to saturate.
Would you call me when they're
ready?
There's someone I should talk to.
Commander.
May I join you?
I wanted to say... I'm sorry about
your sister.
Thank you.
I'm trying to tell myself that she
died for what she believed in...
but somehow that's not much
comfort.
I wish things could've happened
differently. I should have taken
a closer look at your research...
it's possible there was something
I missed...
No. You didn't miss anything.
The problem was time. It would've
taken time to do the proper
research... and Serova wasn't
willing to wait.
I guess the question now is...
where do we go from here?
I don't think we can look at space
travel the same way anymore...
we're going to have to change.
I've been in Starfleet for a long
time. We depend on warp drive...
I don't know how easy it'll be to
change.
It won't be easy at all.
Captain, warp pulse calculations
are complete. We will be firing
the engines at maximum intensity
for six-point-three seconds before
disengaging.
Damage control parties are
standing-by on all decks.
Our course to the Fleming is
plotted and laid in, sir.
Mister La Forge... whenever you're
ready...
Aye-aye, sir.
Initiating warp pulse... now.
Engines disengaged...
We are entering the rift...
Hull stress is increasing...
eighteen percent of maximum
tolerance and rising...
How long until we reach the
Fleming?
One minute, twenty-two seconds...
All transporter rooms are standing
by.
Captain, I am picking up power
emissions from the Fleming... they
may be attempting to initiate
their warp drive.
They must have been able to repair
their engines...
Captain, if they activate their
engines --
I know, Data.
Can we establish communications?
No, sir... subspace interference
is too high...
How long until we reach
transporter range?
Fifty-three seconds...
I don't think we're going to make
it...
Sir, they are activating their
warp drive...
Report!
Damage on decks six and
fourteen... our structural
integrity field is holding.
What about the Fleming?
They are badly damaged, sir...
their life support systems are
failing.
All transporter rooms, prepare for
emergency evacuation procedures...
Captain, when the Fleming
activated its warp drive, the rift
expanded by two-point-three
percent...
We no longer have sufficient
momentum to escape.
Captain, distortion wave intensity
has increased by a factor of ten.
We are within transporter range of
the Fleming, sir. Commencing
evacuation procedures...
Distortion waves are now occurring
every fifty-nine seconds... Hull
stress is nearing maximum
tolerance...
Data, what if we forced an EPS
discharge through the impulse
reactor... would that be enough
to blast us out of here?
I do not believe so, sir... and
the resulting explosion would most
likely destroy the saucer section
in the process...
Captain...
We might be able to get out of
here without using the warp
engines.
How, Geordi?
When's the last time you went
surfing, Commander?
A couple of months ago, on Risa...
I nearly killed myself on the
break at Kattala beach.
Feel like catching another wave?
A distortion wave...
Exactly, sir. If can phase-match
our deflector shield to the EM
variants of the distortion wave,
when the next one hits, we'll be
pulled along with it...
We could ride it out of the rift
and break away once we're clear.
Assuming we survive the ride.
Is everyone off the Fleming?
The last of the crew has been
beamed aboard, sir.
All right, Mister La Forge. Get
us out of here.
Yes, sir... I'm phase matching the
deflector shield now...
The next distortion wave will
impact in fourteen seconds...
Matching phases...
Prepare to engage shield emitters
on my mark...
Ten seconds...
Ready...
Engage shield emitters... full
power...
Distortion wave impact... now.
We were unable to maintain contact
with the distortion wave, sir...
we are still within the rift.
What went wrong, Mister La Forge?
The speed differential between us
and the wave was too high, sir...
the shock of the impact threw us
off.
Another distortion wave is
approaching... impact in twenty-six
seconds.
Our hull stress is already
critical... we can't handle many
more jolts like that one...
Captain, I suggest we take the
ship to full impulse. If we can
attain sufficient speed, it will
lessen the shock when the wave
hits.
Helm, full impulse. Head us out
of the rift.
Shield emitters, stand-by.
We're ready, sir.
Distortion wave impact in five
seconds...
Engage emitters... now.
We are in the distortion wave...
hull stresses exceeding
tolerance...
Structural integrity fields
failing on decks ten through
sixteen..
We are within the distortion
wave... hull stresses exceeding
tolerance...
Structural integrity fields
failing on decks ten through
sixteen... switching to
backups...
Captain, we're separating from the
distortion wave... I'm attempting
to compensate...
How much longer until we clear the
rift?
Approximately twelve seconds...
Hull stress is now one-hundred
twenty percent above maximum...
Structural breach is imminent...
We have cleared the rift. Hull
stresses have returned to normal.
Cancel red alert.
Captain's Log, Stardate 47314.5.
We have been continuing our
research, while the Federation
Council studies our reports on the
subspace rift.
It now appears certain that what
we've seen here will have
repercussions for many years to
come.
Our scans have shown a lot of
subspace instabilities all through
the sector. If they're exposed to
enough warp energy, they might
eventually create other rifts.
Based on current warp drive
patterns in the sector, we've
projected where subspace rifts
will be most likely to form in the
next forty years.
This is the way things are now...
This is how they'll look in ten
years...
Thank you, gentlemen.
We've received new directives from
the Federation Council on this
matter...
Until we can find a way to
counteract the warp field effect,
the Council feels our best course
is to slow the damage as much as
possible...
Therefore, areas of space found
susceptible to warp fields will be
restricted to essential travel
only...
And effective immediately, all
Federation vessels will be limited
to a speed of warp five, except in
cases of extreme emergency.
Sir, the Klingons will observe
these restrictions, but the
Romulans will not.
And what about the Ferengi... and
the Cardassians for that matter?
The Federation is sharing our data
with all known warp-capable
species.
All we can hope is that they
realize it's in their best
interests to take similar action.
Putting limits on warp speed is
only going to prevent other rifts
from forming. What are we going
to do about this one?
Unfortunately, right now there's
not much we can do.
My planet is not in immediate
danger, but the gravitational
shifts are already beginning to
affect its orbit. Our climate is
changing.
Starfleet is setting up a weather
control network for Hekaras Two.
It's only a temporary solution,
but it should suffice for now.
We were lucky the rift formed as
far away from the planet as it
did. At least we have a little
time to consider our options.
If there are no further questions,
you're dismissed.
We should have the thermal
stabilizers ready for the Hekarans
in another day, sir.
Very well.
But now I can't help but wonder if
all the while I was really helping
to destroy the very thing I hold
dear.
It's not going to turn out that
way, sir. We still have time to
make it better.
