			First officer's log, stardate 41986.0.
			The captain has left the ship for
			a conference and we are awaiting
			his return. It is unusual for us
			to be motionless, and a unique
			experience for everyone concerned.
			This is quite intriguing. It is
			transmitting a carrier signal on
			a frequency which has not been used
			for centuries.
			Is there a message?
			None. Just the carrier, possibly
			intended for encoded computer or
			telemetry information.
			I have never seen a space vehicle
			like it.
			Strictly speaking, it is not a
			"space vehicle." It appears to
			be a satellite, similar in its
			rudimentary design to those which
			orbited Earth in the late
			twentieth and early twenty-first
			centuries.
			Three hundred years ago.
			Then there probably aren't any
			life signs?
			None.
			The power is solar... quite
			primitive. There is however
			minimum life support.
			I wonder how it got out here.
			If it was in orbit around Earth,
			even at maximum impulse -- and
			there's no way it could travel
			any faster, it would have taken
			a dozen centuries to get here.
			At its present speed and heading,
			the vehicle will eventually enter
			the Kazis Binary system and will
			certainly be destroyed.
			Sir, I could attach a tractor beam
			and adjust its heading.
			I think not, Mister Worf. It's just
			a piece of space debris. If we
			weren't sitting here waiting for
			the captain, we wouldn't have even
			noticed it. Leave it be. Let
			nature take its course. How long
			until Captain Picard returns?
			The last communication indicated
			it would be several hours.
			Commander, request permission to
			investigate this vehicle.
			Why, Data? It's just a derelict.
			It is a piece of history. The
			opportunity to examine such an
			ancient vehicle does not come
			around very often, and as you
			pointed out, we do have the time.
			All right, Data. But be ready
			to beam back before the captain
			returns.
			Thank you, sir.
			Lieutenant Worf -- go with him.
			Aye, sir.
			Minimal oxygen atmosphere.
			An ancient solar generator,
			still operating.
			Computer -- status report.
			Computer...
			In the late twentieth century,
			computers were not voice activated,
			Worf.
			Notice the readouts -- dials,
			needle machines, gauges.
			Remarkable what they used three
			centuries ago. The on-board
			computers have ceased functioning.
			I may be able to download this old
			style disk drive back to the
			Enterprise.
			It must be sealed -- probably
			with age. I will blast it open.
			Not necessary.
			Data, this is Riker. What
			have you found?
			Very little so far.
			I have picked up the captain's
			shuttle.
			E.T.A.?
			Twelve minutes, sir.
			Alert Main Shuttle Bay.
			Aye, sir.
			The seal was broken and the
			environment has been corrupted.
			Here's another.
			This one is empty.
			It has been forced open and the
			occupant removed.
			Commander. Look at this.
			Has she been frozen for an
			extended journey?
			If that were the purpose, there
			would be evidence of a more
			sophisticated monitoring system.
			This container is designed solely
			for refrigeration.
			What is the destination?
			I do not believe they were going
			anywhere. This vehicle should
			still be in Earth orbit.
			There is no way it could break
			orbit and travel this distance
			on its own power. Not in three
			hundred years -- not in three
			thousand. Some intelligent lifeform
			must have brought it to
			this section of the galaxy.
			These crypts were opened.
			The occupants in those were taken.
			Why take some of them, destroy
			others, and leave her apparently
			untouched?
			Perhaps they learned all they
			could from the others. We may
			never know.
			The captain's shuttle is
			approaching Main Shuttle Bay.
			Enterprise, this is the captain.
			Number One, I want to get underway
			as soon as the shuttle is secure.
			Aye, sir. We will make all
			preparations.
			Commander Data, return to the
			Enterprise -- immediately.
			We have run into an unusual
			situation here. There are people
			on-board. Frozen.
			Frozen. How many?
			Three. What should I do? The
			vehicle has suffered severe
			damage. Most of the systems
			have failed.
			Are you recommending they be
			transferred to the Enterprise?
			I do not think we should leave
			them here. With your permission,
			sir, we will be returning with
			three containers.
			Whatever you do, do it quickly.
			Number One, I want a meeting on
			the Observation Deck. Mister La
			Forge, set course zero-five-eight,
			mark nine-seven-three.
			Aye -- laying in the course now.
			Captain, those coordinates will
			take us to the Neutral Zone.
			That's correct Mister LaForge, warp
			factor eight.
			Warp eight.
			Engage. Mister LaForge, you have
			the bridge.
			Two Federation outposts in Sector
			three-zero have been destroyed.
			There has been no communication
			with any Federation starbases in
			Sector three-one since stardate
			41903.2.
			Romulans.
			That is the assumption.
			There's been no direct contact
			with the Romulans since the Tomed
			Incident.
			The question is: Why here? Why
			now? What's their objective, if
			indeed they have one? For half
			a century there's barely a whisper
			about them and now for no apparent
			reason they seem to be back with
			a roar. Why?
			Almost everything we know about
			them is based on rumor and
			conjecture.
			The strategic decision is to send
			one ship.
			The Enterprise.
			Yes.
			There is a risk. We could get
			out there and find ourselves
			greatly over-matched.
			True enough -- it is a gamble.
			This first encounter... coming
			so suddenly after all this time.
			There's a very good chance it's
			a setup.
			Perhaps the Romulans are probing.
			They want to see how we react.
			Captain, we should expect
			hostilities.
			Prepare as always. If force is
			needed we will use it, but that
			will mean we have failed. Our
			goal here is to establish some
			kind of relations with the
			Romulans -- failing that -- to
			convince them of our resolve and
			to do this without resorting to
			force. Right now, the general
			feeling is that they are seeking
			a confrontation. They may want
			to test themselves in battle
			against a Federation starship to
			gauge how much we have advanced.
			Personally, I think it is
			possible they have different
			motives altogether based on needs
			which we have not identified.
			If that's the case... I must know
			it.
			Counselor -- I will need a complete
			profile on them.
			There is limited information, but
			I will prepare something.
			Data. Extrapolate for me the
			logical progression of their
			technical advancement;
			specifically, but not restricted
			to -- weapons.
			Aye, sir.
			I want this thought through
			completely. Anticipate, as much
			as you can, all the possible
			permutations.
			Computer, how long before we
			arrive at the Neutral Zone?
			Nineteen hours, twenty-eight
			minutes.
			We will reassemble in six hours.
			Let's be smart. No surprises.
			I would much rather outthink them,
			than outfight them. Questions?
			Captain.
			Doctor Crusher said she would like
			to talk with you, when you
			finished your meeting.
			Thank you.
			Doctor Crusher, this is the
			captain.
			Oh, good. Captain, could you
			possibly join me in Sickbay?
			I would not ask you if it wasn't
			important.
			I will be right there.
			Take the Conn, Number One. I
			won't be long.
			What is it, Doctor?
			It's the people from the capsule.
			Capsule? People? What people?
			The people Data beamed over.
			I wasn't aware he had.
			Well, he did and they were frozen.
			I thawed them.
			You what?
			I didn't know what else to do.
			The crypts in which they had been
			frozen were literally falling
			apart. It was either that...
			or...
			What's their condition?
			Right now they are all sleeping.
			Each of them needed minor medical
			attention... minor "now", but
			"then" their conditions were
			obviously terminal. One had a
			heart problem, another had an
			advanced case of emphysema and
			extensive liver damage. But the
			most surprising thing, is that
			each of them had been frozen after
			they died.
			After they died?
			Exactly. Cryonics. It was a
			kind of fad in the late twentieth
			century. People feared dying.
			It terrified them. At the moment
			of death, they would be frozen,
			so that later... some time in the
			future, when presumably medical
			science had a cure for whatever
			killed them, they would be thawed
			back to life, healed and sent on
			about their business.
			Well, for this group, apparently
			it worked.
			Lieutenant Commander Data, please
			report to Sickbay -- immediately.
			Permission to leave the bridge.
			Granted.
			I am never critical of any member
			of my staff being curious, but...
			the timing is just so...
			I could not leave them there,
			Captain. The condition of the
			vehicle was deteriorating.
			But, Data -- they were already
			dead. I mean... what more could
			have happened to them?
			I see your point, Captain, but
			at the time...
			You're right -- under the
			circumstances I would have done
			exactly the same.
			When they arrived... what was I
			supposed to do? Not help them?
			My question is: What do we do
			with them now?
			What are the options?
			We cannot go back and return them
			to their ship.
			We can't refreeze them.
			They are alive now, so we have
			to treat them as living human
			beings.
			Alive and well, just waiting to
			be awakened.
			I have them sedated but they
			should be up and about as soon
			as possible.
			Well...
			Then, there really is no choice.
			None that I can see.
			Before you wake them, I want
			Security here.
			Mister Worf, report to Sickbay.
			... Welcome to the twenty-fourth
			century.
			I was able to retrieve some
			information from the ancient disk
			I removed from the module's
			computer. Based on that...
			Her name is Clare Raymond, age
			thirty-five; occupation,
			homemaker... must be some kind
			of construction work.
			She died of an embolism. It
			probably happened very suddenly,
			otherwise her physical condition
			was excellent.
			His name is Ralph Offenhouse, age
			sixty-three; occupation,
			financier.
			Advanced cardiomyopathy,
			inoperable at the time, but easily
			correctable now. He must have
			known for some time his condition
			was terminal.
			Much of his file could not be
			retrieved. His name is L. Q.
			"Sonny" Clemonds. Apparently his
			occupation had something to do
			with music.
			There was marked deterioration
			of every system in his body.
			Probably due to massive chemical
			abuse. Unbelievable.
			That sounds like someone who hated
			life -- yet he had himself frozen
			so presumably he could go through
			it all again.
			Fear. Too afraid to live... too
			scared to die.
			Doctor, this seems to be a
			situation more suited to your
			talents. I will leave it in your
			hands.
			I'll be on the bridge.
			I know you have a lot of
			questions, but I would like you
			to wait. You are feeling a
			certain amount of disorientation.
			In a little while it should pass;
			then we can fully discuss what
			has happened. Nurse Wright will
			furnish you with anything you
			need.
			Not so fast. Is this part of the
			service or is it extra?
			I think it would be best if...
			I demand to know the cost of
			anything you do before the
			procedure is approved.
			I have no idea what you're talking
			about.
			Just take it slowly. Everything
			is fine. Worf, would you show
			them to the guest quarters.
			This way.
			Number One, kindly take charge
			of our guests until we have time
			to decide what we are going to do
			with them.
			Aye, sir.
			... and keep them out of my way.
			Sir?
			I know this is all very confusing
			to you so I'll attempt to
			explain. First -- you are on the
			starship -- USS Enterprise.
			American?
			No -- we are a vessel of the United
			Federation of Planets. Earth is
			a member.
			What year is this?
			By your calendar... two thousand
			three hundred sixty-four.
			What?
			My heart? Is it...
			It's perfectly fine. In fact,
			you are all now in excellent
			health.
			I made it... It worked. I never
			believed this was...
			What's that?
			An android.
			You mean a robot?
			Actually there is a distinct
			difference between a robot and
			an android.
			And him? The one I saw before
			with the... head.
			She means Worf.
			Oh, he's a Klingon, and that
			requires a little more
			explanation.
			Guys... listen. I paid some idiot
			a lot of money to freeze me when
			I died. I need to hear the
			words... Am I alive?
			Oh, yes... absolutely.
			And the liver that was about to
			explode in my face.
			Perfectly sound.
			Great...
			Excuse me. Would someone tell
			me what's going on?
			Well... About three hundred and
			seventy years ago you died of a
			massive embolism.
			I don't remember anything about
			it.
			You and the others were frozen.
			Cryonics -- you know... freeze you
			now... heal you later.
			I've heard about it; I just never
			paid it much mind. How did we
			get here?
			Why were you in a module?
			The whacko who sold me this scam
			said that by putting us in orbit
			there would be no chance of brown
			out.
			Several cryonics companies had
			fallen into disrepute because of
			power failures which adversely
			affected their refrigeration
			system. Their stocks were
			severely depressed.
			The whole deal was a long shot...
			but I figured... what the hell,
			might as well give them the dough
			instead of leaving it to my
			ex-wives.
			But you know, son, I figured it
			was just so much hooey.
			Hooey? Accessing.
			Ah, as in malarkey... jive...
			bull... hogwash... an
			intentional fabrication.
			There you go, now you got it.
			If you didn't contract for this,
			who did?
			It must have been Donald -- my
			husband. If it was new and
			foolish, he'd have popped for it.
			Well, I'll say this. It's the
			first thing he ever bought into
			that worked.
			I, for one, never had a doubt.
			My stock in this company must have
			split a dozen times by now.
			Actually the process of cryonics
			was never more than a fad, and
			did not continue much beyond the
			mid-twenty-first century.
			I need to make a phone call as
			soon as possible.
			A phone call?
			I have provided for myself. I
			have a substantial portfolio.
			It's critical I check on it. Let
			the bank know that I am alive and
			well.
			That's ah... going to be a little
			difficult right at the moment.
			Do you at least have a copy of The
			Wall Street Journal?
			I think we should take the
			doctor's advice and go slowly.
			Get adjusted to your new... ah...
			whatever, and then we'll talk to
			the captain.
			As you know, there is very little
			available on the Romulans
			Anything will help.
			They seem to be creatures of
			extremes. One moment violent
			beyond description, the next --
			tender. They're related to the
			Vulcans but as each developed,
			their differences grew wider.
			They are intensely curious. Their
			belief in their own superiority
			is beyond arrogance. For some
			reason they have exhibited a
			fascination with humans and that
			fascination, more than anything
			else, has kept the peace. One
			other thing, they will not
			initiate. They will wait for
			you to commit yourself.
			Counterpunches...
			Thank you, Counselor. This is
			quite helpful.
			I don't know about you all... but
			me -- I'm going to find the bar.
			After all of this -- I need me a
			drink.
			There is nothing of that nature
			on board the Enterprise.
			No bars?! Don't tell me that,
			son. Well, where's the
			restaurant? I'm so hungry.
			We have food stations.
			Simply tell the computer what you
			want and it will be provided.
			Where do you eat it?
			Why... here... or anywhere. We're
			not that structured.
			Now what?
			Talk.
			I'd like me a thick Kansas City
			steak - country fried potatoes
			-- a mess of greens -- and... Oh,
			hell... forget all of that. Let
			me have a martini - -straight up...
			two olives.
			... for the vitamins.
			Is there something wrong?
			Wrong? Only that your computer
			here fixed just about the best
			martini I have ever had.
			I just might get to like this
			place. Let's see if the Braves
			are on. How do you turn on this
			here teevee?
			Teevee?
			Yeah, boob-tube... you know. I'd
			like to find out how the Braves
			are doin' after all this time.
			Probably still finding ways to
			lose.
			Oh -- I think he means television,
			sir.
			Or maybe catch up on the soaps.
			That particular form of entertainment
			did not last much beyond the year
			Two Thousand Forty.
			So, what do you guys do? I mean,
			you don't drink -- no teevee -- kind
			of boring, isn't it?
			Number One.
			Riker here.
			Would you and Mister Data report
			to the bridge?
			On the way.
			With whom were you speaking?
			The captain.
			Ah... good. Tell him I would like
			to see him as soon as it's
			convenient.
			What is going to happen to us?
			Do we stay here with you? Do we
			go back to Earth?
			That will be up to the captain.
			Well, get him in here. I have
			to phone Geneva right away about
			my accounts. The interest alone
			could be enough to buy even this
			ship.
			The Yankee's right. Let's get
			the big boy in here.
			I'll pass on your request. Now,
			if you'll excuse us.
			Duty calls -- hey, I understand...
			... come back later -- you and me
			can find us a couple of
			low-mileage pit woffies, and help
			them build a memory.
			What is to be done with them?
			I don't know.
			Commander. What is a
			"low-mileage-pit-woffie"?
			This time you have me, Data. I
			haven't a clue.
			These are not like any other
			humans I have ever encountered.
			I find them fascinating.
			From what I have already seen
			of our "guests", there is very
			little to redeem them. In fact,
			it makes me wonder, how our
			species ever survived the
			twenty-first century.
			Report.
			We are six hours from the Neutral
			Zone. I have been unable to
			establish communications with any
			Federation colony or station in
			this vicinity.
			How many outposts are there in
			this sector?
			Nine.
			I think we should go on the
			presumption that they've all
			been destroyed.
			By the Romulans?
			It fits their historical pattern.
			Since there has been no contact
			with the Romulans for fifty-three
			years, seven months, eighteen
			days, we must consider that the
			information we do have, is out
			of date.
			The positive side of that is their
			information about us is also out
			of date. Captain, I believe that
			lack of information is what this
			is all about.
			Continue, Number One.
			In my opinion, the Romulans want
			a confrontation... specifically
			against us.
			The Enterprise?
			Not by name; but yes, against us.
			They know the Federation will send
			their best -- this will be a
			perfect chance for them to learn
			firsthand, how much we have
			advanced in both technology, and
			technique.
			And your recommendation.
			I don't know if I have a specific
			recommendation. Perhaps we should
			consider taking the initiative.
			I agree with Commander Riker.
			We may only have one opportunity;
			we should seize it.
			Data.
			That strategy is built on a single
			premise. The hostile intent of
			the Romulans. If the premise is
			sound, so is the proposal.
			If their intention isn't hostile,
			what is it?
			Captain Picard?
			This is the captain, to whom am
			I speaking?
			Ralph Offenhouse. Captain, I need
			to talk to you.
			What's going on here, Number One?
			Did you give him permission to
			contact me?
			No, sir. He must have seen me
			use the com panel.
			Listen, Mister Offenhouse. We
			are in a very important conference
			right now and...
			I am sick and tired of being put
			off by you and your staff. This
			is the worst run ship I have ever
			been on. You could take some
			lessons from the Q-E Two. Now
			that's an efficient operation.
			Data -- identify -- what's the
			Q-E-Two?
			It was a passenger liner which
			mostly traveled Earth's Atlantic
			Ocean during the late twentieth
			and early twenty-first centuries.
			He's comparing the Enterprise to
			a cruise ship.
			I demand you see me.
			... I think I have been very, very
			patient, especially under the
			circumstances and considering what
			I paid for this procedure, but
			frankly enough is enough. I
			demand a phone, or a radio
			whatever you have. I must contact
			my...
			...lawyers.
			I am Captain Picard.
			Excellent.
			Now, we'll be able to get some
			things straight.
			Indeed we will. Those com panels
			are for official ship business.
			If they are so important, why
			don't they need an "executive
			key"?
			Aboard a starship, that is not
			necessary. We are all capable
			of exercising self-control. You
			will refrain from using them.
			Now just a minute.
			We are involved in a
			very serious and potentially
			dangerous situation.
			I'm sure that whatever it is seems
			very important to you. My
			situation is far more critical.
			I do not think you are fully aware
			of your situation, or the time
			which has passed.
			Believe me, I'm fully cognizant
			of where I am, and when. It is
			simply that I have more to protect
			than a man in your position could
			possibly imagine. No offense,
			but a military career has never
			been considered upwardly mobile.
			I must contact my lawyer.
			Your lawyer has been dead for
			centuries.
			Yes, of course I know that, but
			he was a full partner with a very
			important firm. Rest assured the
			firm is still operating.
			That's what this is all about...
			A lot has changed in three hundred
			years. People are no longer
			obsessed with the accumulation of
			"things". We have eliminated hunger,
			want, the need for possessions.
			We have grown out of our infancy.
			You've got it wrong. It's never
			been about "possessions" - it's
			about power.
			Power to do what?
			To control your life, your
			destiny.
			That kind of control is an
			illusion.
			Really -- I'm here aren't I? I
			should be dead and I'm not.
			That's what money did for me.
			That's the kind of power I'm
			talking about.
			What is it?
			I don't know. It just started
			and I can't stop. I keep
			thinking about my boys.
			Counselor Troi, report to the
			guest lounge.
			Captain, we are approaching
			Science Station Delta Zero-Five.
			Slow to impulse... I'm on my way.
			Say, Captain -- I need to see that
			pretty Doctor of yours.
			I will inform her.
			Captain. I didn't mean to come
			on so strong. I've built my life
			on knowing what's going on. For
			the first time -- I'm completely
			out of touch -- it makes me crazy.
			Can you understand?
			It's the first thing you've said
			that I do understand. I'll see
			what I can do. But please... stay
			off the com panel.
			Counselor, get those people under
			control. We cannot afford this
			continuing distraction.
			Yes, sir.
			Hello -- my name is Deanna.
			They sent you here to settle me
			down.
			I'm the ship's counselor and I
			thought you might want to talk.
			The local shrink.
			I'm sorry, I do not know that
			term.
			It doesn't matter.
			You are feeling profoundly sad.
			Can't stop crying. I miss my
			sons, and then I think... I'm
			here, but they are gone. Donald
			-- he's my husband. I love that
			man but, good intentions aside,
			he'd mess up a free lunch. Why
			in the world he ever decided to
			do this...
			He must have thought you would
			have wanted it.
			I can tell you exactly what
			happened. He couldn't think about
			going on alone. I died, but he
			couldn't face it. So he figured
			if he had me frozen, then in his
			mind I wasn't really gone. Crazy,
			huh? But you have to know Donald.
			I'm in a world of strangers. I
			wish I knew what happened to my
			children. Did they get married,
			did they have kids...
			Let's see if we can find out.
			Computer - this is Counselor Troi.
			Request personal history on...
			What are their names?
			Tommy -- he's eight, and Eddie's
			five.
			Full names -- Date and place of
			birth.
			They were born in Secaucus -
			that's in Jersey.
			Can this really work? Can this
			tell me what happened to them?
			There has to be a record
			somewhere. There is a good chance
			we can find it.
			Whether we do or not, thank you
			for... trying.
			Date of birth. Tommy was born
			February seventeenth...
			I just got to have a little
			something to jump start the
			morning -- and a little something
			else to shut down the night.
			You have no medical need.
			It's not a question of "need,"
			darlin'. It's a matter of
			survival.
			Sorry.
			Not to worry -- ol' Watosh will
			scuffle along the best way he can.
			How do I get a hold of the ol'
			boy with the marinie face?
			I beg your pardon?
			What's his name... that android
			fella.
			Lieutenant Commander Data?
			That's the one.
			I'll let him know you want to see
			him.
			Much obliged. You sure are the
			prettiest little doctor I ever
			saw.
			Much obliged.
			Amazing. It's all right there.
			Yes, ten generations of your
			progeny.
			Everyone I ever knew is dead.
			Would you mind... I'd like to be
			alone.
			No, not at all.
			You asked to see me.
			I'm about to go out of my mind
			for something to do. Sittin'
			alone drinkin' don't get it. What
			say you and me put together a
			little party.
			A celebration?
			Naw... nothin' that fancy -- just
			some folks, some suds, and some
			sounds. Hell it ain't nothin'
			but somethin' to do. Whatdeya
			think?
			I will ask the captain.
			Great -- you do that...
			Query. You do not seem to be
			having as much difficulty
			adjusting to your current
			circumstances as are the others.
			You mean being here -- on this tub
			-- four hundred years from where
			I started? Heck -- it's the same
			dance, just a different tune.
			You think anyone 'round here's
			got a guitar I could borrow?
			No, but the computer can replicate
			such an instrument.
			I was kind of hopin' to get one
			while I still remember the chords.
			Commander Data -- we are
			approaching the Neutral Zone.
			Report to the bridge.
			I must leave.
			What's this "Neutral Zone?"
			A buffer between the Romulan
			Empire and the Federation.
			Why does that make me nervous?
			I do not know.
			We won't be inviting these
			Romulans to our party, will we?
			No, it would not be appropriate.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			have arrived at the edge of the
			Neutral Zone. We will now have
			an opportunity to learn firsthand
			what happened to our distant
			outposts.
			There is nothing left of Outpost
			Delta Zero-Five.
			It must have been one hell of an
			explosion.
			Sensors indicate no evidence of
			a conventional attack.
			There is nothing left.
			Can you determine what happened?
			The outpost was not just
			destroyed, it is as though some
			great force just scooped it
			off the face of the planet.
			Could it have been a natural
			phenomenon?
			Insufficient information.
			Geordi, set a course for the next
			closest station.
			Aye, sir.
			I just can't believe this. When
			that android fella said you could
			duplicate this baby, I didn't
			dream you'd do such a bang-up
			job... You like country?
			Excuse me?
			Picking and strummin', son. What
			about rock?
			What about rock?
			What's the matter, kid? You look
			like you're staring at a ghost.
			Well, sir, you were dead for over
			three-hundred years...
			How 'bout rhythm and blues? That
			comes back every decade or so.
			What was it like?... I mean, can
			you remember...
			What? Bein' dead? Not really,
			but then again there wasn't a
			whole lot happening.
			Why did you do it? Was there
			something left undone... something
			you have to finish?
			Nope. Just curiosity... Another
			adventure... Simply wanted to see
			what was going on.
			We are approaching Tarod Nine.
			The condition is identical,
			Captain.
			Everyone and everything is gone.
			Captain, I strongly recommend that
			we go to Red Alert. If the
			Romulans have improved their
			cloaking device, and we'd be fools
			to think they haven't, we should
			assume a more defensive posture.
			I agree, Captain. I recommend
			we go immediately to battle
			stations.
			I appreciate your concern and
			advice, but this is not the time
			for rash actions. We are still
			investigating.
			There are three other stations
			in this sector which we need to
			visit. Let's proceed in a calm
			and orderly manner.
			If not "battle stations," may I
			at least bring the ship to Yellow
			Alert?
			Yes, Number One. That would be
			prudent.
			Thank you.
			So, what is it that you want?
			I've spent my career being able
			to tell when the other guy's mouth
			is dry. There is something going
			on. Something serious. The
			tension level on this ship has
			jumped up.
			Even if you're right, what can
			we do about it? And besides,
			these old boys don't need us to
			tell them where the bear sits.
			Lookie here what that young
			fella made for me.
			How did he do that?
			He called it a pattern replication.
			It plays real good, too.
			I'm trying to tell you that there
			is a situation developing on this
			vessel which affects us, and all
			you can talk about is that stupid
			guitar!
			These folks don't need us swimming
			in their soup, so why don't you
			just relax and let them do their
			jobs?
			That may be all right for you,
			but I am not willing to allow my
			fate to be decided by others.
			I at least want to know what is
			going on.
			How are you planning to do that?
			He needs help. I think he's
			dying.
			What the hell are you doing?
			I'm going to find out what's going
			on.
			Ah... let's see.
			Ah... I want to go to a... the...
			ah...
			Where would the captain be?
			Captain Picard is located on the
			Main Bridge.
			Then, take me to the Main Bridge.
			Captain, my sensors indicate a
			disturbance. It is large and
			moving, but I cannot get a
			positive lock nor can I get it
			on the viewscreen.
			Shields up.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain, I recommend we transfer
			all power to phasers, and arm the
			photon torpedos.
			Wait. If that is a Romulan ship,
			it will read our intent. We will
			be forcing them to take a similar
			posture. We are not out here to
			engage in battles; we are explorers.
			Captain, there is sufficient
			evidence. Outposts have been
			destroyed... Countless lives have
			been lost.
			I have a positive lock... It's
			disengaging its cloaking device.
			They are vulnerable for an instant
			as they become visible.
			Captain, this may be our only
			chance.
			I've lost them.
			Are your sensors picking up
			anything? You should be
			detecting a disturbance.
			Negative.
			We wanted to know if they have
			improved their cloaking device
			-- I guess we have our answer.
			They were trying to determine
			our intent... They wanted to see
			if we would fire.
			Who the hell are they?
			Get that man off the bridge...
			now.
			I'm not going anywhere.
			Captain, they're back.
			On screen.
			Amazing. I never thought I would
			ever see a Romulan ship -- not this
			close.
			The last encounter was decades
			ago and cost thousands of lives.
			I can believe that.
			Stay calm, everyone.
			Captain, these are Romulans -- they
			are without honor. They killed
			my parents in an attack on
			Khitomer at a time when they were
			supposed to be our allies. They
			believe humans and Klingons are
			a waste of skin, so inferior as
			to be unworthy of any
			consideration.
			Lieutenant, keep your emotions
			under control. Open hailing
			frequencies.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			Romulan vessel, this is Captain
			Jean-Luc Picard of the USS
			Enterprise.
			Sensors indicate all of their
			systems are armed.
			But they have not fired.
			Let's try them again.
			Hailing frequencies are still
			open.
			Romulan vessel, this is Captain
			Jean-Luc Picard of the USS
			Enterprise.
			I am Commander Tebok.
			You have crossed the Neutral Zone.
			This is Federation territory.
			It was necessary.
			It could be viewed as an act of
			aggression.
			If our intent was aggression,
			you would not now be here.
			If we go to war, let us be sure
			it is for the right reason. We
			are here because our outposts,
			which border the Neutral Zone,
			were also attacked.
			Destroyed in the exact same manner
			as your own.
			What right did they have to enter
			Federation space?
			Silence your dog, Captain.
			Lieutenant Worf's question is
			valid.
			Even to ask such a question
			implies that we need permission;
			we do not.
			Do you think we attacked your
			outposts?
			Once we realized the level of
			destruction, we knew it could not
			have been you.
			Who is responsible?
			They haven't a clue.
			They're hoping you know, but
			they're too arrogant to ask.
			You're out of line, Mister.
			Yes, but correct in his
			assessment.
			We do not know who is
			responsible... Why entire
			outposts on both sides were
			carried off.
			I would like to offer a proposal.
			An alliance? Between the
			Romulans and the Federation?
			Nothing so grandiose -- just this.
			Cooperation... whoever or whatever
			did this is more powerful than
			either of us.
			Agreed.
			On this one issue, and only if
			it is convenient and something
			we consider appropriate at the
			time.
			Captain Picard, because your
			actions are those of a thoughtful
			man who is neither rash nor easily
			provoked, I tell you this. More
			urgent matters have caused our
			absence, and witness the results.
			Outposts destroyed, evidence of
			the Federation everywhere. We
			have been negligent, but no more.
			We have made some progress in our
			relations... let's not ruin that
			with unnecessary posturing.
			Your presence is not wanted. Do
			you understand my meaning? We
			are back!
			I think our lives just became a
			lot more complicated.
			Get him off my bridge.
			I have found something.
			I have been able to locate a
			family living outside of
			Indianapolis. The man's name is
			Thomas Raymond.
			That's my son's name. My son's
			name is Tommy.
			Computer -- let us see Thomas
			Raymond.
			Oh, my God... It's Donald...
			that's my husband.
			Actually, it's your great, great,
			great, great, great grandson.
			He's the spitting image.
			I have his address. When you get
			back to Earth, you could go and
			see him.
			But... I will still be out of
			time. A relic.
			Perhaps. But it's a place to
			start. He is after all, family.
			There's no denying that.
			Here is what I propose. You can't
			remain on the Enterprise. We have
			arranged to rendezvous with the
			USS Charleston, bound for Earth.
			You will be delivered there.
			And then what will happen to us?
			There's no trace of my money -- my
			office is gone -- what will I do?
			How will I live?
			This is the twenty-fourth century.
			Those material needs no longer
			exist.
			Then what's the challenge?
			To improve yourself... enrich
			yourself. Enjoy it, Mister Offenhouse.
			Well, one good thing -- since
			everybody's forgotten everything
			I ever did... it'll all be brand
			spankin' new. Hell, I'll be a
			bigger hit than I ever was.
			Perhaps so, anything is possible.
			What say, son -- you'd make a hell
			of a sideman.
			That offer does present a certain
			fascination.
			I have plotted a course to
			intercept the Charleston, sir,
			but they have informed me that
			they will be making an extended
			stop at Arloff Nine.
			Your point, Lieutenant?
			At warp eight, we could have
			our guests at Starbase Thirty-Nine
			Sierra in five days. It
			would cut months off their
			journey.
			They will benefit from the
			extended time. It will allow
			them to acclimate before arriving
			at Earth.
			It's a pity we can't take them
			ourselves. Having them on board
			has been like a visit from the
			past.
			That would take us in the wrong
			direction. Our mission is to go
			forward and it has just begun.
			Set velocity at warp six, Mister
			LaForge.
			Aye, sir... warp six.
			There is still much to do... and
			still so much to learn.
			Mister LaForge... Engage.
