Captain's log, Stardate 46682.4.
The Enterprise is docked at the
Remmler Array, where it will
undergo a routine procedure to
eliminate accumulated baryon
particles. In preparation for the
sweep, we are evacuating the ship.
Captain... we're still behind
schedule on decks seven and eight.
Shall I tell Arkaria Base there'll
be a delay?
No. Open up the Transporters in
Cargo Bay Two and divert everyone
from deck seven there. That
should get us back on track.
Right.
Captain... Arkaria Base does not
have the medical storage units I
requested. I have seven living
tissue samples that won't survive
the baryon sweep anymore than you
or I would. I've tried to reason
with them, but --
Have Mister LaForge transport a
stasis unit from the astrophysics
lab. You should be able to
convert it to store tissue
samples.
Thank you.
Captain... I was just heading for
deck seven. I've put the auto-shutdown
sequence on hold until we
get back on schedule.
I think we can resume the
sequence. Counselor Troi is
taking care of the situation on
deck seven.
Aye, sir.
Captain.
Mister Data.
Bridge.
It has been quite a day, has it
not?
Yes it has.
However, a change of routine is
often invigorating and can be a
welcome diversion after a long
assignment.
Exactly.
I understand that Arkaria has some
very interesting weather patterns.
Data -- are you alright?
Yes, sir. I was attempting to
fill a silent moment with non-relevant
conversation.
Small talk?
Yes, sir. I have found that
humans often make "small talk"
during awkward moments.
Therefore, I have written a new
subroutine designed for that
purpose. How did I do?
Perhaps it was a little too... non-relevant.
However, if you're
interested in small talk keep your
eye on Commander Hutchinson during
the reception this afternoon...
... he's a master.
Thank you sir, I will.
After you...
No sir. I believe you spoke
first.
We're running out of time,
gentlemen. Mister Worf?
The computer needs your
authorization to disable command
functions during the baryon sweep.
Are we ready, Mister La Forge?
Almost. I've requested some
additional field diverters for the
computer core and the Bridge and
they haven't been installed yet.
Additional units?
We've logged more warp hours in
five years than most ships do in
ten, so our baryon particle levels
are pretty high. I'm a little
worried that when the Remmler
Array starts sweeping the ship it
might have to use a stronger beam
than normal to clear out all the
radiation.
And that might overload the field
diverters protecting our key
systems. How long until the new
ones are in place?
I'd say another twenty minutes.
Very well.
Computer, disable all command
functions in thirty minutes.
Authorization: Picard gamma-six-zero-seven-three.
Authorization acknowledged.
Incoming message, Captain. It's
the station administrator, Mister
Orton.
In my Ready Room.
Sir. Request permission to be
excused from Commander
Hutchinson's... reception.
Permission granted. I only wish
I could excuse myself as well.
Captain, permission to --
Sorry, Mister LaForge... I can't
excuse the entire senior staff.
Worf beat you to it.
Go ahead, Mister Orton.
Captain, if you're on schedule,
I'd like to confirm that we'll
begin the baryon sweep at fifteen
hundred hours -- approximately one
hour from now.
Confirmed.
Commander Hutchinson also wanted
me to make sure that you'll be
able to attend his reception this
afternoon.
Tell him... I'm looking forward to
it.
He'll be delighted to hear that.
Arkaria Base out.
Tell Arkaria base that we're
almost finished here...
We're going to need two more
conduits...
I need to run a diagnostic on the
diverter...
Get the diverter aligned so that
we can begin the isolation
procedure.
Where's the ODN interface?
Beverly!
Lovely as ever... how do you
manage it?
It's good to see you again.
It's been far too long -- what is
it, four years? Now I want to
hear all about what happened after
you left Starfleet Medical. And
I have so much to tell you.
Oh, that must be Commander Riker.
Excuse me, won't you?
Of course.
You must be Wil Riker.
I guess I must.
Calvin Hutchinson -- call me
Hutch. Calvin -- awful name, I've
never forgiven my parents. As
soon as I saw you, I knew you had
to be the Enterprise's first
officer.
Oh?
Of course. Your reputation
proceeds you -- flashing blue
eyes, square jaw... quite the
ladies man I hear. Now don't be
modest, Wil -- may I call you Wil?
Uh, sure.
I've also heard that you're a
musician. I hope you'll play
something for us. It's not often
that I get a chance to entertain
the command crew of the
flagship... and speaking of
command, hello Captain Picard.
Commander.
I was just telling your first
officer what a real pleasure it is
to have you all...
It is very good to see you both
again. May I call you Beverly? --
Beverly, do you find the mean
temperature here on Arkaria to be
slightly above normal for human
comfort levels?
I have found that most humans
prefer a temperature of twenty-one
degrees C in order to operate most
efficiently. However, there are
some cultures which actually...
... I tell you, you've never seen
anything like it. There were
thousands of these creatures...
the whole northern sky turned
dark.
Geordi! Deanna! I don't believe
you've met our host.
Allow me to introduce Commander
Geordi La Forge, Counselor Deanna
Troi. This is Commander
Hutchinson.
Hutch.
Hello.
Hello.
I was just telling your captain
about some of the fascinating
sights here on Arkaria. Is either
of you interested in ornithology?
Uh... well...
The mating habits of the Arkarian
horn fowl are quite interesting.
If the weather were better, we
could take horses to the southern
promontory and visit the nesting
grounds.
Horses?
Yes... there's a network of trails
through the plains.
Unfortunately, they aren't very
pleasant right now... muddy, cold.
Not a soul for kilometers.
That sounds... perfect.
How long until the baryon sweep
begins on the Enterprise?
At least twenty-five minutes.
Then I'll have time to get my
saddle.
Your... saddle?
Yes.
A saddle is a very personal thing.
It has to be broken in... worn...
cared for...
You keep a saddle... on the
Enterprise?
Yes.
I've had it since the Academy.
I never know when I'll have the
opportunity to ride.
I see.
It's perfectly normal. Most
serious riders have their own
saddles.
Of course.
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
If you'll excuse me.
An amazing man. He reminds me of
another officer I knew many years
ago... a Captain Edwell. Now he
was fascinating... born on Gaspra
Seven but you wouldn't know it
from the way he looked...
Auto-shutdown sequence in
progress. Defensive systems off-line.
Baryon sweep begins in
eight minutes.
What are you doing?
Somone left this ODN junction box
open.
I thought your crew was supposed
to leave the ship once the field
diverters were in place.
The diverters have to be
synchronized.
I was laser-bonding a backup link.
I see. Well, I suppose I'd better
let you finish up so you can get
off the ship.
Wait a minute --
Auto shut-down sequence in
progress. Inertial dampers off-line.
Baryon sweep begins in six
minutes.
Auto shut-down sequence in
progress. Life support off-line.
Baryon sweep begins in three
minutes.
We still have to by-pass the
magnetic containment conduit.
That should be down on deck
thirty.
Get Pomet started on it right
away.
Auto shut-down sequence in
progress. Primary power off-line
in one minute.
Primary power off-line in thirty
seconds.
Final warning. Primary power off-line
in ten seconds...
I find it fascinating that your
family chose to drop the prefix
"Pel" from your surname. It was
my understanding that "Pel Orton"
would be considered a more noble
appellation on Arkaria than simply
Orton.
Yes.
Perhaps the recent Arkarian trend
toward a more egalitarian society
is partly responsible.
Perhaps.
The crew of the Magellan actually
put on a talent show here.
Captain Conklin did a poetry
reading, if you can imagine that.
I'm trying to.
Did I ever tell you how I came to
be stationed here? It's a
fascinating story.
You see, I was serving on Admiral
Mitchell's staff on Starbase
ninety-seven -- awful place, by
the way --
Hutch. Have you met our Commander
Data?
Why no, I don't think so.
... there are several cultures in
this sector with remarkably
similar etymological histories --
Data, allow me to introduce our
host. This is Commander
Hutchinson -- call him Hutch.
This is our second officer,
Commander Data.
A pleasure.
The pleasure is mine. I have been
meaning to compliment you on your
choice of colors here.
You really think so? It wasn't
easy to make the final decision,
let me tell you.
I am sure of that. The light in
this room makes color selection
exceptionally problematic.
Precisely.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm not sure which one to feel
sorry for.
Mister Orton?
If you'll excuse me, Commander.
Geordi... what happened to the
Captain?
He went back to the ship to get
his saddle.
His saddle?
Any serious rider would have his
own saddle.
Oh.
He probably went right to the
stables. I bet he's ten
kilometers from here already.
Lucky him.
Kelsey to Devor.
Devor, this is Kelsey. Reply.
Devor, do you read me?
Kelsey to Kiros.
This is Kiros.
Devor isn't responding. There
must be too much interference from
the baryon sweep. Go find him and
see if he finished by-passing the
regulator on deck seven, then meet
us in Main Engineering.
Understood.
Who are you? What are you doing
on my ship.
The baryon sweep uses a high-frequency
plasma field. That
phaser won't work.
You're probably right.
But I'm willing to bet that this
will.
What's going on in Main
Engineering?
I suggest you cooperate.
You're Starfleet... you won't kill
me.
Are you sure?
I guess you're right.
... yes, but Tyrellian laser-art
is very similar in form and
composition.
Oh, of course. Funny you should
mention that. I used to be
stationed on Tyrellia.
Really? There are five Tyrellians
currently serving aboard the
Enterprise.
Fascinating. Not many people know
this, but Tyrellia is one of only
three known inhabited worlds
without a magnetic pole.
I was aware of that. Are you
aware that Tyrellia is also one of
seven known planets...
Are they still at it?
Non-stop. I have to admit it has
a sort of strange fascination...
I mean, how long can two people
talk about... nothing?
Is something wrong?
Uh... I don't know. I'm getting
a weird energy reading from your
table.
I'm sure it's nothing serious.
Perhaps the heating element under
the tray is malfunctioning.
Maybe I should take a look at it.
I'm sure we can handle this,
whatever it is, Commander.
There's no need to concern
yourself.
I really think I should look at
that heating element. If it
overloads under --
It's all right.
What's that all about?
We'll look into it. You don't
have to concern yourself.
Orton, now!
Stay right where you are.
Reduce the plasma pressure to zero
point six percent nominal.
Zero point six.
How does the conduit look?
It's clear.
All right. The main plasma flow
is shunted to the aft conduit.
We're ready up here.
Okay.
That should do it. I think.
Be sure, Neil.
Uh... yes... yes, that does it.
All right... transfer five hundred
milligrams from the reserve system
to the engine core.
Perfect.
Adequate. Disable the containment
overrides and get the interlocks
off the magnetic seal.
Right.
Pomet, prepare the transport
assembly.
Keep watching the power flow, it
might...
Keep working.
Where did he come from?
I found him on deck seven.
Who are you?
My name is Mott. I'm... the
barber.
The barber? What the hell are you
doing here? Everyone was supposed
to be evacuated to the surface.
I... I know. But, I wanted to go
riding and I didn't have my
saddle, so I came back --
Your saddle?
That's right. I left it in the
corridor on deck seven. When the
power went off, I got lost and
didn't know where to go so --
All right, shut up.
Any sign of Devor?
No.
If he's off looting at a time like
this...
All right, go find him and make
sure nothing's wrong.
Salter. Get over here and keep an
eye on our... barber.
Sit down.
Sure, okay. You don't need to
point that at me.
Just do what I tell you, and you
won't have to worry.
How long until you're ready?
Forty, maybe fifty minutes.
The baryon sweep hits this
compartment in thirty minutes.
The field diverter will protect
us.
It's not us I'm worried about,
it's that storage unit. I want
the trilithium resin...
... in there and secured before the
sweep gets here. I don't want to
take any chances.
Understood.
They haven't tried to communicate
with the outside.
No demands, no political
statements, no theft... they must
want something.
Orton is not as calm as he looks.
He's very agitated and nervous...
as if something's gone wrong.
It is possible that Geordi upset
their timetable when he saw the
hidden weapons.
Orton could be improvising...
maybe he didn't plan to take us
hostage this early... so now he
doesn't know what to do...
If they do not have a plan for
this contingency, we may have the
initiative.
Maybe, but we have to think of a
way to use it...
How's Geordi?
There's no permanent damage. I've
adjusted the optical transducer in
his VISOR to block some of the
pain receptors in his brain, but
it's only partially effective.
What about Hutchinson?
There was nothing I could do for
him.
I still need to get Geordi to a
medical facility.
I doubt he'll agree to that.
If we told him Geordi was dying he
might give us access to a medical
kit... maybe we could make a
weapon from some of the tools...
Perhaps we can use the VISOR as a
weapon. If the optical transducer
were modified, it may be possible
to generate a hypersonic pulse.
A hypersonic pulse would overload
the audio receptors of everyone in
the room. It would cause
immediate unconsciousness.
Can you make the adjustments to
the VISOR by yourself? It's going
to look suspicious if both of you
go over there.
I'll try... Geordi may have to
help me through some of it.
All right... try to keep it
casual. Let us know when you're
ready.
Ready.
Begin draining the trilithium at
one hundred milligrams per minute.
Neil, what's going on!?
The primary inducer is completely
fused. There's no way to fix it.
Without the diverter, we don't
have any protection from the
baryon sweep.
I know that. How long until the
baryon sweep hits this section?
About twelve minutes. We should
go to Ten Forward, it's the last
place on the ship that'll be swept
by the baryon field.
All right, we're leaving. But
we're taking the trilithium with
us.
What? The storage unit wasn't
designed to be portable. We can't
just start hauling it through the
ship --
I'll... I'll try to make some
modifications.
Satler's dead... he ran into the
baryon sweep.
And what about Mott?
I don't know. But I don't think
he's a barber. I found this in
the Jefferies Tube.
Kelsey to Kiros.
This is Kiros.
We have a problem. There's a
Starfleet officer still aboard.
He killed Satler and he may have
killed Devor.
He also destroyed the diverter in
Engineering so we have to leave
here before the baryon sweep
enters this section.
What about the trilithium resin?
We're taking it with us to Ten
Forward.
There should be enough time before --
Kelsey. Don't be a fool. You
know better than to try moving
that resin.
Mister Mott... or should I call
you Lieutenant... Lieutenant
Commander perhaps?
You may call me whatever you wish,
but moving trilithium resin
requires very specific equipment.
You can't simply improvise
something.
I wouldn't need to improvise if
you hadn't damaged our field
diverter.
But if you're so concerned about
the trilithium, I suggest you stop
interfering with us -- before you
set off an explosion that would
destroy the Enterprise... and you.
I would rather destroy this ship
than allow that material to fall
into the hands of terrorists.
What makes you think I'm a
terrorist?
Trilithium resin is a highly toxic
waste material produced by our
engines. There's no possible use
for it except as a weapon.
You might be right, Mister Mott.
But we've been planning this for
a long time, and I doubt that
you'll really be able to stop
us... or even slow us down.
That's it... three hundred
milligrams of trilithium.
I'm using a dynamic stabilizer to
act as a control rod...
There. That should keep the resin
stable enough for transport.
Don't look so tense, Neil. If
something goes wrong, you won't
have time to worry about it.
Let's go.
How much further?
Three more decks... then we take
corridor fifteen-B all the way to
Ten Forward.
What's wrong?
We have to find another way up.
That wasn't very clever, Mister
Mott.
If you knew where we were, you
should've attacked us. Now we'll
just take another route... one you
might not be able to predict.
There are only so many ways to Ten
Forward... and Ten Forward is the
only logical place to go if you
want to stay ahead of the Baryon
sweep.
That sweep is just as big a threat
to you as it is to us. In fact,
if I were you, Mister Mott, I'd be
trying to find a way off this
ship.
I plan on leaving the same way you
do... on your ship.
What ship?
Come on, Kelsey. If you've been
planning this for so long, you
must have a way to get off the
Enterprise and leave this system.
I think there's a ship coming for
you. And I plan to be on it.
It's a small ship, Mott... I don't
think there's going to be room for
both of us.
I'm sorry to hear that... I'll
send your regrets.
How is he, Doctor?
He's in a lot of pain, but he
should be fine. He needs some
water.
We're almost ready. But when we
set the VISOR to emit the
hypersonic pulse, there'll be a
short burst of light. We need a
distraction.
They need a distraction.
How long?
A few seconds.
I think I can keep Orton busy for
a few seconds.
I don't think Orton's in a talking
mood, Wil.
You just have to know how to talk
to him.
Orton, I think we should discuss
this situation.
There's nothing to discuss. Sit
down.
I think there's a lot to discuss.
Can't we be reasonable here?
I'm not interested in hearing your
hostage negotiation tactics,
Commander.
It won't hurt you to listen, will
it?
All right.
Thank you. Now the first thing I
think we should discuss is this...
Well, Commander... Here's my
response.
Put your weapon down... slowly.
Kelsey, this is Kiros. I'm on
deck ten. I have Mott.
Is he alive?
Yes.
Good. Meet us at intersection
forty-one.
Understood.
Move.
Give me the trilithium.
How... how much farther do we have
to go?
Not far.
With all the modifications you
made to this unit, will we have
any trouble removing the
trilithium?
No... you just remove the control
rod and then drain the unit...
there shouldn't be any problem.
That's all I wanted to know.
Well... not as clever as you
thought. Where's Pomet?
He shot him with some kind of
arrow.
He's not dead.
Well, he will be soon. The baryon
sweep's nearly here and we don't
have time to go back for him.
What about Neil?
The sweep got him. Let's go.
And you can lead, Mister Mott.
That way if we come to any more of
your little surprises, you'll be
sure to let us know.
I thought you were going to talk
with him.
I did. He just didn't like what
I had to say.
That was a perimeter warning from
the Remmler Array. A small ship
is approaching.
I believe Mister Orton has just
dropped the defense shields.
This has to be what they've been
waiting for.
Data, you're going to be the only
one unaffected by the hypersonic
burst. As soon as everyone's
unconscious, you've got to get to
the computer panel and stop that
ship somehow.
I will try, sir.
Kelsey -- perhaps we can work out
a deal.
You're the only one who needs a
deal, Mott.
My name's not Mott. It's Jean-Luc
Picard.
Captain Picard... this is all
beginning to make sense...
Leave the trilithium here and take
me with you. You can use me as a
hostage instead of threatening --
I'm not a terrorist Captain, and
I don't have a political agenda...
But I know some people who do have
agendas... and who are very
interested in this little
container.
Profit. This is all about profit.
I prefer to think of it as
commerce.
Open the door.
Now go through... slowly.
I guess, I'll be the one to send
your regrets.
Arkaria base, this is Captain
Picard. Deactivate the baryon
sweep.
This is Captain Picard on the
Enterprise. Deactivate the baryon
sweep immediately.
Data to Captain Picard... do you
read me Captain?
Picard here.
Are you all right, Captain?
Yes.
Sir, an unidentified scout ship
has just beamed someone off the
Enterprise. Do you know anything
about it?
I know they won't get very far.
Hold still... you've got a nasty
cut here...
Any luck?
I'm sorry, Captain. I don't know
what could've happened to it.
I've had three security teams
search deck seven and they
couldn't find anything.
Hold still. I can't heal this
cleanly if you keep fidgeting.
I found it, Captain. Someone put
it in a maintenance locker.
Thank you.
You keep a saddle on board?
Worf, I'm surprised at you...
Any experienced rider would
naturally have his own saddle.
It's perfectly normal.
Of course.
It came in very handy.
I just wish I'd had a chance to
use it on a horse.
