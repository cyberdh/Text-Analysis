Captain's log, Stardate 43539.1.
We have moved into orbit around
Bre'el Four to investigate a
potentially catastrophic threat
to the population from a
descending asteroidal moon...
The satellite's trajectory
continues to deteriorate,
Captain... This orbit will bring
it to within five hundred
kilometers of the planet's
surface.
We're predicting the atmospheric
drag will bring it down on the
next orbit.
Have you been able to find any
explanation for this?
No, Doctor... it is a most unusual
phenomenon.
Won't the moon disintegrate prior
to impact?
No, it has a ferrous crystaline
structure and will be able to
withstand tidal forces, Captain...
Couldn't we just blow it into
harmless chunks?
The total mass of the moon would
remain the same, Commander. And
the impact of thousands of
fragments would spread destruction
over an even wider area.
How long before impact...
Twenty-nine hours... projected
somewhere on the western
continent. It would destroy an
area eight hundred kilometers in
radius.
That damage would be
insignificant, Captain, compared
to the seismic repercussions...
massive landquakes, and
tsunami...
The force would raise a cloud of
dust around the planet, leading
to a significant temperature
reduction. We could be looking
at our own ice age.
Commander LaForge, is there any
way the Enterprise might be able
to coax this satellite back where
it belongs... ?
We'd need to apply a delta-vee
of at least four kilometers per
second. Even with warp power to
the tractor beam, it would mean
exceeding recommended impulse
engine output by at least
forty-seven percent. It'd be like
an ant pushing a tricycle... a
slim chance at best...
Given a choice between slim and
none, I'll take slim any day...
Make it so.
Lieutenant Worf, signal all ships
in this sector to rendezvous and
join us in relief efforts.
Aye, sir.
We'll keep you informed of our
progress. Picard out.
Can you give us any more,
Geordi... ?
Not without burning out the
tractor beam emitter... the
circuits are already beyond their
thermal limit.
Delta-vee is ninety-two meters per
second. The mass is too great.
We are having an effect but it
is negligible.
What is that...
Unable to identify source...
Impulse engines passing saftey
limits. We're seconds from
automatic shutdown.
Reduce engines... tractor beam
off...
Worf, what the hell do the sensors
show... ?
The sound is not registering,
Commander...
Red Alert.
Q.
Captain's log, supplemental. We
are no closer to finding a
solution to the deteriorating
orbit of the Bre'el Four moon...
but with the arrival of Q, we now
have a good idea of the cause.
We couldn't drive the tractor
emitters hard enough, Captain...
The beam was flexing, and it was
impossible to transfer enough
kinetic energy to the moon...
Our options?
We did everything by the book and
a little extra... we need more
time or more power and we're short
on both. I'll take a look and see
if there are any rules I haven't
broken.
Keep me advised.
We know you're behind this, Q...
It's not at all my best color...
Behind what... what are you
blathering about, Riker...
What kind of twisted pleasure does
it give you to bring terror into
their lives... ?
What? Whose lives?
The millions of people down there
who are watching as their moon
falls out of the sky...
I haven't the vaguest idea what
you're talking about... and I have
a much more serious problem...
I am no longer a member of the
continuum. My superiors have
decided to punish me.
And punish us as well, it seems...
They said I've spread too much
chaos through the universe and
they have stripped me of all my
powers.
You do not believe me... ? Would
I humiliate myself like this?
If it served your purposes, yes.
It is the truth. I stand before
you, defrocked. I'm condemned
to be a member of this lowest of
species. A normal, imperfect,
lumpen human being.
Turning you into a human was part
of their punishment... ?
No, it was my request. I could
have chosen to exist as a
Markoffian fire lizard or a
Belzoidian flea, anything I
wished... so long as it was
mortal, but I only had a fraction
of a second to mull and I chose...
"this"... and asked them to bring
me here...
Why?
Because in all the universe you
are the closest thing I have to
a friend, Jean-Luc.
He is reading as fully human.
Is there an echo in here?
I'm even sensing an emotional
presence in him. I would
normally describe it as being
terrified.
How rude.
Q, what is it you want...
Your compassion...
All right... Sanctuary on your
ship... dreary as that may sound
to both of us...
Return the moon to its orbit.
I have no powers. Q the ordinary.
Q, the liar. Q, the misanthrope.
Q, the miserable. Q, the
desperate. What must I do to
convince you people...
Die.
Very clever, Worf. Eat any good
books lately?
Fine. You wish to be treated as
a human?
Absolutely.
Mister Worf, throw him in the
brig.
Delighted, Captain.
Jean-Luc... you can't do this...
You will walk or I will carry you.
Given the options -- I'll walk.
You've disappointed me, Jean-
Luc... I'm very disa...
It was a mistake... I never should
have picked human... I knew it
the minute I said it.
To think of the future in this
shell... forced to cover myself
with fabric because of outdated
human morality, to say nothing
of being too hot or too cold,
growing feeble as the years pass,
losing my hair, catching a
disease, being ticklish, sneezing,
having an itch, a pimple, bad
breath, having to bathe...
Too bad.
"Klingon"... I should have said
"Klingon". In my heart, I am a
Klingon, Worf... So you understand
I could never survive in
confinement...
The universe has been my back
yard... this is cruel and unusual
punishment. As a fellow Klingon,
if you would speak to the captain
on my behalf, I would be eternally
grateful... which doesn't mean
as much as it used to, I admit.
Be quiet or disappear back where
you came from.
I can't disappear any more than
you can win a beauty contest.
If I ask a very simple question,
do you think you can grasp it
without troubling your intellect
too much... ready? If I still
had powers, would I permit you
to lock me away?
You have fooled us too often, Q.
Perspicacity incarnate. Please
don't feel compelled to tell me
the story of "the boy who cried
Worf"?
Computer, activate forcefield.
I demand to be let out of here,
do you hear me? You will
deactivate this cell immediately.
"Romulan". I should have said
"Romulan", you Klingon goat!
The question is -- what sort of
jaded game is he playing this
time?
Maybe he just wants a big laugh.
He'll take Bre'el Four to the edge
of disaster, then pull the moon
back.
Or he may have nothing to do with
it at all.
Do you honestly believe Q is
telling the truth?
Oh, I agree that is highly
unlikely. But we have to proceed
with our current dilemma as though
Q is powerless to prevent it,
don't we?
As he sits, and watches us
struggle...
I don't see much choice.
Mister Worf, hail the Bre'el Four
science station...
They're standing by, Captain...
I'm sorry to report that our first
attempt to restore the moon to
its proper orbit has failed.
We have less than twenty-five
hours before impact...
Our chief engineer is working on
ways to reinforce our tractor beam.
There is hope... but if you have
an evacuation plan...
We have already started moving
people from the coastal areas of
the western continent...
We will make another attempt
shortly... Picard out.
I gotta tell you Geordi is not
optimistic...
What the devil... ?
Data... ?
Sensors are showing broad band
emissions... including Berthold
rays...
Lethal?
No, Commander. Overall exposure
is under seventy-five rems. Very
low intensity. More like a soft
medical scan... I would speculate
that we are being probed...
By whom?
The sensors cannot identify point
of origin. It seems to be coming
from all around us...
Ah, you've come to apologize...
how nice... no offense taken...
all is forgiven...
Enough. I want to know exactly
what is going on, Q...
But Jean-Luc, how can I know what
is going on? I have been in this
dungeon of yours, helpless and
alone... bored to tears...
We have a moon that is
inexplicably falling out of
orbit... and now the ship has been
probed with Berthold radiation...
When? I wasn't aware of it.
Truthfully, Jean-Luc. I have
been entirely preoccupied by a
most frightening experience of
my own. A couple of hours ago,
I started realizing this body was
no longer functioning properly...
I felt weak, the life oozing out
of me... I could no longer
stand... and then I lost
consciousness...
You fell asleep...
It's terrifying... how can you
stand it day after day...
One gets used to it...
What other dangers are in store
for me... I am totally unprepared
for this... I need guidance...
I am unwilling to play along, Q.
If you must keep up the charade,
you will do it alone...
Jean-Luc... wait...
This is getting on my nerves...
now that I have nerves...
You have a moon with a
deteriorating orbit... I've known
moons across the universe... big
ones, small ones... I'm an
expert... I can help you with this
one... if you let me out of here.
Q, we're dealing with millions
of lives... if you have the power
to...
I have no power... But I still
have the knowledge... locked in
this puny brain. You cannot
afford to dismiss that advantage,
can you?
Mister Data, please report to
Detention Cell Three. Computer,
remove the forcefield.
If this is what I must do to save
those lives, I will.
You will not be left alone for
one moment while you are on this
ship, Q. If you are human, which
I seriously doubt, I suggest you
work hard to earn our welcome.
Oh, I'll earn your welcome. You
only dislike me. There are others
in the cosmos that truly despise
me.
You are hereby assigned to Q for
the remainder of his stay...
escort him to Mister LaForge in
Engineering...
Can I have a Starfleet uniform...
What are you looking at?
I was considering the possibility
that you are telling the truth...
and really are human.
It's the ghastly truth, Mister
Data... I can now stub my toe with
the best of them.
An irony.
It would mean you have achieved
in disgrace what I have always
aspired to be.
Humans are such commonplace little
creatures. They roam the galaxy
looking for something, and they
don't even know what it is.
The human race has an enduring
desire for knowledge, and for new
opportunities to improve itself...
There is certainly room for
improvement. The truth is, Data,
they are a minor species in the
grand scheme. Not worth your
envy...
Oh, I do not feel envy.
Good.
I feel nothing at all. That is
part of my dilemma. I have the
curiosity of the human... but there
are some questions I will never be
able to answer... what is it like to
laugh or to cry or to experience
any human emotion... ?
Believe me, life's a lot simpler
without feelings... a lot
simpler...
The moon will hit its perigee in
ten hours... we match its
trajectory... increase emitter
coolant rate so we can apply
continuous warp-equivalent power
nine to the tractor beam. We can
keep pushing it for nearly seven
hours and I think that might do
it... but there's a problem...
The Enterprise will be dangerously
close to the atmosphere.
That's the problem.
This is incredible.
You see something here, Q?
I think I just hurt my back. I'm
feeling pain. I don't think I
like it. What's the right thing
to say... "ow"?
Yeah...
Ow. I don't think I can
straighten up...
Medical assistance to
Engineering...
Q, I've got a few people down on
Bre'el Four who are gonna be hurt
if we don't...
Yes, with your marvelous plan,
you will not only tear the moon
to pieces... but your precious
ship as well.
You have a better idea... ?
I would certainly begin by
examining the cause and not the
symptom.
We've done that, Q... and there's
no way to determine...
This is obviously the result of
a large celestial object passing
through at near right angles to
the plane of the star system...
probably a black hole...
Can you recommend a way to counter
the effect?
Simple. Change the gravitational
constant of the universe.
What... ?
Change the gravitational constant
of the universe. And thereby
alter the mass of the asteroid...
Redefine gravity. How am I
supposed to do that?
You just do it. Where is that
doctor anyway... ?
Geordi is trying to say that
changing the gravitational
constant of the universe is beyond
our capabilities.
Oh. In that case, never mind.
Ah, Doctor Crusher, Starfleet
shipped you back into exile, I
see...
Q says he has hurt his back...
Uh huh.
Well, I wouldn't believe it if
I didn't see it with my own eyes,
... and I still don't believe
it... according to this, you have
classic back trauma, muscle
spasms...
I've been under a lot of stress.
Family problems...
You won't get any sympathy from
me. You've been a pain in our
backside often enough...
Your bedside manner is admirable,
Doctor. I'm sure your patients
recover quickly just to get away
from you.
You know, it might work...
We can't change the gravitational
constant of the universe but if
we wrap a low level warp field
around that moon, we could reduce
its gravitational constant...
make it lighter so we can push
it.
Glad I could help.
Ow... I think.
Now what?
Something's wrong with my
stomach...
It hurts?
It's making noise.
Maybe you're hungry.
What do I ask for? I've never
eaten before.
The choice of meal is determined
by individual tastes.
What do you like?
Although I do not require
sustenance, I occasionally ingest
a semi-organic nutrient suspension
in a silicon-based liquid medium.
Is it good?
It would be more accurate to
say it is "good for me" as it
lubricates my bio-functions.
It doesn't sound too appealing.
What else is there?
A wide variety of items... the
replicator can make anything you
desire.
How am I supposed to know what
I desire?
I have observed that many food
selections are influenced by the
mood of the person ordering...
I'm in a dreadful mood... get me
something appropriate...
When Counselor Troi is in an
unhappy mood, she often has
something chocolate...
Chocolate...
For example, a hot fudge sundae.
I cannot speak from personal
experience, but I have seen it
often has a profound psychological
impact.
I'll have ten hot fudge sundaes.
I have never seen anyone eat ten.
I'm in a really bad mood. And
since I've never eaten before,
I should be very hungry.
This... is not a moment I've been
looking forward to.
I heard you were drummed out of
the continuum.
I prefer to look at it as a
significant career change.
Just one of the boys, huh?
One of the boys with an IQ of
two thousand and five.
The Captain and much of the crew
are not yet convinced that he is
truly human.
Is that right?
AAAH...
He's human.
This is a dangerous creature.
You have no idea... how could
Picard allow her to join the crew
and not me...
It must be frightening... totally
defenseless... after being
omnipotent all those centuries...
I'm warning you... I still have
friends in high places...
... terrorizing one race after
another... teasing them like
helpless animals... delighting
at the fear of your victims...
From now on, I'll do missionary
work...
That would be a very noble cause,
Q.
You could learn a few things from
this one.
Sure, the robot who teaches the
course in humanities.
I am an android, not a robot.
I beg your pardon.
Get used to it, Q.
What?
Begging. You're a pitiful excuse
for a human and the only way
you're going to survive is by the
charity of others.
I'm not hungry.
Captain, sensors are picking up
a cloud of energetic plasma...
bearing three-four-one mark
two-zero... range twelve kilometers
and closing...
On screen.
Energy patterns are reading as
highly organized...
A lifeform?
Mister Worf, attempt to make
contact...
Receiving a signal, sir... on
speaker...
Computer, analysis of signal...
Signal patterns indicate
intelligence. Unable to derive
necessary referants to establish
translation matrix.
Calamarain...
We're being hit by a field of
energetic tachyons... penetrating
the hull... location... deck
ten... forward...
Red alert.
Increase power to shields...
Increasing power by twenty
percent...
No effect...
Increasing to forty percent...
Still no effect...
Adjusting shield harmonics...
Diverting power to the forward
grids.
The added harmonics are blocking
the tachyon field.
HELP ME. SOMEBODY HELP ME...
How the mighty have fallen.
Captain's log, supplemental. We
have sustained light damage from
an attack by an alien species
known as the Calamarain. They
apparently have a grievance with
Q... no doubt one of many
lifeforms that do.
The Calamarain are not very
hospitable creatures. They exist
as swirls of ionized gas.
What did you do to them to
motivate such a vengeance?
Nothing bizarre. Nothing
grotesque.
You tormented them --
A subjective term, Riker. One
creature's torment, is another
creature's delight. They simply
have no sense of humor... a
character flaw with which you can
personally identify.
I say we turn him over to them.
Oh, my mistake... you do have a
sense of humor... a dreadful one.
I'm serious.
Of course. You knew this would
happen, didn't you?
I assure you one cannot anticipate
the Calamarain, Picard... they're
intelligent, yes... but
undependable... very flighty...
But you have so many enemies, Q,
of various shapes and sizes...
certainly you must have been
concerned that once you became
mortal... some of them might try
to look you up...
It occurred to me.
With all your chatter about
"friendship", the real reason
you're here is for protection,
isn't it?
You're so bright, Jean-Luc. Yes,
of course, you're correct. I know
human beings. You are all sopping
over with compassion and
forgiveness. The human race can't
wait to absolve almost any
offense. It's an inherent
weakness in the breed.
What you call weakness, some of
us would call strength.
Call it what you want, Picard.
I know you'll protect me even
though I've tortured you now and
again...
Fighting off every species you've
insulted would be a full time
mission. And it's not the one
I signed up for.
Indeed. Human or not, I want no
part of you. We will deposit you
at the first starbase. Let them
deal with you...
But I can be a valuable member
of your team, Picard...
As though you have the faintest
notion about team-work or
cooperation...
I can learn. I'm human.
Then I suggest you apply to
Starfleet Academy...
Don't use me as a reference.
He has provided important
theoretical guidance for Geordi's
analysis of the Bre'el satellite,
Captain.
It seems you have an advocate,
Q.
I am only stating a fact,
Counselor.
Mister LaForge, your status?
I've been putting together a
program to extend the forward
lobe of our warp field. The field
coils are not designed to envelop
such a large volume. But I'm
attempting to modify their
alignment parameters.
Maintaining field integrity will
be difficult, Geordi.
I think we can do it manually.
The moon's reaching its perigee
in fourteen minutes...
Mister Data, escort Q to
Engineering...
You will assist Mister LaForge.
Mister Worf, hail the Bre'el Four
science station.
Picard really thinks I can't cut
it on his starship... I can do
anything his little trained
minions can do.
I do not perceive that your skills
are doubted, Q. I believe the
captain is more concerned with
your ability to interact
successfully with... his "little
trained minions".
Human interpersonal relationships
are most complex... your
experiences may not have
adequately prepared you.
I don't want human interpersonal
relationships. I just want to
prove to Picard that I'm
indispensable.
To function aboard a starship,
or in any human activity, you will
have to form relationships.
Why does this have to be so
hard...
Of more immediate importance is
your ability to work within
groups...
I've never been any good in
groups... it's difficult working
in a group when you're
omnipotent...
The tides reached ten meters on
the last orbit. They are already
beginning to swell again. We have
a lot of frightened people down
here, Captain...
Your moon has begun moving toward
its perigee, Doctor... we are
prepared to make our attempt...
Our population has already taken
shelter... but I'm afraid no
shelter will be adequate if you
fail... Especially for the
people on the western continent.
Whatever the results, we know
you've done your best, Picard.
It's appreciated.
I'll keep you advised, Doctor.
Picard out.
Captain, sensors are reading
increased energy output from the
Calamarain...
LaForge to bridge. The moon has
reached its minimum orbital
distance... it's time, Captain...
We'll have to lower shields...
Proceed.
Mister Worf, keep a close eye on
Q's friends out there...
Understood.
Okay, everyone, here's what we're
going to do...
Q, everybody already knows what
they're going to do, except for
you... now here's what I need...
LaForge, obviously my knowledge
and experience exceed yours...
by about a billion times... so
if you'll just step aside
gracefully...
Your experience will be most
valuable to me if you can manually
control the field integrity...
Don't be foolish. That's a waste
of my talents...
Get to the controls or get the
hell out of here...
Data, you're my liason to the
bridge... I'll need you with me...
Who does he think he is to give
me orders...
Geordi thinks he is in command
here... and he is correct.
Engineering, holding at station
keeping, range six hundred and
forty meters.
Containment fields to flight
tolerance.
Warp core to ninety percent.
Engage field coils. Tractor beam
to stand-by. Field output... ?
Field output... ?
Two-seventeen...
Impulse engines to full. Ready
to engage tractor beam.
Lowering shields. Engage tractor
beam.
Extending warp field forward.
Engineering, is that the forward
limit?
Yes, Captain... we are unable to
encompass the entire moon...
Do you recommend we proceed... ?
The two parts of the moon will have
different inertial densities...
I can adjust the field symmetry
to compensate...
I doubt it.
You don't know what this ship can
do, Mister...
Yes, Captain... I think it still
might work... increasing power
to tractor beam and warp field...
And if you're wrong, the moon will
crumble due to subspace stress...
don't say I didn't warn...
Shut up, Q.
I will not be spoken to in this
manner...
Data...
Q, I strongly advise that you
return to your post.
Inertial mass of the moon has
decreased to approximately
two-point-five million metric
tons...
It's working. We can move it.
Firing impulse engines...
The moon's trajectory has
moved point-three percent...
point-four percent...
Emergency... shields up...
Disengage tractor beam...
Calamarain attacking...
Shields holding... tachyon field
repelled...
Captain, the impact of the blast
is pushing us into the upper
atmosphere...
Hull temperature rising... two
thousand degrees... two thousand
five hundred degrees.
Moving to full impulse power...
we've gotta get out of here...
Calamarain are resuming attack...
They've overpowered the shields...
hull penetration... deck
thirty-six... Engineering...
Geordi, can you direct any more
power to the shields... ?
We need all the power we have to
get out of the atmosphere,
Commander.
Try activating the structural
integrity field.
It's not working. Structural
field harmonics on manual.
Hull temperature falling, Geordi...
we're in the clear...
Diverting power to forward section.
Now.
Data... Data... ?
What about me?
The charge nearly knocked out his
positronic net.
What can you do for him?
We'll try to discharge and reset
the motor pathways, recouple
autonomic nodes...
There's overpressure in his
fluidic systems, thermal shock...
If he was mortal, he'd be dead.
Let us not overstate matters here,
Doctor... I am mortal and I
survived...
The cheers are overwhelming.
You exceed your own standards of
selfish preoccupation. Have you
no concern for the officer who
very probably saved your life?
He's strong, he'll survive.
Osmotic pressure still negative.
Maybe if we by-passed the flow
regulator...
It would be helpful if everybody
just got out of here now...
We'll let you know as soon as
there's anything to tell you.
Geordi, the moon's trajectory... ?
All we did was buy ourselves
another orbit at most... we can
try again when it comes back to
the perigee...
And when we drop our shields, the
Calamarains go after Q again...
He's not worth it, Commander.
Come...
You're right, of course. I am
extraordinarily selfish. It's
served me so well in the past...
It will not serve you here.
Don't be so hard on me, Jean-Luc.
You've been mortal all your life.
You know all about dying. I've
never given it a second thought.
Or a first thought for that
matter.
I could have been killed. If
not for Data... that one, brief
delay he created, I would have
been gone. No more me. And
nobody would have missed me, would
they?
And yet Data may have sacrificed
himself for me. Why? Why would
he risk his own life for mine?
That is his special nature. He
has learned the lessons of
humanity well...
I ask myself if I would have done
the same for him. And I am forced
to realize the answer is no. And
I feel... I feel ashamed.
I am not your father confessor.
You will not receive absolution
from me, Q. You have brought
nothing but pain and suffering
to my crew. And to this very
moment, I am not entirely
convinced that this is still not
your latest attempt at a bad joke.
It is a bad joke. On me. I am
the joke of the universe. The
king who would be man.
As I learn more and more about
what it is to be human, I am more
and more convinced that I will
never make a good one. I just
don't have what it takes,
Jean-Luc. Without my powers,
I'm frightened of everything. I'm
a coward. I'm miserable.
And I don't think I can go on this
way.
He's going to be all right.
We're recalibrating his language
circuits... he can't talk to us
yet.
There are creatures in the
universe who consider you the
ultimate achievement, android.
No feelings, no emotions -- no
pain. And yet you covet those
qualities of humanity. Believe
me, you are not missing anything.
But if it means anything to you,
Data... you are a better human
than I.
Where's the Main Shuttlebay?
Main Shuttlebay is located on deck
four.
Take me there...
An unscheduled shuttlecraft has
just been launched.
On Main Viewer.
Opening hailing frequency.
Frequency open.
Shuttle occupant. Identify
yourself.
Don't try to talk me out of it,
Jean-Luc.
Q? Return to the ship at once.
I just can't get used to following
orders.
Captain, the plasma cloud is
moving toward the shuttle.
It's easier this way. They won't
bother you after I'm gone.
Engineering, prepare to extend
shields...
Please, do not fall back on your
tired cliche of charging to the
rescue in the nick of time... I
do not wish to be rescued... My
life as a human being is a dismal
failure. Maybe my death can have
a little dignity.
There is no dignity in suicide...
Yes, I suppose you're quite right.
The death of a coward. So be it.
Anyway, as a human, I'd die of
boredom.
This goes against all my better
judgment...
Transporter Room Three, lock on
to Shuttle One... beam it back to
it's bay.
Aye, Captain...
Well, it's a perfectly good
shuttlecraft...
Captain, unable to transport...
For some reason, I can't lock on...
Worf, are you sensing any sort
of interference from the
Calamarain?
No, Commander, but they are
continuing to move toward the
shuttle.
Geordi, extend shields around
Shuttle One...
Extending shields ...
Commander... the shields are
frozen...
Cause...
Unknown.
Lock on tractor beam...
Tractor beam is not functioning
either...
What the hell is going on?
Not bad, Q. Not great. But not
bad.
Q...
Sacrificing yourself for these
humans... ? Do I detect a selfless
act... ?
You flatter me. I'm only trying
to put a quick end to a miserable
existence.
What a dreadful color.
What are you doing here?
I've been keeping track of you.
Really? I always felt you were
in my corner...
Actually, I was the one who got
you kicked out...
You're incorrigible, Q, a lost
cause. I can't go to a single
solar system without apologizing
for you... and I'm tired of it...
I wasn't the one who misplaced
the entire Deltived asteroid
belt...
This is not about me.
I have better places to be. But,
somebody had to keep an eye on
you in case you still found a
way to cause trouble... even as
a member of this limited
species...
I hope I've kept you amused.
Barely. But these humans are
rather interesting... I'm
beginning to understand what you
see in them. After all the
things you've done, they're still
intent on keeping you safe.
A genetic weakness of the race.
And they're still at it. They
just tried to beam you back or
whatever they call it... I
stopped them...
Well then, if the Calamarain will
just hurry up and finish this,
we'll get you on your way...
No, I put them on hold too.
There's still this matter of the
selfless act...
You and I both know that the
Calamarain would have eventually
destroyed the Enterprise to get
to you... and that's really why
you left...
It was... a tiny bit selfless...
wasn't it...
And there's my problem. I get
back to the continuum and tell
them you committed a selfless act
just before the end... I'm gonna
be tied up with questions and
explanations for centuries...
Q, I've learned my lesson...
Remember who you're talking to
here... all knowing, all seeing...
Fine. You have your powers back.
Try to stay out of trouble...
And they wanted to destroy me,
did they?
If you think I tormented you in
the past, my little friends --
wait until you see what I do with
you now.
Q --?
I was just seeing if you were
still watching
Sir, the aliens have disappeared.
And so has the shuttle.
Scan the sector...
I have, sir.
Well, I guess that's the end of
Q.
Au contraire, mon capitaine...
heee's back...
I have been forgiven, embraced
by my brothers and sisters of the
continuum... I am immortal again,
omnipotent again...
Swell.
Don't fret, Riker... my good
fortune is your good fortune.
I don't need your fantasy women,
Q...
You've become so stolid,
Commander... you weren't like this
before the beard...
Very well...
Q...
But I feel like celebrating...
I don't.
All of it.
Now, at the risk of being rude...
Yes, I have once again overstayed
my welcome. As a human, I was
ill-equipped to thank you, Picard.
But as myself, you have my
everlasting gratitude.
Until next time, of course. But
before I go, there is a debt I
must repay...
... to my professor of the
humanities... I have decided my
dear Data to give you something
very, very special...
If your intention is to make me
human, Q...
No no no no no... don't be
foolish... I would never curse
you by making you human... Let's
just call it a going away present.
Uh, Data... Data? Why are you
laughing?
I do not know. But it was a
wonderful... feeling.
Bre'el Four hailing us, Captain.
On screen, Lieutenant.
Captain Picard... you've done
it...
I'm sorry... ?
The moon is back in its normal
orbit. How did you manage it?
I didn't. Stand by, Bre'el
Four...
Let's see it, Worf...
Mister Data, your analysis...
The moon's altitude is fifty-five
thousand kilometers, projected
orbit is nearly circular. There
is no further danger to the
planet.
Good. Ensign, set a course for
Station Nigala-Four.
Perhaps there's a little humanity
left in Q after all.
Don't bet on it, Picard.
