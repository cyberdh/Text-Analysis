Captain's log, Stardate 43714.1.
We have finally succeeded in
eradicating the plague on Cor
Caroli Five, and are now
preparing to leave orbit and
proceed to our next mission --
-- a rendezvous with the USS
Hood to assist their terraforming
efforts on Browder Four.
Commander, ship's sensors detect
an abnormal energy reading in the
captain's quarters.
Type?
Undetermined.
Riker to Captain Picard.
Security team to captain's
quarters --
Picard to Enterprise.
Anyone receiving this
transmission, please respond.
Security override. Priority one.
Is something the matter,
Lieutenant?
It's all right. I'm not going
to hurt you.
Who -- ?
Captain...
Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.
Captain Picard! We've studied
your missions at the Academy...
Mitena Haro, first year cadet,
Starfleet Academy.
Perhaps you can explain what this
is all about.
Unfortunately, I can't, Mister...
Tholl. Kova Tholl, of Mizar Two.
Well, Mister Tholl, all I know
is that I've been brought here
against my will.
Wherever "here" is...
The same thing happened to me,
sir. I was alone, studying...
and I fainted. When I came to...
That was about three days ago.
And you, sir?
I've been here twelve days,
possibly more. I had been
meditating privately -- and for no
reason whatever, I lost
consciousness.
What can you tell me about our
captors?
Nothing. They've never shown
themselves.
Four sleeping areas... that
implies we'll be joined by another
captive...
Food?
It's edible... but I wouldn't call
it food.
I wouldn't touch that.
Why not?
If it's the door lock, the
combination is too complex to hit
at random -- I tried it, and was
punished.
Punished -- how?
Severe pain... some sort of energy
beam.
I won't get near that panel
again...
The Enterprise will find us, won't
it, sir? As soon as they discover
you're missing, they'll start to
search... Won't they?
Of course they will. They'll do
everything they can. In the
meantime, we keep our heads...
... and enjoy the hospitality.
Yes, sir.
Sir, the Hood has arrived at the
rendezvous point. They are
expecting us in thirty-six hours.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Mister Data. The nearest pulsar
is in the Lonka cluster, is it
not?
Correct, sir.
And what do we know about that
pulsar?
A great deal, sir. It is a
rotating neutron star of
approximately four point three
five six solar masses.
Mister Crusher -- how long would
it take us to get there?
At warp seven... thirty-four
minutes.
Mister Crusher -- make it so.
Sir?
Set course for the Lonka pulsar.
Warp two.
Aye, sir.
Sir, at warp two -- we'll arrive
at the pulsar in thirty-one
hours...
Thank you, Ensign. Engage.
Captain, are we delaying our
rendezvous with the Hood?
We may have to.
Mister Worf, contact the Hood and
inform them of our delay.
Aye, Commander.
Belay that.
There'll be no further
communications off this ship
without my prior authorization.
Commander -- I'd like a word with
you.
Mister Data -- you have the
bridge.
Aye, sir.
Data -- any guesses as to what
this is all about?
I see no point in randomly
selecting alternative motivations
for the captain's actions
considering that not enough
information has been offered to
make any one "guess" superior to
another.
In other words, you don't know
either.
Number One... You know I like to
keep you well informed as to the
nature of our missions.
Yes, sir.
And if I don't inform you --
there's a reason.
I don't like keeping you in the
dark, Commander... but for the
next few days I won't be able to
be as communicative as usual.
It may make things difficult for
you...
Don't worry about me, sir. I can
handle it.
And the crew?
You can count on us all, sir.
I appreciate that, Number One.
Picard -- what are you doing?
Attempting to show our captors
that we possess intelligence.
You don't think they know that
already? They can hear us
talking...
They may not realize we are
communicating through language.
Captain Picard's letting them know
that we comprehend mathematics...
by tapping out the first six prime
numbers.
I know what he's doing. I'm
trying to understand why.
To get their attention.
Oh, you may get their attention,
all right... and they'll give you
a dose of agony for using the
keypad.
I'll take the chance. It's
imperative that we communicate
with our abductors... find out
what they want.
Obviously, they want us.
Obviously. But why? What made
our captors choose us? What makes
us special?
I couldn't say, Captain. I'm
certainly not special -- I'm just
one cadet.
You're a Bolian. There are very
few Bolians in Starfleet.
I am one of three in the Academy.
The other two have academic
records much better than mine...
What's your best area of study?
Impulse propulsion systems. I'm
really good with field coils...
Good enough to be useful to our
abductors?
I don't know. Maybe.
But if they needed an engineer,
sir, why didn't they take a "real"
one? Why pick a Starfleet cadet?
That, I can't answer.
The Bolians are maintaining an
uneasy truce with the Moropa,
are they not?
That's right.
But this doesn't look like Moropa
technology... and, even assuming
the Moropa wanted me, why would
they want either of you?
I've never even heard of the
Moropa. My race has no enemies.
None? In the last three hundred
years of Mizarian history, your
planet has been conquered six
times!
And we've survived by not
resisting. Mizarians value peace
above confrontation.
Then you have no idea who might
have done this.
No. I don't know of anyone who
bears malice toward my race.
Or against you personally?
You can't mean to suggest that
someone with a personal grudge
against me has gone to all this
trouble...
I'm not suggesting anything. I'm
merely trying to come up with an
explanation for your abduction.
I'm sorry, Picard -- I can't give
you one. I am neither important
enough to hold for ransom nor
radical enough to be dangerous.
I'm a simple public servant...
assistant to the regent of
Pozaron, our third-largest city.
Nonetheless, Mister Tholl --
It would seem a new arrival is
imminent...
Stop! We mean you no harm...
We are prisoners, like yourself!
We are not the enemy!
Who has done this?
We don't know. We were brought
here the same way you were. Our
captors refuse to show
themselves.
I don't trust you...
You must trust us. We wish only
to return to our worlds. Were
you abducted from Chalna?
You know my planet?
Yes. I visited there twelve
years ago.
Your five... and twenty more.
Ouch.
If it's too rich, fold.
I'm thinking, I'm thinking...
Think less, play more.
I say he folds.
I believe you are incorrect,
Commander.
In situations where more than two
players have asked for three cards
and the minimum raise was ten,
Geordi has stayed in the game
seventy-three percent of the
time.
I still say he folds.
I don't want to hurt my average.
Enter.
Counselor, gentlemen. Forgive
the intrusion... I was just
passing by.
You are always welcome, Captain.
Don't let me interrupt... please
continue.
Bet is twenty-five to you,
Lieutenant.
You are bluffing.
So was I.
I was wondering, Mister La
Forge... what's our engine
efficiency status?
Operating at ninety-three percent,
sir.
That's good, but I'd like to
increase that efficiency to
ninety-five percent.
I'll get on it right away, sir.
It wasn't an order, Mister La
Forge. You can get to it later.
I don't wish to disrupt your
recreation.
No problem, sir.
Lady Luck left me long ago.
Would you care to join us, sir?
We have an opening.
I'd rather just observe, if you
don't mind.
Of course not.
Your bet, Counselor.
Pair of threes.
Flush. Queen high.
That beats my three fours.
Well played, Counselor.
May I have a word with you?
Certainly, sir.
Forgive me, gentlemen. I'll
return your player in a moment.
Take your time, sir... she's won
almost every hand.
I wanted to ask you about the
crew... how are they reacting to
our sudden change in course?
I've sensed no unusual reaction,
Captain.
After all -- such a change is
hardly out of the ordinary.
Aren't they curious or concerned
as to why?
Curious, yes -- concerned, no.
They trust you.
And how far do you think that
trust goes?
Sir?
I know... the crew has always had
full confidence in me.
But if that were to change...
I'd inform you, sir... of course.
Thank you, Counselor.
My given name is Esoqq.
Has it a meaning?
Yes... it means "fighter."
I'll bet half the names in the
Chalnoth language mean "fighter."
Mizarians. Your names all mean
"surrender."
We are a peaceful race, a race
of thinkers --
A race of cowards.
And you? I don't know your
people.
I am Mitena Haro, of Bolarus Nine.
I'm a Bolian.
Yes, that would follow.
Who would want to imprison a
child?
I'm not a "child" --
Esoqq -- I've been trying to
determine if we have a common
enemy... someone who'd have reason
to confine us here.
There are Chalnoth who would kill
me if they could... but kidnap?
There is no reason.
You have many enemies?
None of consequence. I've slain
all the ones who mattered.
That shocks you, Bolian?
A little...
I'm not surprised... I've heard
about your race. You're
uncivilized -- you have no laws,
no system of government --
The Chalnoth have no use for laws
or governments! We are strong
-- we obey no one.
You live in anarchy, murdering
one another -- that mentality
may get us all killed.
And you may be the first...
Both of you -- this is getting
us nowhere.
Neither is asking us useless
questions, Picard.
But if you must pursue the topic,
answer this: who are your enemies?
The Federation's in conflict with
half the galaxy.
That's not true --
Isn't it? How long have you and
the Romulans been adversaries?
Quite a while, Mister Tholl. And
I'm perfectly willing to entertain
the hypothesis that our captors
are Romulans.
But what would Romulans want with
you?
My brainpower, perhaps. It's well
known that my species possesses
superior intelligence... and I
am considered among the smartest
of my people.
And the least modest.
What is this?
Food.
The only food?
It would seem so.
Poison!
Then there's nothing here for
you to eat?
You.
Don't even think that! Picard
-- you won't let him...
Esoqq -- how long can you go
without food?
Three days. Perhaps four.
No longer?
No longer.
All tests indicate the same result
-- you're in great shape.
I've never felt better.
I see.
Then why did you come in? Your
annual physical wasn't due for
another month.
You usually have to remind me,
then badger me, and finally order
me to report. For once, I thought
I'd save you the trouble.
Jean-Luc -- be honest with your
doctor. Were there any symptoms
or warning signs you haven't told
me about?
As far as I know, I'm in perfect
health.
Well, then... return to your post.
Will you dine with me tonight?
In Ten-Forward?
How about my quarters? More
intimate.
You're full of surprises today,
Jean-Luc.
I take that to be a yes.
Picard -- is it wise to attempt
an escape?
It's imperative.
Why? So far, our captors haven't
mistreated us.
We've been kidnapped, locked in
a room -- you don't think that's
mistreatment?
They haven't hurt us, have they?
I think we should just be patient
until we find out what they want.
We can no longer afford to be
patient. If we don't act soon,
Esoqq will starve...
If we antagonize them, they may
decide we're more trouble than
we're worth... kill us, and go
capture another four.
I agree we're taking a risk.
But I see no alternative.
Well, I refuse to help.
As you wish, Mister Tholl.
We must open this panel.
Not very sturdy...
Haro -- stand back.
The design is simple... crosscircuiting
the door mechanism should be easy.
Make it so.
Yes, sir.
I think I've got it...
I warned you...
Out with it, Jean-Luc.
Out with what?
Whatever's been on your mind all
evening long.
Has it been that apparent?
You know me well, don't you?
After all this time, I ought to.
I have been preoccupied. I've
been thinking about us... and the
choices I've made.
We've both made choices...
And I've been wondering if they've
been the right ones.
Sometimes I feel we've allowed
our positions to isolate us...
Our positions necessitate a degree
of professional detachment...
But there's a danger in becoming
too detached... in never allowing
ourselves to get closer.
Is that what you want, Jean-Luc?
To get closer?
You're a very attractive woman.
And you're a very attractive man.
But we both know it's not as
simple as that.
Would it be simpler if I weren't
your commanding officer?
Simpler, perhaps, but... that's not
the only issue.
Right now, I guess, I'm comfortable
with our relationship the way it is.
Then I'll respect that.
Would you care to dance?
All right.
I don't know if I've ever told
you... but I'm glad you're back
on the Enterprise. I missed
our... friendship.
So did I...
Jean-Luc, if I didn't know you
better... I'd think you were
playing games with me.
Are you sorry you came here
tonight?
I didn't say that.
Good. Because I'm delighted you
did. But perhaps we should call
it a night.
Good night.
I warned you not to provoke our
captors. The next beams might
be lethal.
Not to you. You moved far from
the door...
Of course I did! Being stunned
once was enough.
You claim you were hit by the stun
beam... before the rest of us
arrived. You could be lying.
Maybe our enemy is watching us...
from inside.
You accuse me of collaborating
with our abductors?
Collaboration is what your
species does best!
You did try to talk us out of
attempting to escape...
For all we know, you may be our
captor.
Impossible. I'm a Mizarian. My
people are not agressive --
How can we be sure you're a
Mizarian? What if you're an
impostor?
This is nonsense! What if you're
an impostor?
Esoqq was the last one to
appear... and he is the only one
with a weapon...
Which I may still use...
Tholl -- our captors have
transporters and stun beams. I
hardly think they'd try to keep
us at bay with a knife.
Then maybe she's an impostor.
She could have triggered the stun
beams deliberately.
I was hit, too...
To forestall suspicion! You were
very quick to volunteer...
Tholl -- I asked her to open
the door.
You mean ordered her. You've
been giving orders from the moment
you got here... trying to make
everyone do what you want.
What I want is for all of us to
escape.
Why should we believe you?
Captain Picard's put his life at
stake for others many times...
the primitive culture on Mintaka
Three, the Wogneer creatures in
the Ordek Nebula...
Cor Caroli Five...
Right -- helping to cure the Phyrox
Plague.
And how do we know this is the
heroic Captain Picard? We have
no proof of his identity...
You've wasted our time with failed
attempts to communicate with
them or escape. Is that your
task -- to keep us busy so we're
off-guard?
What have you to say, Picard?
First officer's log, supplemental.
Although we're still two hundred
million kilometers from the Lonka
pulsar, the Captain has ordered
us to slow to one-half impulse.
He has offered no explanation.
I don't understand why we're
going to this pulsar. And
creeping up on it at half impulse
makes even less sense...
The captain's given unusual orders
before...
I know... but this time it's
different. He's different. I
can't put my finger on it... but
I'm worried.
The captain does seem... detached
from his emotions.
Mister LaForge -- we are
operating at ninety-six percent
engine efficiency. Well done.
Thank you, sir.
When we arrive at the pulsar, I'm
going to need everyone at their
best. I know I can count on you
all.
Of course, Captain.
Excellent.
An ale for me, please...
... and for my officers...
In fact, ales for everyone.
Here's to the finest crew in
Starfleet.
You know, back when I was in the
Academy, we would follow each
toast with a song.
An unusual tradition.
Let's see if I can remember
one...
(Insert old English or Irish
drinking song -- i.e., "Garry
Owen")
Commander... What's the captain
up to?
That's not the captain I know...
... We have a mission that has no
apparent purpose... by itself,
I can accept that, all of us
can... because the captain says
it is important and we trust
him... Then he runs the crew
through efficiency drills for the
first time in my tour of duty...
but if he says we need them, we
need them... because we trust the
captain. But we also have a
captain singing drinking songs with
his men...
... a captain who's come to the
poker game for the first time...
And he was very odd with me
afterwards... he asked me to warn
him if the crew started to lose
confidence in him...
Any signs of mental stress or
trauma?
He came in for a physical without
a word from me...
Anything unusual, doctor?
He was in perfect health... every
test result identical to his last
physical... that's kind of unusual
in itself, actually...
It's almost as though he wanted
to establish that there was
nothing wrong with him.
There was one... other...
thing...
He asked me to his cabin for
dinner... I think he tried to
seduce me.
Which brings us to a most serious
possibility -- is there an outside
influence at work here...
I can detect no evidence of
telepathic coercion.
Commander, there is one other fact
we have not considered. The
abnormal energy reading in the
captain's quarters that was never
explained.
It is not enough evidence to
justify mutiny.
Worf -- nobody has suggested
removing the captain from command.
Nobody has yet.
And nobody will -- unless we have
solid evidence that the captain
is unfit for duty.
Right now, all we have are
suspicions... not enough to act
upon. The next move is his.
Well, Picard? Prove to us you're
not the enemy.
I can't.
You're right, Tholl. Any of
us could be the enemy. And
there's no way to prove we aren't.
But unless we set aside our mutual
fears and trust one another, we
have no hope of escape.
Sir... how can we trust each
other?
She's right. There may be an
enemy among us.
And what if there is, Mister
Tholl? Shall we continue accusing
one another until hostility leads
to violence? Shall we allow our
suspicions to destroy us?
Let's see if we can deactivate
that stun mechanism...
Orbiting the pulsar at fifty
million kilometers, sir.
The pulsar is exactly as our
records indicate. There appear to
be no anomalies or significant
changes since the last scan by a
Federation ship.
Helm -- take us in to twenty
million kilometers.
Aye, sir.
Mister Worf, divert enough power
to the shields to offset the
increased radiation and magnetic
fields.
Sir, at twenty million kilometers
our shields will be effective for
only eighteen minutes --
Noted, Mister Data.
Captain, may I have a word with
you?
You have the bridge, Mister Data.
Aye, sir.
What is our mission?
I'm under no obligation to tell
you that.
If you don't -- you force me to
take command of this vessel.
On what grounds?
You're endangering this ship...
for no reason.
No reason you're aware of.
That's not good enough. Your
behavior has been erratic --
Erratic enough to justify mutiny?
Do you honestly believe you have
sufficient evidence to convince
a board of inquiry?
No, I don't. But I can't let you
risk the lives of the crew.
Number One... has it occurred to
you that you might be the one with
the problem? I realize you've
been under stress, and I'm willing
to let the matter drop if you
report to Sickbay for a full
examination. Otherwise... I'll
have to relieve you from duty.
Think about it.
That would appear to be the power
lead to the stun device.
It may be "live." Cutting it
could be dangerous.
I don't think it will be. Esoqq
-- your knife, please.
You assured me you'd cooperate.
I may have overloaded it, sir.
Mister Tholl...
Picard, I still think this is a
mistake --
Now what? We're no better off
than when we started!
Captain -- number four shield
has failed. Increasing power to
number three shield to compensate.
Helm -- move us closer. Ten
million kilometers.
Sir -- at that distance, the ship
will not withstand the magnetic
fields and radiation.
Take us in, Mister Crusher.
Belay that order.
You're relieved of duty,
Commander.
Confine Mister Riker to his
quarters.
Mister Worf, I gave you an order.
Maintain your position,
Lieutenant.
You're destroying yourself and
anyone who is foolish enough to
listen to you. Starfleet will
never sanction this.
I'll take that chance.
You're making a terrible mistake,
Will. Listen to me... as your
captain... as your friend...
You've shown none of the concerns
that Captain Picard would show...
the safety of this ship, the
welfare of its crew...
Mister Worf -- remove Commander
Riker from the bridge.
Mister Crusher -- take us away
from the pulsar, heading
one-eight-five mark three-two,
full impulse.
Full impulse -- aye, Commander.
Engage.
I hope you're satisfied, Picard.
You've accomplished nothing.
The sound of your voice is
beginning to anger me.
I think this charade has gone far
enough, don't you?
I don't understand...
Yes, you do. This isn't a holding
cell; it's a laboratory maze --
and we're the white rats. A
carefully concocted test... an
experiment to see how we'd react
under pressure.
How do you know?
It's the only explanation. Look
at the four of us... we do have
something in common: we all react
differently to authority.
You, the anarchist, reject
authority in any form...
... you, the collaborator, defer
to whoever's in control...
... I, a Starfleet Captain, am
trained to command...
... and you, a cadet, have sworn
to obey a superior officer's
authority.
Our captors put us here and
devised obstacles for us to
overcome. We were given food
Esoqq couldn't eat -- to make him
a threat. We were given a door
that wouldn't open -- until all
four of us cooperated. And each
time we succeeded, we were dealt
a reversal -- to set us against
each other again.
While you observed our reactions.
Sir, I've been trying to help --
I found it unlikely that a
first-year cadet would know of
the Enterprise's visit to Mintaka
Three... so I tested you.
Starfleet has classified the Cor
Caroli Five plague "secret." No
cadet would have knowledge of the
incident.
Captain --
You may as well drop the pretense.
I refuse to play along any further
-- I'm quitting the game. As far
as I'm concerned, this experiment
is over.
You are correct, Captain Picard.
To further our knowledge of alien
interaction, we borrowed you,
Tholl, and Esoqq, and replaced
you with replicas.
Replicas?
Our transporter is able to
replicate living matter --
including the brain's many
trillion dendritic connections
where memory is stored.
You mean there's a copy of me on
Mizar Two?
And an impostor running my ship.
No longer. Commander Riker has
taken charge of the Enterprise.
Our species is telepathically
linked; we are all in continual
contact.
Much more efficient than your
primitive vocal communications.
We would like to pursue this
study... but, of course, your
awareness of it would taint the
results.
We will therefore return you to
your places of origin.
Captain!
Hold your positions. Take no
action.
Why did you choose to study the
concepts of authority and
leadership?
Because our species has no such
concepts.
As we are all identical,
distinctions among ourselves are
meaningless. Hence we have no
leaders -- no followers.
We wanted to examine the nature
of command. Under what conditions
will authority be obeyed -- or
disobeyed?
Our replicas of Tholl and Esoqq
explored this issue on Mizar Two
and on Chalna... just as our
Picard replica did on the
Enterprise.
Your responses were most
intriguing.
You had no right to put us through
this just to satisfy your
curiosity.
Why not?
Because kidnapping is immoral.
The lives of other races must be
respected.
This concept of morality is a very
interesting human characteristic.
We shall have to study it
sometime. Until then, Picard --
Number One?
Now, Mister Worf.
What is this?
Why do you hold us?
Because there's something more
you can learn from us. With an
alert crew, even our "primitive
vocal communications" are
unnecessary. Commander Riker
understood I wished to hold you
here...
... he had Mister Data scan you
and pass the information to our
security officer...
... who devised a forcefield that
would entrap you.
But why?
I've decided to perform an
experiment of my own. I want to
see how you react to being
imprisoned.
Captain -- our species cannot bear
captivity.
We were merely curious. We meant
no harm.
We did not, after all, injure you
in any way.
Captivity is an injury, regardless
of how it's justified.
And now that you've had a taste
of captivity, perhaps you'll
reconsider the morality of
inflicting it upon others.
In any event, we now know about
your race -- and we know how to
imprison you. Bear that in mind.
Now get off my ship.
Mister Crusher. Set course for
our rendezvous with the Hood...
Warp eight.
Aye aye, sir.
It's good to have you back.
Status, Number One?
Ship and crew functioning
normally, Captain.
Then my doppelganger caused no
serious damage.
Was the replica convincing?
Very convincing, sir -- but not
perfect.
Not perfect in what way?
Well, sir...
... for one, I simply cannot
believe you're that good a singer.
A singer?
I look forward to reading your
report, Commander. At least, I
think I do.
Captain.
Doctor...
Course laid in, Captain.
Engage.
