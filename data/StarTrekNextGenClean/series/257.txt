Direct hit to the port nacelle...
But -- only minimal damage.
Hit on the starboard nacelle...
again, no appreciable damage.
Wil must've done something to
their weapons.
I believe so, Counselor. It is
now up to us to... play along.
Release inertial dampers and cut
power on decks thirty-one through
thirty-seven.
Set phasers to twenty-five
percent. Return fire.
Aye, sir.
Continue firing!
We've lost three plasma relays on
the disruptors. Auxiliary
power... is not available.
Transfer weapons control to my
station. There's a way to by-pass
the relays and feed power --
The anti-matter containment unit
is starting to buckle!
The Enterprise has been badly
damaged but they still have
superior firepower. If we remain
here, we will be destroyed. The
logical course of action is to
withdraw.
We've done enough damage. Narik,
set course one eight zero, mark
two one five. Warp six.
Initiate.
They're preparing to activate
their warp drive, Commander.
Sir. We will not be able to track
them with our sensors if they go
to warp. I can still disable them
before they --
I am aware of the tactical
situation, Lieutenant. Let them
go.
Sensor sweep eight has been
completed, sir. Still no sign of
the mercenary ship.
Understood. Begin sensor sweep
nine using the lateral array set
to maximum gain.
Aye, sir.
I've gone over every word, every
inflection, every facial
response... but I still haven't
found any kind of code or hidden
message.
Understood. I agree that the
probability that such a message
exists is remote, but I believe we
should check.
I'll keep trying.
Two starships have been sent to
intercept the mercenaries at
Yadalla Prime and Draken Four, in
case they attempt to attack those
planets.
Very well. Inform Starfleet
Command that we will hold position
here until further notice.
So we are just going to... remain
here?
Yes. But we will continue to
pursue all avenues of
investigation which are available
to us.
If we had not allowed them to
escape, this would not be
necessary.
That is correct. However, I
believe Commander Riker wanted us
to let them escape.
I think I've got something.
I've been studying the com link
Commander Riker used to transmit
his command codes.
I didn't see anything at first,
but when I ran the transmission
through a sub-harmonic analysis I
found this.
It was sent on the same carrier
wave as the command codes.
It might be the message you've
been looking for.
Possibly. I will attempt to resequence
the signal.
Begin running a search for a
decryption key.
I'm taking the engines off-line.
How long until we can repair our
battle damage?
It will take at least five hours
to replace the anti-matter
containment unit.
You have three hours, Narik. One
minute beyond that and you'll
answer for it with your life.
I suppose I should thank you.
None of us would be alive if it
weren't for you.
You're welcome.
What's wrong, Commander? Starting
to have second thoughts about
betraying your comrades... because
that's what you've done --
betrayed them... betrayed them in
order to save yourself.
You were just a second-rate
officer before... now you're a
coward and a traitor. How does
that feel?
I don't know. How did that feel?
That's enough.
Galen, get down to the cargo hold
and check those artifacts.
Move.
Tell Baran I'm working as fast as
I can.
What?
I'm trying to decide if you're
incredibly stupid... or incredibly
smart. Why didn't you continue to
fire on the Enterprise when their
shields dropped?
You were there. The disruptors
lost power.
Computer, reset diagnostic for new
sample and begin scan.
I've watched you handle the weapon
systems before. You know exactly
how to by-pass a problem like
that.
And why do you continue to argue
with Riker? It should be obvious
that by alienating him you are
also alienating Baran, and yet you
continue to do it. Why?
Scan complete. Terikon profile
negative.
I'm touched by your concern for my
well-being.
That's not an answer.
Computer, reset diagnostic and
begin scan.
I'm not a prisoner in a Romulan
labor camp, Tallera. I don't have
to answer your questions and I
don't give a damn what you think.
Scan complete. Terikon profile
positive. Ninety-eight percent
probability of match.
Well, whatever it is... it looks
like we've found it.
Tallera to Captain.
Yes?
I'm in the cargo hold. Galen's
made a positive Terikon match on
one of the artifacts.
Is he sure?
He's sure.
Good. Bring it here immediately
and don't let anyone else get near
it.
Understood. Tallera out.
I take it that's good news.
Very. It means we've completed
half of what promises to be a very
profitable mission... and even
better than that it means, I'm
almost ready to get rid of your
friend Galen.
Really?
We have only one more artifact to
find... and once Galen confirms
it's genuine, his usefulness on
this ship will come to a very
sudden end.
I can't say I'm sorry to hear
that.
I'm sure.
Galen may be a loud-mouthed fool,
but sometimes he can be very
perceptive... his observations
about you for instance.
Oh?
After what you did at Calder Two,
I doubt you have much of a future
in Starfleet.
I've... pretty much come to the
same conclusion.
Assuming for the moment that you
were no longer my prisoner... what
would you do now?
I guess I'd have to look for a new
career... there must be a place
where someone with fifteen years
of Starfleet technical knowledge
would be useful.
Do you know of any place like
that?
Possibly.
But if there's one thing I've
learned on this ship, it's to be
cautious... and not to blindly
embrace what seems to be good
fortune. And at the moment, you
seem like a rather large stroke of
luck.
I haven't exactly sworn my undying
allegiance to you, Baran. In
fact, I'd like to know a little
bit more about the job.
Such as?
Such as what you meant by a "very
profitable mission."
I thought you Starfleet types
weren't interested in things like
profit.
I'm not exactly... the "ideal"
Starfleet type.
No, I guess you're not.
All you need to know for now is
that your share could be more than
enough to insure a very long and
very wealthy life far away from
the Federation.
Sounds promising.
It is. But if you want that
share, you'll have to earn it.
And you can start by putting aside
your dislike for Galen and trying
to become his friend.
Why?
Galen has allies among the crew...
they might cause a problem if I
kill him. I want you to get close
to him and find out who they are.
Okay.
One more thing, Riker.
When the time comes, I want you to
kill Galen.
I have completed the analysis of
the signal from the mercenary
ship. I believe these groupings
represent bearings and coordinates
taken from their navigational
system.
So you think this is their flight
plan...
Yes. If I am correct, the
mercenary vessel is heading toward
these coordinates in...
... the Hyralan Sector.
Their maximum speed is warp eight
point seven... it will take them
at least fourteen hours to reach
that position.
We could be there in five.
Make it so.
Finally.
Set course for the Hyralan Sector
and engage at warp nine.
Lieutenant, may I see you in the
Ready Room?
Of course.
Lieutenant, I am dissatisfied with
your performance as acting first
officer.
May I... ask in what way?
You continually question my orders
in front of the crew. I do not
think this is appropriate
behavior.
Sir... with all due respect, I
have always felt free to voice my
opinions... even when they
differed from those of Captain
Picard or Commander Riker.
That is true. But in those
situations, you were acting as
head of security, not as First
Officer. The primary role of the
second in command is to carry out
the decisions of the Captain... in
this case, me.
But is it not my duty to offer
you... alternatives?
Yes. But once I have made a
decision, it is your job to carry
it out regardless of how you may
personally feel. Any further
objections should be given to me
in private, not in front of the
crew.
I do not recall Commander Riker
ever publicly showing irritation
with his Captain as you did a
moment ago.
No, sir.
If you feel that you are not
capable of carrying out this role,
I can assign it to Commander La
Forge and return you to Tactical.
I would not enter it as a
reprimand on your record... simply
as a transfer.
I would... prefer to remain at my
current post.
Then I will expect you to conform
to the guidelines I have laid out.
Aye, sir.
Mister Worf... I am sorry if I
have ended our friendship.
Sir... it is I who has jeopardized
our friendship, not you. If you
will... overlook this incident, I
would like to continue to consider
myself your friend.
I would like that as well.
Thank you, sir.
Your time is almost up, Narik. I
need warp power.
You can't rush this, Baran... if
the constrictor coil isn't
perfectly aligned, the entire antimatter
containment unit could
rupture... and that would be the
end of the engines, the ship, and
us.
I don't have time for your
excuses. We have a schedule to
keep.
Can you do this any faster?
I think Narik may be right this
time... a constrictor coil will
only align so fast. We'll have to
wait.
How long?
I'd say another hour, maybe less.
One hour.
Where is Galen?
In his quarters.
Typical. Everyone else is working
and he's asleep. Someone should
go kick him out of bed.
I'll take care of it.
Good.
It's good to see you, too.
I've had a few... unpleasant
surprises.
This isn't a good idea, Wil.
Baran may get suspicious.
As a matter of fact, Baran's the
one who sent me here.
He told me to "wake you up," but
he really wants me to "pretend" to
get friendly with you and then
help you organize a mutiny... so
he can find your supporters among
the crew and eliminate them.
So here I am... pretending to like
you after all.
Wheels within wheels... I'm
starting to forget which side I'm
on.
All right... what have you found
out so far?
When we get to the Hyralan Sector,
we're supposed to rendezvous with
a Klingon transport ship. I'm not
sure, but I think they might be
delivering another Romulan
artifact to us.
A second artifact... ?
By the way, these artifacts aren't
Romulan... they're Vulcan.
Vulcan?
I've been looking over the glyphs
and pictograms I found on the
Calder Two artifact. There's not
enough data to translate the
inscription, but the alphabet and
symbology are more consistent with
early Vulcan artifacts than
Romulan.
Do these artifacts have some kind
of religious or cultural
significance... something that
would make them valuable enough to
kill for?
I don't know.
If I could just get access to the
Enterprise computer for even a few
moments...
What will Baran do once we obtain
the second artifact?
You're supposed to confirm it's
authentic...
... and then I'm supposed to kill
you and take your place.
You always seem to be after my
job.
Once Baran decides I've outlived
my usefulness... he can simply
kill me with the neural servo.
I think... we'd better start
planning a mutiny.
We need a new captain... so I've
come to one inescapable
conclusion...
I agree.
But I don't think that's you.
Oh?
I don't trust you, Galen... and I
don't think the rest of the crew
does either. They're not going to
follow you.
And who do you think they'll
follow... you?
No. But they will follow
Tallera... and so will I.
Who are you?
What?
You're no smuggler... and I don't
think your name's Galen.
You will tell me who you really
are and what you are doing on this
ship... or I will kill you right
here.
I don't know what you're talking
about.
I will not play games with you.
I found the message you sent to
the Enterprise. When Riker used
his command codes to drop their
shields, you sent a transmission
to them on the same carrier wave.
You're a Starfleet officer.
Do not bother to deny it. It is
the only... logical conclusion.
My name is actually T'Paal... I am
a member of the V'Shar.
Vulcan Security?
That is correct. I infiltrated
this ship a year ago posing as a
Romulan mercenary. I am here to
investigate a possible threat to
Vulcan.
What sort of threat?
First things first, Galen. Who
are you?
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
Enterprise.
Very well. To answer your
question, for several years, there
has been a small, but growing
movement of extreme isolationists
on Vulcan... a group that believes
contact with alien races has
"polluted" our culture... and is
destroying Vulcan purity.
This group advocates the total
isolation of Vulcan from the rest
of the galaxy and the eradication
of all alien influences from our
planet.
It sounds like a very... illogical
philosophy.
Agreed. But extremists often have
a logic all their own.
What are these artifacts we're
collecting? I know they're Vulcan
in origin...
I am sure you are familiar with
the ancient history of my
people... before we found
logic... before we found peace.
You were much like my people once
were... a warlike, savage race...
There was even a time when we used
our telepathic abilities as a
weapon... a time when we learned
to kill with a thought.
The Stone of Gol... ?
You know of it?
I know the story from Vulcan
mythology. According to the
legend whoever possessed the stone
needed only to think of throwing
it at someone... and that person
would be killed.
The Stone of Gol is real, but
there is nothing magical or
supernatural about it.
It is a psionic resonator... a
device which focuses and amplifies
telepathic energy. It is one of
the most devastating weapons ever
conceived.
As I recall the legend, the Stone
of Gol was destroyed by the gods
when the Vulcan people found the
way to peace...
The resonator was believed to have
been destroyed during the Time of
the Awakening. Only one piece was
known to have survived and it was
placed in a Vulcan museum under
heavy guard.
Six months ago, that piece was
stolen from the museum. Soon
after, mercenary ships began
raiding archaeological sites
across the quadrant. We believe
that a member of the isolationist
movement is trying to reassemble
the resonator.
A telepathic weapon...
A Vulcan trained in the mental
disciplines would be a formidable
assassin. The entire Vulcan
council could be killed with a
single thought, and there would be
no defense.
My orders are to find that would-be
assassin and stop him.
Since Baran will presumably need
to deliver the artifacts to this
assassin in order to get paid, it
would seem that the best course of
action is to continue with our
little masquerade for now.
Agreed. But Captain... I cannot
allow the resonator to be
assembled. If necessary, I will
destroy this ship, its crew... all
of us... to prevent that from
happening.
Acting Captain's Log: Stardate
47160.1. The Enterprise is
entering the Hyralan Sector which
I believe to be the next
destination of the mercenary ship.
We've arrived at the coordinates,
sir.
All stop. Full sensor sweep.
I'm picking up a small vessel
bearing one two seven mark three
three five.
Is it the mercenary ship?
No, sir... it's a Klingon ship.
It is a Toron-class
shuttlecraft... one passenger.
We're awfully far from the Klingon
Empire... it can't be a
coincidence the shuttle's at these
coordinates.
Agreed.
Open a channel.
I am Lieutenant Commander Data of
the Federation Starship
Enterprise.
Koral.
I take it that is your name?
May I inquire as to your
destination?
No.
May I ask the purpose of your
journey?
No.
Perhaps I have not made our
intentions clear... we are
investigating a --
He seems... most uncooperative.
He may have been curt, but he was
also very worried... even a little
scared.
Sir... I recommend that we bring
the shuttle aboard with our
tractor beam, search it, and
interrogate Koral.
According to the terms of the
Klingon/Federation Treaty, Koral
has every right to free transit
through Federation space. We
cannot board or search his vessel
without cause.
Yes, sir.
However... the Treaty also gives
us the right to conduct... health
and safety inspections of any ship
in our space.
Health and safety inspections... ?
Article forty-seven, paragraph
three, subsection B: "Starfleet
will have the right to insure all
Klingon vessels comply with safety
and navigational regulations as
specified by mutual agreement."
But I am not sure that using this
clause as an excuse to conduct a
search would be consistent with
the spirit of the Treaty.
Yes, sir.
However, if Koral wishes to
contest our actions he can file a
protest with the Judge Advocate
General's office.
Bring the shuttle aboard and then
you and Doctor Crusher may begin
the inspection.
Aye, sir.
Hello.
I'm Doctor Crusher, and this is
Lieutenant Worf.
We're here to conduct the health
and safety inspection of your
ship.
Health and safety inspection...
That's right. You know...
radiation leaks... biochemical
contamination... other health
hazards...
Well... no radiation so far... I'm
sure you're glad to hear that...
Right.
There's an incoming message...
it's from the Klingon shuttle.
It was sent approximately fifteen
minutes ago.
He's at the rendezvous
coordinates... but he's been
detained by the Enterprise.
That's all there is... he stopped
transmitting.
The Enterprise...
How could they have found out
about the rendezvous, Commander?
How could I have known the
rendezvous coordinates? If anyone
sent them a message it must've
been one of you.
Or maybe you're a clever liar.
Quiet.
All that matters now is that the
Enterprise has the second artifact
in their possession.
How can you be sure Koral had the
piece when he was captured?
The Klingon? He reported a
positive Terikon match two weeks
ago.
We have no choice... we'll have to
board the Enterprise and take the
artifact.
You have a very bad sense of
humor, Baran.
They're not expecting an attack,
so they won't have their shields
up... we'll stay just outside
visual range -- they can't pick us
up on their long range sensors...
and then we'll transport a raiding
party aboard.
Do you have any idea how many
security officers they have on a
ship like that?
No, I don't...
... but he does.
I can get you aboard... and I can
find that artifact.
Oh, how convenient... we'll just
beam you aboard your old ship and
then hope that you won't change
your mind and decide to betray us?
I've already saved your life
twice, Galen. I'd think you'd
start to show a little gratitude
by now.
Galen, if you're so worried about
Riker, then you can go along on
the raid to watch him.
Agreed.
Draw weapons and equipment for a
raiding party of five.
In case you are thinking of
betraying us to your friends on
the Enterprise...
... you might remember that I can
still kill you at the first sign
of trouble.
I haven't forgotten.
I have an additional task for
you... one that will prove your
loyalty.
This raid is an opportunity to get
rid of Galen. Once you've found
the artifact... kill him.
I'm sure the health and safety
inspection won't last much longer.
In the meantime, I'm glad we have
this opportunity to get to know
you. May I ask what business
you're in?
I hope we're not causing you too
much inconvenience... were you on
a tight schedule?
Lieutenant Worf has programmed our
replicators to make a very good
approximation of Klingon
bloodwine. I think you will find
it to your liking.
Well, that's my third scan and I
still can't find anything out of
the ordinary.
He must be hiding something. We
should download his computer
memory and analyze it.
I'd have a tough time defending
that as part of a safety
inspection.
We could claim that the computer
was generating abnormal radiation
signatures...
Worf, we're on pretty shaky ground
as it is... we can't just start --
Don't.
Watch that door.
What is going on?
Keep your mouth shut, Klingon.
Surprised to see me, Doctor?
You could say that.
I decided to make a career
change...
It's not in here.
Where's the artifact?
I... don't know what you're
talking about.
Use your brain. They wouldn't be
down here searching the shuttle if
they'd already found it. Koral
must have it with him.
Where's the Klingon pilot?
He's in the Observation Lounge
with Data and Troi.
How far is that?
It's twelve decks away.
Security will not allow you to get
that far.
They won't get the chance. We can
use the transporter in that
shuttle and beam directly to the
Observation Lounge.
Sorry about this...
Koral, if you could tell us
something about the nature of your
mission --
What is this?
Quiet.
Does he have it?
This is it.
Are you sure, Galen?
Yes, I recognize the inscription
pattern from the first artifact.
Commander Riker, by taking this
action you risk charges of
assault, theft, piracy, and
treason.
Really? Then I guess adding one
more charge wouldn't hurt.
Is he dead?
Yes.
Good.
Activate the transporter.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Security alert. Emergency medical
team to the Observation Lounge.
Data to Bridge, raise shields and
begin sensor sweeps for the
mercenary ship.
Aye, sir.
He's all right. He's just
stunned.
I must admit I am experiencing the
same sensation.
This is going to take some time to
explain...
Set course three one zero mark two
one five, warp six.
Where is it?
Oh, I do have something else for
you...
Tell them what happened, Narik.
Riker turned on us... he tried to
kill Galen before we beamed back.
He might have killed all of us.
And I believe he was acting on the
direct orders of Baran.
You betrayed us.
I say this has gone on long
enough. It's time for a new
commander... someone who will
lead us to the profits we've been
promised.
And who would that be? You,
Galen?
He's plotted this all along...
opposed me at every turn...
endangered all of us with his
stubborn refusal to follow orders.
A refusal to follow your orders...
the orders of a small man trying
to fill a role too big for him.
I have kept this crew alive... I
am about to bring us more profits
than any of --
More promises of riches. More
excuses for Baran to fill his own
coffers while the rest of us go
begging. I say it's time for a
change. Who's with me?
It's over, Baran.
Not quite.
As long as I have this, I'm still
in command.
You can't kill us all... you need
us to run the ship more than we
need you to command it.
I don't need to kill you all...
just you, Galen. Somehow I think
that watching you writhe in your
death throes may change a few
minds... and a few is all I need.
What happened?
I switched our transponder codes.
It seemed like a prudent, if
regrettable step.
Baran was nothing. We have a
mission to complete...
... and the crew needs a leader.
There'll be no more "punishment"
on this ship. Do your duties and
I'll see to it that we complete
our mission... and get our
payment.
Remove that.
Orders?
Maintain course and speed for now.
I'm going to find out where and
when we're supposed to deliver our
cargo.
Aye... Captain.
Worf to Commander Riker. Minister
Satok of Vulcan Security is
standing by on a secure channel.
Put it through in here.
Greetings, Commander. How may I
be of service?
Minister, I wanted to let you know
that the mercenary ship which has
been raiding planets in the Taugan
sector is probably on its way to
Vulcan right now.
I do not understand.
I'm sorry. It's been a difficult
couple of days.
I know that one of your operatives
has been investigating the
assembly of the psionic resonator
on a mercenary ship for several
months. I didn't want someone to
make a mistake and start firing at
them when they approach your
planet.
Commander, I believe there is a
problem.
We have no operative aboard a
mercenary ship.
According to Baran's logs, the two
artifacts are supposed to be
delivered... to the T'Karath
Sanctuary on Vulcan.
I know that place. It was an
underground stronghold for one of
the factions during the last civil
war. It's been abandoned for
centuries.
Galen to Bridge. Alter course for
Vulcan.
Understood.
Perhaps you can help me with
something... I've been able to
translate most of the writing on
these pieces...
For the most part, they're just
warnings of death and destruction
for those who oppose the
resonator...
But this hieroglyph on the
anterior has me a bit puzzled.
This is clearly the Vulcan god of
war... and this is the god of
death...
But if you look closely you can
see that there is a third symbol
missing -- which should be on the
final piece. The odd thing is
that typically, the gods of war
and death would stand alone on an
artifact... they would never be
combined with a third glyph.
Fascinating. But I am not an
archaeological expert.
Hmmmm. I'm anxious to see the
final artifact... it may provide
a new insight into Vulcan
mythology.
When we arrive at Vulcan, I will
take these pieces to a secure
holding area before going to the
Sanctuary. I prefer to go
alone... it will arouse less
suspicion among the isolationists.
We shouldn't have any problems
entering orbit.
I told Commander Riker to contact
the Vulcan authorities from the
Enterprise and warn them of our
approach.
I didn't want to risk a
misunderstanding... someone might
have mistaken this for an actual
raid...
It was a wise precaution.
Perhaps I should contact the
Enterprise... have them meet us
at Vulcan in case these
isolationists try to escape.
Your offer is appreciated... but
our security forces are more than
adequate.
I see.
Are you sure it's wise for you to
go to the Sanctuary alone? After
all, they're expecting Baran to
show up, not you. If I
accompanied you, it may seem more
plausible that --
Captain, I understand your human
emotional need to be there at the
final moment... but this is a
Vulcan matter.
Of course.
Thank you.
We have entered orbit of Vulcan.
Tallera... I've decided on a
change of plan. Leave one
artifact here for now. Take the
other... and once we have our
payment in hand, we'll complete
the delivery.
That was not the agreement.
I realize that. But it would be
safer for all concerned if we kept
one piece here.
They will not pay us until they
get both pieces.
They've waited a long time for
this. They won't take any risks
at this stage. Take the piece and
beam down.
That is all I was waiting for.
Go to the navigational computer
and check file one-three-seven-slash-omega.
You'll find a
message secretly transmitted to
the Enterprise, containing our
entire flight plan.
She's right.
That message was sent by Galen...
he's a Starfleet officer.
Why didn't you tell us before?
I wasn't sure until he tried to
stop me from taking the artifacts
to the surface. Then I knew he
was intentionally obstructing our
plans to keep us from being paid.
Tallera's right, I am a Starfleet
officer... but what she's not
telling you is that those
artifacts in her hand are part of
an incredibly powerful weapon.
There's no reward waiting for you
down on the surface. Tallera will
take the artifacts and leave you
here, to be captured by Starfleet.
I've served on this ship for
almost a year now... fought by
your sides... protected you from
Baran when I could... and now I've
exposed a spy in our midst.
I think I've proven my loyalty.
You know Tallera... you know she's
a woman of great patience. She's
bided her time and waited for this
moment. All she cares about is
assembling that weapon. If she
leaves this ship you'll never see
her again.
I don't care what it is you want,
Tallera. I don't care if that's
a weapon for your private use or
if you're really just making a
delivery as planned. All I care
about is my money.
So I propose a compromise. Narik
and I will go with you to the
surface to guarantee we receive
payment. After that, you can go
wherever you want.
Agreed.
Bring him as well. We can use him
as a hostage if Starfleet
arrives... if not we'll kill him
on the surface.
There. Your reward as promised.
Is it all there?
No. This is less than half of
what we were promised.
Where is the rest of it?
That is all I could manage. I
suggest you take it and leave.
I did not come this far to be
cheated. I want it all. Now.
Very well. You will get what you
deserve.
Go ahead, Captain. Pick up the
phaser. See what good it will do.
You can't win, Tallera. Starfleet
won't stand by while you tear
apart one of the founding worlds
of the Federation.
How little you understand what you
are facing, Captain.
You are used to fighting enemies
like yourself... people on ships
with energy weapons, defense
shields, warp drives... but this
is unlike anything you have ever
faced. This is the power of the
mind.
Pick up the phaser, Captain.
Drop your weapons! Do it!
Make no aggressive movements. The
resonator amplifys violent
thoughts and emotions.
That's why you wanted me to take
the phaser -- and why you were
able to kill Narik and Vekor. It
wasn't until I saw the image on
the last artifact... that I
realized what the message on the
resonator was.
The third image is the Vulcan
symbol for peace... that symbol is
positioned between the symbols for
war and death.
It's a warning... that the
resonator's power can be overcome
by peace.
You're about to see how wrong you
are.
Clear your minds of all aggressive
thoughts...
No...
Think, Tallera -- two thousand
years ago, your people were being
consumed by war... then they found
the way of peace and logic.
During the same period, the
resonator was dismantled... don't
you see the connection?
When peace came to Vulcan, the
resonator became useless. That is
why it was dismantled.
You were right... the resonator
cannot be stopped with phasers or
shields. But like every other
form of violence... it can be
stopped with peace.
Captain's Log: Stardate 47169.2.
Security Minister Satok has taken
Tallera into custody and begun a
search for the rest of the
isolationists.
Once we realized you weren't on
the mercenary ship, we scanned the
surface for your neural implant...
and tracked the signal to the
cavern.
What will happen to the resonator?
Satok assured me that all three
pieces will be destroyed.
It is unfortunate that it cannot
be studied. The resonator is a
key artifact from a remarkable
period of history.
Normally, I would be the first to
agree with you... but perhaps
there are some things best left in
the past.
What's going to happen to the
mercenaries?
They have been detained by the
Vulcan authorities, for the
moment.
But they're also facing charges
from the Klingons, the
Cardassians, the Ferengi, and
about seven other worlds. We
won't be hearing from them for
quite some time.
Number One, set course for
Starbase two-twenty-seven. I'll
be on the Bridge shortly.
Wait a minute... You were declared
dead, remember? You can't give
orders around here.
If we are to adhere to the exact
letter of Starfleet regulations,
then technically sir, you have
been declared a renegade. In
fact, I believe you are facing
twelve counts of court martial
offenses. You cannot give orders
either.
Quite right. I'm going to get
some sleep. In the meantime I
suggest you escort Commander Riker
to the brig.
Yes, sir.
This way, sir...
Data, he was just joking... you
know that, right? Data?
