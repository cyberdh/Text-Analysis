Captain's log, stardate 44307.3.
I am preparing to leave by
shuttlecraft for Pentarus Five,
where I have been asked to mediate
a dispute among the salenite
miners -- a contentious group
unfortunately prone to violence.
At the same time, I must deal with
a situation of a far more personal
nature.
Ensign, I summoned you almost ten
minutes ago!
Yes, sir, I know, but I was in
the middle of an experiment using
some volatile compounds and I
couldn't just leave them lying
out --
Excuses, Mister Crusher?
No, sir, not at all, it was more
of an explanation --
Because I assure you that will
not go over well at Starfleet
Academy.
I know, sir, but --
The Academy?
I just got the message from
Admiral Nsomeka. She expects
you to report in two weeks.
A position has opened up in this
year's class. You'll have to work
overtime to catch up, but I have
assured the Commander that you
will be capable of that. Please
don't make a liar of me.
Oh, yes sir! I mean -- no, sir.
And as your final mission aboard
the Enterprise... I'd like you
to accompany me to Pentarus while
I try to sort things out with the
miners.
Yes, sir...
Mister Riker tells me you've been
studying the effects of outpost
judiciary decisions on Federation
Law. What better way to get
first-hand experience?
Captain, I am picking up a general
distress signal from Gamelan Five.
On screen.
Please... Does anyone read us?
Open channel.
I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
the Federation Starship
Enterprise.
Captain... I am Chairman Songi,
of Gamelan Four. An unidentified
spacecraft has entered orbit above
our planet. Radiation levels in
our atmosphere have increased by
three thousand percent. We can
only assume we are under attack
-- but the ship will not answer
our hails! We are a peaceful
planet... we have no ability to
defend ourselves. Please, can
you help us?
Mister Data, are we close enough
for a scan?
Nossir, we are out of range.
Any other ships near that system?
Negative, Commander.
Very well. Chairman Songi, we
will proceed immediately to your
planet.
Thank you, Captain Picard...
Mister Riker, take the Enterprise
and investigate the problem.
Ensign Crusher and I will proceed
to Pentarus Five.
The miners have sent a shuttle.
We'll depart in ten minutes.
Your maneuvering thrusters are
rigged in a configuration I
haven't seen before.
My own modification. It's more
efficient. You can study it if
you want...
I've run operational and safety
inspections, Captain. It checks
out. I won't make any claims for
comfort.
Captain Picard... Captain Dirgo,
of the shuttlecraft "Nenebek".
Ah -- Captain. Good to meet you.
"Captain?" Of a mining shuttle?
Yes, Ensign -- Captain. My ship
isn't pretty, and she isn't big
-- but we've logged almost ten
thousand hours together.
It seems a very -- sturdy --
craft.
We should go. Will you take Ops,
Captain?
I'll let Ensign Crusher perform
that task. I need to study up
on Regalian law.
Crusher to Bridge...
Go ahead, Mister Crusher.
Shuttlecraft Nenebek prepared
for departure.
Acknowledged, Ensign. Begin
launch sequence.
Launch sequence confirmed...
Shuttlecraft has cleared the bay.
Ensign Allenby, set a course for
the Gamelan system... Warp Six.
Aye, Sir.
You've done this before.
Yes...
If your Captain isn't tougher than
he looks, those miners will tear
him apart.
Don't worry about Captain Picard
-- he'll handle them.
I've lost navigation --
The port thruster quad is gone,
guidance coupling is severed --
I can't stabilize her!
The port thruster module blew...
Nenebek to Enterprise...
emergency... do you read?
Pentarus station... come in...
Communication is gone --
Is your navigational system
functioning?
Negative. Switching to manual.
Estimated position... ?
Fifty million kilometers from
Pentarus Five... we may have to
put down somewhere else...
Mister Crusher, scan for a class
M environment...
Aye, sir.
We'll lose the main impulse engine
if I don't throttle it down.
One of the moons of Pentarus
Three... it's class M -- barely
-- mean temperature fifty-five
degrees Celsius...
Life forms indicated?
Negative. But sensors are
limited. There's an intense
magnetic field near the surface.
We don't have a choice.
Save the impulse engine for a
controlled entry.
Ensign, reconfigure the working
thrusters to manual inputs.
I'll try, sir -- but this grid
looks about a hundred years old...
I don't have the Federation's
resources...
Captain... will you take the helm?
I'm rerouting the deuterium
flow --
We'll have to manually trip the
bypass from the main engine to
the thrusters...
Where'd you learn that?
We've got power reconfigured,
Captain.
Hull temperature seven hundred
degrees --
Beginning braking maneuver.
We're below Mach One! Bypass
to thrusters now!
Let's salvage what we can.
The first thing we'll need is
shelter from the sun. In this
heat, the shuttle will act like
an oven.
All systems are out. Can't get
a communication channel. Location
transponder's gone, too.
We'll have to check the craft for
something to protect our heads
and eyes... and Captain, please
recover your medical supplies...
food and water rations...
The medical supplies are all
right...
But... food and water?
A replicator... damaged beyond
repair.
Surely... you have emergency
supplies.
This isn't a starship! I have
to choose what I carry!
Are you telling me... that we have
no water?
Scanning. Vessel reads as an
unmanned sublight freighter.
Origin?
Indeterminate. Propulsion appears
to employ a gaseous-core fission
reactor, but it is not functioning.
The radiation levels coming from
that ship are off the scale.
Mister Data, could that be
leakage from their engines?
No sir. Engine reactor elements
appear to have been inactive for
approximately three hundred years.
The vessel is carrying various
unstable waste products.
You mean... it's a garbage scow.
Precisely.
Mister Worf, open a hailing
frequency.
Chairman Songi, this is Commander
Riker on board the Enterprise.
Yes, Commander.
It appears you've inherited
someone else's problem... It's
an old waste vessel... caught by
your planet's gravitational pull.
Have your people begun to suffer
from radiation sickness?
Not yet. But some areas are
already detecting dangerous
levels.
We'll do our best to get it out
of here as quickly as possible.
Thank you, Commander.
We're going to give that barge
a push into the Gamelan sun.
Sir, the Meltasion Asteroid Belt
lies between here and the sun.
Then we'll have to take it
ourselves and have our
deflectors clear a safe path
through the asteroids.
I don't like the idea of getting
close enough to that barge to tow
it. The radiation levels are so
high we'd be risking contamination
of the entire crew.
Got a better idea, Geordi?
We could send over a construction
module to attach thrusters to it.
Then we could direct it through
the asteroid belt from a safe
distance.
Commander... a message from the
mining settlement on Pentarus.
The shuttle carrying Captain
Picard has not yet arrived.
They left here at oh-eight-hundred
hours...
They have asked if we will be
starting a search.
Tell them we have an emergency
situation here... we'll start a
search after we've dealt with it.
Aye, sir.
Mister LaForge, prepare to launch
the construction module. Let's
get this over with as fast as we
can.
Mister Crusher, any luck with that
tricorder?
I think so, sir. The scanning
range may be limited, but it's
better than nothing.
These were on board, Captain.
They're working.
Excellent. Now --
Our communicators may not be able
to get a signal through this
strong a magnetic field... so I've
fashioned an arrow. If a search
party finds the wreckage, they'll
know we've headed for those
mountains.
Are you crazy?
It's too far away. We'll never
make it.
We can't survive out here in the
sun.
Where there are mountains, there
is shelter.
You have no right to make the
decisions! I'm Captain of this
ship!
If you want to get out of this,
I suggest you listen. Captain
Picard is the one who's going to
keep us alive --
Thank you, Ensign, that's enough.
Yes, sir.
Captain Dirgo, you're an able
pilot and I welcome your input.
Do you feel there's an alternative
we're overlooking?
No.
Very well. I suggest a steady
pace, but not a brisk one. We
need to ration our energy. Try
to breathe through your nose, it
will help prevent dehydration.
I'll lead... Captain Dirgo, will
you bring up the rear?
And you were worried about how
tough the Captain is?
Did you find water?
No... not yet...
What are you doing with that?
Mister Crusher?
I'm not sure, sir... an energy
reading.
Energy reading? What kind?
Low frequency E-M. It's been
getting stronger... the closer
we get to those mountains.
What are you saying? There's
something over there? Waiting
for us?
I don't know what it is. It just
registers as a repeating energy
pattern...
Ensign, are you suggesting this
energy is not naturally occurring?
The readings could be indicating
some electromagnetic property in
the rocks... but I don't think so.
A life form?
It's possible... the pattern's
fairly organized...
We can't go back... and we can't
stay here. We have to keep going
to the mountains. No matter
what's waiting there.
There has to be water in here...
aren't caves formed by water?
Not necessarily... they could
have been created by volcanic
activity -- lava flows.
These walls are dry... Mister
Crusher, do you get any moisture
reading?
No, sir... But that E-M reading?
The pattern has changed... and
the frequency is peaking a lot
higher...
You have water!
I wouldn't hide water...
It's called dresci... from my
planet.
Alcohol.
It's -- medicinal. For
emergencies.
I was going to share it with
you...
This won't quench your thirst...
it will only make it worse.
I'll take my chances...
I'm not going to let you waste
this. It's more valuable to us
as a coolant or a disinfectant.
It's mine!
Mister Crusher, stow this with
the medical supplies and keep your
eye on it.
Yes, sir.
Now we're going to explore this
cave. Mister Crusher, look for
any indication of water, no matter
how faint. Captain Dirgo -- will
you lead the way?
We're projecting that the bulk
of the radiation will affect three
small island groups.
Fortunately, they're sparsely
populated. We'll start
replicating hyronalin now and be
ready to transport it to them if
it becomes necessary. Please
coordinate with the medical
personnel on the planet.
We've contacted the nearest
Starbase for a search vessel...
I'm afraid the closest one is
almost a week away...
I see. Thank you.
But we have asked the mining
settlement to send out any vessels
they might have.
You know, there are many reasons
why the shuttle might have been
delayed...
Deanna -- thank you. But I'm all
right. And for now, I have work
to do.
Commander... the miners report
that they have very few operable
shuttle craft. They want to know
when we will be joining the
search.
Tell them to stand by. If this
works, we'll be on our way.
Thrusters are attached and ready,
Commander.
Initiate prefire sequence.
Prefire command transmitted.
Thrusters to standby.
Fire thrusters... gradual
acceleration to forty percent
power.
We've lost one module. Correcting
thrust vectors to compensate.
Structural integrity of the barge
has been compromised.
Disintegration is continuing.
Shut down thrusters! Ensign, take
us one thousand meters ahead of
the barge and hold.
External radiation levels are
increasing.
Coming into position at one
thousand meters.
Mister Worf, extend shields around
the ship and lock on a tractor
beam.
Aye, sir.
Warning. Radiation levels at
seventy millirads per minute and
rising.
Allenby, set a new course. We're
going to take it through the
asteroid belt ourselves. One-quarter
impulse.
Aye, sir.
Doctor Crusher to the Bridge.
On my way.
Data... I need a projection of
the radiation impact on the
crew... Worf...
... signal the mining settlement.
Tell them -- we won't be joining
the search for awhile.
There's light up ahead!
Captain... water!
I knew there had to be water!
Mister Crusher... what was that?
It seems to be some kind of
tightly confined annular force
field...
Put there to protect the water.
Then there has to be a way to
de-activate it...
We can with our phasers.
I think it might be wiser if...
The E-M pattern again -- the
power level's really spiking
now...
Look... I think it's working!
Dirgo...
Stop firing!
Help me!
Dirgo -- move!
Keep pressure on that wound!
This is the worst break... ?
What was that thing... ?
Keep the pressure constant.
Ensign... how bad is it?
You have a broken leg... Your
left arm is... I think there's
a fracture there, too. And you
took a bad blow to the head. But
we're getting the bleeding under
control.
Good work... I'm going to be fine
in a moment... just need to catch
my breath...
Tell him the truth.
What truth?
He's bleeding inside. I've seen
it before. He'll never survive.
You don't know what you're talking
about.
You're wasting your time. Save
the dresci for us.
Mister Dirgo -- I'd appreciate
it if you didn't bury me before
I'm gone.
The trouble is... he may be right.
No, he's not -- you're going to
be fine...
Captain... ?
For a moment... I saw your
father's face in yours...
He wouldn't give up, either... even
when things looked bleakest, even
on that terrible afternoon...
Strange, I always remember it as
night. Maybe... sudden,
unnecessary death ought to happen
at night... not on a bright
cloudless afternoon...
Wesley... you're going to have
to keep a rein on Dirgo... he's
willful, stubborn... that could
be dangerous...
You'll handle him, sir.
Listen to me. I have no feeling
in my right leg. My vision is
blurred... I'm going to get worse,
not better. I won't be able to
help you, Wesley. You'll have
to stand up to him on your own.
Yes, sir.
Good man...
First Officer's log, stardate
44307.6. Radiation levels on the
Enterprise continue to rise. The
ventilation system has started
pumping hyronalin into our air
supply to counteract the effects.
At the rate the radiation levels
are increasing, the hyronalin
additive will only be effective
for another thirty-eight minutes.
Crusher to Medical Unit One.
Evacuate and seal off all
non-operational areas. Group the
crew and families in the interior
corridors of decks nine and ten,
radiation exposure protocol.
Acknowledged, Doctor
Data... at our current speed, how
long will it take us to get
through the asteroid belt?
Fifty-one minutes, fourteen
seconds.
We're going to have a lot of
casualties if we can't get there
any faster.
Geordi, how much more can the
tractor beam take?
We're already at the upper limit
for towing speed, Commander.
Then let's see if we can establish
a new upper limit...
Aye, sir...
Data, monitor the shearing effect
on the beam... increasing to
one-half impulse.
Tractor beam is holding...
shearing force eighty metric tons
per meter...
Increasing to three-quarters
impulse.
Shearing force ninety-two metric
tons... ninety-three... tractor
beam is destabilizing... we are
going to lose the barge,
Commander...
Reduce power.
One-half impulse.
Geordi, you gotta stabilize the
tractor beam...
I can't divert any more power
to the shields... we're already
hitting maximum thermal limits...
Only other choice is to bring
some other fusion reactors on
line... but we're running at
peak coolant pressure...
Do it.
Warning. Radiation levels at one
hundred fifty millirads per
minute and rising. Lethal
exposure in thirty-five minutes.
Look at that.
How did this happen?
That -- thing -- did it.
Selenium fibers... electrically
deposited.
The E-M pattern is back down...
it only surged when we tried to
get to the water...
Whatever it was we saw... it
almost acts like a sentry. To
guard the fountain.
As long as we aren't moving toward
the water, the wave pattern stays
low... right between five and
fifteen hertz... Dirgo, walk
toward the fountain.
That's it! The frequency went
to forty.
What is this getting us? We've
got to get to the water!
If I could find a way to
manipulate the frequency, I might
be able to control it.
The Sentry appeared when we
started using phasers. Maybe it
responds to heat... or to
collinated energy...
If you're right... we can use a
phaser to lure it away.
Hold on... we need to figure out
what it is, before we start doing
anything to it.
Enough talk. Enough thinking.
It's time to do something.
I'll start firing. When it comes
-- you fire and draw it off.
No, we can't...
Then set your phaser on automatic
and take cover.
And how do you know it'll go for
my phaser, not yours?
Because... I'll fire mine on the
lowest setting. You use maximum.
There's no evidence that it
responds differently to higher
settings... we have to figure
out our options before we --
And while we're doing that, your
Captain is dying.
With those wounds, most men would
already be dead. If he doesn't
get water...
When I start firing -- you better
do your part.
First Officer's log, supplemental.
Mister LaForge has diverted
power from auxiliary fusion
generators in an attempt to
stabilize the tractor beam. This
is the only hope of increasing
our towing speed so we can clear
the asteroid belt before radiation
levels become fatal.
Warning. Radiation levels at
three hundred millirads per
minute and rising. Lethal
exposure in one minute.
Ready, Commander. I'll be
rotating the output of the
auxiliary reactors, but it should
still give us the power we need.
Proceed, Mister LaForge.
Increasing to three-quarters
impulse.
Shearing force at one hundred
three metric tons... the tractor
beam is stable...
Full impulse.
Tractor beam is holding.
Warning. Lethal radiation
exposure in thirty seconds.
We are in visual range of the
asteroid belt.
On screen.
Warning. Lethal radiation
exposure in fifteen seconds.
Stand by to cut the barge loose...
Warning. Lethal radiation
exposure in ten seconds.
We have cleared the asteroids,
sir.
Let it go.
Radiation intensity is decreasing,
Commander.
Cancel red alert.
Mister Worf, contact the mining
settlement. Tell them we are
joining the search for Captain
Picard.
Ensign, set a new course. Warp
nine.
Cold...
When the sun went down, the
temperature really dropped.
This should help.
... don't seem to be much good
to you, Wesley...
Sir... Dirgo is dead.
I should've tried harder to stop
him...
Sir?
Captain?
Captain Picard!
Sir... please... stay with me...
I'm... trying...
Captain? Remember when we took
the shuttlecraft to Starbase
Five-One-Five? I was dreading
it... six hours alone with you...
But it didn't turn out the way
I thought it would... you kind
of -- opened up to me. I got to
know you.
Sort of.
... it's my fault you're here...
I shouldn't have asked you...
I was honored you wanted me
along...
... I was selfish... knew I might
not see you again... forgive me...
Sir... the past three years...
I've lived more than most people
do in a lifetime...
I think I've been pretty lucky...
no matter what happens. How many
people get to serve with -- with
Jean-Luc Picard?
You don't know this... nobody
knows this, because I never told
anybody... but a lot of what
I've worked for... school, and
science projects, and getting into
the Academy... I've done it
because... because...
Because I wanted you to be proud
of me.
One thing I learned from you...
is that you never quit. And I'm
not quitting now. I've seen you
think yourself out of worse
problems... and I'm going to
think us out of this one.
You're not going to die... I won't
let you die. I'll get to the
water and I'll keep you alive
until they find us. I promise
you.
Are you certain?
It is definitely debris. The
primary material is duranium, with
smaller proportions of sonodanite
and ermanium.
Most shuttlecraft hulls are made
of duranium.
Then, they're gone.
Not necessarily, Doctor. There
is far too little debris to
account for an entire
shuttlecraft.
So what is it?
Dirgo had his maneuvering
thrusters rigged in a funny way...
he claimed it was more efficient.
If one of them blew... it might
have left debris like that.
If only one of his thrusters were
out... he could still have put
down somewhere.
The only Class M planets in the
system are Pentarus Two and
Five... both have been
thoroughly searched by the miners.
Then, we'll search them again.
Sir... there are also four moons
in the Pentarus system that might
support life...
Have the miners searched them?
Not yet, sir.
What's the closest one to the
debris coordinates?
Lambda Paz, one of the moons of
Pentarus Three.
Set a course, Ensign.
Ensign... where are we?
We crashed, sir... we're in a
cave...
... need water...
We -- we don't have any water.
Don't you remember? We tried to
get to the fountain... and Captain
Dirgo...
Yes... I remember...
But I think I'm on to something.
I've analyzed the sentry's
electrical patterns.
Wesley... I may not make it...
I'm going to get to the water...
I took the transponder element
from my communicator... used it
to modify the tricorder...
I think I can use it to interrupt
the sentry's energy pattern...
stop it.
Or at least slow it down...
Listen to me...
Yes, sir?
So much I've wanted to tell you.
At the Academy, there is
someone... who meant a great deal
to me... he has been there
"forever"... you must get to know
him... his name is Boothby... tell
him we were friends...
When I was there... he helped
me... Listen to him...
What does he teach?
He's the groundskeeper. One of
the wisest men I ever knew...
I envy you, Wesley... it is just
the beginning of the adventure
for you.
Go on, get the water, stay
alive... they'll find you.
I'll be back soon.
Wesley...
Always remember... I was... proud
of you...
It worked... !
Captain Picard? Wake up...
There is an intense magnetic
field, Commander. I am getting
an anomalous reading... but it
is not strong enough to interpret
accurately.
I can narrow the frequency range
on the sensor array... and try
to enhance the signal...
Any better, Data?
Yes. The reflection signature
now clearly indicates that it is
metal... duranium. The probablity
is quite high that it is the
shuttlecraft.
Any life signs?
It is impossible to determine.
The magnetic flux would mask any
bio-energy emanations.
Mister Worf, will that
interference affect the
Transporter Beam?
Yes, Commander. An Away Team
would have to take a
shuttlecraft.
Assemble your team, Mister Data.
I'm going with you.
Of course. Lieutenant Worf?
Wesley?
Mom!
Oh, Wesley... thank God...
I'm sure glad to see you...
How did you find us?
We found the wreckage -- and the
arrow which indicated your
direction.
We'll take Wesley by stretcher,
too.
I can walk.
Beverly...
We're on our way back to the
Enterprise, Captain... we've
stabilized your vital signs.
Mister Crusher...
A moment...
I want you all to know...
He saved my life...
Wesley, know this... you will be
missed.
