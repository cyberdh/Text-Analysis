Report.
There's an object of some kind
closing in on our position.
On screen.
It appears to be an unmanned probe --
approximately half a meter in
diameter. It has no identifiable
armaments.
We are being hailed...
You are being hailed, sir -- by
name.
Open a channel.
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
the --
I am reading a power surge --
Shields up.
The beam appears to contain
holographic imaging information...
It's trying to project
something...
Isolate the bandwidth and let the
signal through the shields.
Bok...
I trust you remember me, Picard,
because I haven't forgotten you...
or how you murdered my son...
For fifteen years I've thought
about how to avenge his death...
but nothing I could do to you
could equal what you did to me...
until now.
You thought you could hide him
from me, didn't you? But I found
out about him... Jason Vigo is as
good as dead.
I'm going to kill your son,
Picard, just like you killed
mine...
Put a tractor beam on that probe
and determine if it's safe to beam
it aboard. I want to know where
it came from.
Mister Data, see if there's any
mention of a Jason Vigo in
Federation records.
You might start with Miranda Vigo --
she was born on New Gaul about
forty years ago...
Yes, sir.
Contact the Ferengi Government and
find out what you can about Bok.
He was wearing a Daimon's uniform --
if he's regained his rank, I want
to know why.
Come.
The Ferengi Government is debating
an amendment to the Rules of
Acquisition...
-- it might be a while before they
get back to us...
Data found out that the woman you
mentioned does have a son named
Jason.
This is the most recent picture we
could find.
How old is the boy now?
Twenty three.
He and his mother left Earth about
six years ago and settled on Camor
Five. That's all we know, the
planet's records are practically
non-existent.
Picard to Bridge. Set course for
the Camor system, warp five.
Aye, sir.
Wil... I appreciate your not
asking, but you have the right to
know...
There is a possibility that the
boy is my son... I was involved
with his mother for a short time
about twenty four years ago. I
met her through a friend during
shore-leave on Earth. It was all
very romantic...
-- probably because we both knew
I'd be leaving in two weeks... we
kept in touch for a short while,
but we never managed to get
together again...
And she never said anything about
being pregnant... ?
No... either Bok's got it wrong
and I'm not the father, or Miranda
decided she wanted to raise the
child on her own. Quite frankly
it wouldn't surprise me. She was
very independent... very strong-willed...
You'd have to be to get by on
Camor Five.
Whether he's really my son or not,
the fact is he's in danger. Bok
tried to kill me six years ago...
I have no doubt he intends to make
good on his threat against the
boy...
Anything?
There are no Ferengi vessels
within range of our scanners...
Captain, I have been unable to
find any information about Jason
Vigo's current whereabouts...
What about his mother's?
No, sir.
Miranda was trained as a
botanist... she used to talk
about running a farm some day. We
might start with the agricultural
areas.
That would significantly narrow
our search; the only cultivated
land is on the southern continent,
and there are relatively few
people engaged in agricultural
activities.
There can't be too many non-Camorites
among them. Try
scanning for human life-signs.
I am detecting seven humans...
three are female... however they
are all too young to be Miranda
Vigo.
What about males?
One is an infant... another is
elderly... and two are middleaged.
That's seven, you said there were
eight humans.
I am having difficulty getting a
clear reading on the eighth...
-- the individual appears to be
located approximately two
kilometers beneath the planet's
surface.
Male or female?
Male... adult... between twenty
and thirty years old.
No one in their right mind would
go that far underground alone.
Unless he was forced to.
Sir, I am reading seismic
instability in the area. He is in
danger.
Relay his coordinates to the
Transporter Room and have them
beam him aboard.
What the... ?
This is a Federation ship...
That's right. I'm Captain
Picard... Jean-Luc Picard.
I realize I wasn't supposed to be
spelunking that cave, but don't
you have something better to do?
We thought you were in danger.
Oh... well... I wasn't. Maybe you
should just beam me back where I
was?
Are you Jason Vigo?
I... know him. Is he in trouble?
In a manner of speaking...
someone's made a threat against
his life.
Jason... I'm an old friend of your
Mother's. I came here because
you're in danger.
Why would anyone want to kill me?
The person who made the threat is
under the impression that... that
you are my son...
Am I... ?
I don't know...
My mother never told me who my
father was... just that he was in
Starfleet.
Perhaps we should contact her... ?
She... died a few years ago...
I'm sorry...
Jason... I think it's important
that we find out one way or
another. Would you be willing to
permit a genetic test?
If I'm not your son... is this
person still going to want to kill
me?
Once he's made aware of the fact,
I expect he won't...
In that case you won't mind my
saying that I hope you're not my
father...
What were you doing down in that
cave? Are you a seismologist?
No, I just enjoy climbing.
Without an antigrav harness... ?
They get in the way...
So... what do you do?
I'm... between jobs right now.
I see...
Excuse me, gentlemen, but I have
the results if you want to hear
them.
Your genetic code is a cross
between the DNA of your mother,
Miranda Vigo, and your father --
Jean-Luc Picard.
What is all this... ?
Archaeological fragments I've
collected over the years...
This is a Silvan glyph stone...
And this is a Gorlan prayer
stick... it's extremely rare...
Is it valuable... ?
Not really. Only to students of
archaeology like myself. Still,
I had to give up a very old bottle
of Saurian brandy for it.
I'd say you got taken.
Perhaps... but I value it
nonetheless...
On Camor, something has value if
you can eat it or sell it...
everything else is a luxury.
Would you like some tea?
No. Thanks.
Something else?
Tea, Earl Grey, hot.
Well. I'm sure this whole thing
is as much a surprise to you as it
is to me...
I'll be honest with you, Jason.
I was with your mother for only a
short time. I would like to have
known her better... but it didn't
work out that way.
You look a lot like her -- it's
your eyes, I think...
I want to be clear about one thing --
your mother didn't tell me about
you. If she had... I would have
been part of your life.
I guess that's not what she
wanted.
I think I'd like to go back to the
surface.
It would be best if you stayed
aboard the Enterprise... until we
can resolve the situation with
Bok.
What is the situation with Bok,
anyway? Why does he want me dead?
Years ago, I was forced to destroy
a starship that was under his
son's command. Apparently Bok
feels it would be fitting
vengeance to kill my son.
I can't hide forever.
Of course not. We're trying to
locate Bok... I intend to confront
him, settle this matter.
How long will that take?
I assure you -- no one's more
eager to get this behind us than
I am.
Where do I stay?
We'll give you quarters.
Okay. Let's go.
Jason... your being here... I hope
it will give us the chance to get
to know each other.
We managed to shut down the
probe's power systems so we could
beam it aboard, but it's not going
to be easy to figure out where it
came from.
Bok took the precaution of
encrypting the probe's
navigational systems so that we
would be unable to decipher its
flight path.
We ran an analysis of the probe's
hull -- from the energy signatures
and particle deposits we found, it
looks like it travelled through a
Dichromic Nebula, was exposed to
an intensive gravimetric
distortion, and passed within a
light year of a class four pulsar.
Those phenomena are relatively
common -- we would need to
identify at least one of them
specifically in order to postulate
a flight path.
Understood.
Sir, incoming message from Daimon
Birta.
On screen.
Thank you for taking the time to
talk to us, Daimon.
I understand you have a problem.
Yes, it concerns Daimon Bok.
Bok is no Daimon. He was relieved
of command six years ago -- he was
unstable, dangerous. We had to
confine him to Rog Prison.
But he's no longer there?
He was able to buy himself out
about two years ago.
Buy himself out?
He paid his debt to society.
Considering that he is dangerous
and unstable, I trust you've kept
track of him?
He's a private citizen. We take
no responsibility for him.
I see. Do you have any idea of
his present whereabouts?
I understand he was seen in the
Dorias cluster not too long ago...
That cluster consists of over
twenty star systems...
You don't have to thank me,
Captain.
Believe it or not, sir -- that
might've given us the fix we
needed. There's a nebula in the
Dorias cluster that matches the
particle signature we found on the
probe.
There is a class four pulsar three
light years from the nebula -- my
calculations indicate that the
probe was launched in the Xendi
Kabu system.
Plot a course and take us out of
orbit.
Jean-Luc... come in.
I think I need to talk to a
parent.
What's he like?
I'm not sure I can tell you. He's
put up so many barriers... I don't
really know what's underneath.
It would certainly be
understandable if he couldn't
accept you right away...
I can't imagine that he'll ever
accept me. He won't even talk to
me.
Keep in mind... he's had twenty
years to be angry that his father
wasn't there... it'll take time to
get over those feelings -- but I
think it's possible.
Perhaps. But surely it would be
wrong of me to force the issue.
He's made it clear he doesn't want
to pursue a relationship... I
believe I should respect his
feelings.
Of course you want to take your
cues from him... move slowly...
but you might want to keep trying
to get through those barriers.
What I sense about this young
man... is that he's very
independent.
I think it's best if I leave him
alone. Let him come to me if he
wants.
Maybe you're right.
I just think you should consider
one thing.
Are you really thinking about
what's best for Jason... or
easiest for you?
Yeah...
Hello, Jason. I'm Deanna Troi...
the ship's Counselor.
Come in...
Did Captain Picard ask you to come
talk to me?
No... I just came to see how you
were doing. A lot's happened in
the last few hours... I thought
you might want to talk about it.
I'll be all right...
People have wanted to kill me
before...
But you've never met your father
before.
I have to admit I never thought I
would.
It must be somewhat
overwhelming...
I am a little shaky.
Of course. That's only natural.
But you know what? Just talking
to you... I feel better already.
How did you feel about the Captain --
about your father?
He's okay. A little stiff.
Where are you from?
I was born on Betazed...
Do all the women there have eyes
like yours?
Jason... I came here to talk to
you because I'm the ship's
counselor... if you don't want to
talk to me in that way, I think I
should go.
Fine...
You're welcome to make an
appointment to come by my office.
Maybe I'll do just that.
Picard... can you hear me?
I will kill him, Picard. And
there's nothing you can do about
it.
Security to Captain's quarters.
Our shields were up; how could he
have beamed through them?
I don't think he did. Sensor logs
don't show any sign of an
intruder.
Could it have been another
hologram?
I don't think so... something has
to generate a hologram -- we would
have detected it.
Bok once used a mind control
device to make me hallucinate.
That device gave off a very
specific energy signature... I'm
not reading anything like it.
Could he have modified the device
so he could use it without being
detected?
It's possible... I'll recalibrate
the sensors to scan for low
intensity transmissions. And just
to be sure, I'll sweep your
quarters with a resonance scanner.
Good. Keep me posted.
I want you to assign a security
detail to Jason.
What about yourself?
I'm not the target of Bok's
threats. Jason is.
Captain, I have compiled all
available records pertaining to
Jason Vigo's criminal record, and --
His criminal record?
Yes, sir. He has been charged
three times for petty theft, twice
for disorderly conduct, and
several dozen times for
trespassing.
Trespassing?
I believe the charges were related
to his climbing activities in the
caves underneath the planet's
surface.
This is the information you
requested, is it not?
Yes, thank you.
What was your name again?
Lieutenant Rhodes.
Actually, I meant your first name.
Sandra...
Well, Sandra... do you think you
could give me some room?
We're supposed to be keeping an
eye on you.
Don't you think you can keep an
eye on me from over there?
Good morning...
I thought you said your ship was
the safest place I could be.
Why the guards?
Because... Bok appeared in my
quarters last night.
It may not have been Bok -- just
an image of him. We're
investigating.
Look, maybe you should just drop
me off somewhere and let me watch
out for myself.
I don't think that's wise...
I've been doing it since I was
fifteen.
I know you have. But Bok is
extremely dangerous. He has a
starship, technology --
All right, all right. I'll stay
here.
You seem to enjoy rock climbing.
Our Holodeck can create some very
challenging climbs.
Why don't I take you down there
and show you how to use the
programs?
Thanks. But I can figure it out
myself.
Perhaps we could do a climb
together...
I'm probably not as skilled as
you, but I'm not inexperienced.
I kind of prefer to climb alone.
Of course.
There are other sports programs...
fending, for example. Have you
ever fenced?
Hardly.
I think it might appeal to you.
It's very physical... demanding --
Look... I'm sorry...
I appreciate what you're trying to
do. But Captain --
Captain, father, Jean-Luc -- I
don't even know what I'm supposed
to call you... after this thing
with Bok is over, I'm leaving. So
when you think about it, there's
really not much point in our
getting acquainted.
Let me know when you catch him,
all right?
Captain's Log, Stardate 47829.1.
We've been in the Xendi Kabu
system for over three hours, and
still no sign of Bok.
I have completed a subspace
scan... there is an energy
residual that suggests that a
Ferengi vessel, possibly several,
was in this area within the last
eighteen hours.
La Forge to Bridge.
Go ahead.
I've scanned your quarters, sir...
I haven't been able to find
anything that would explain Bok's
appearance.
Understood.
Captain, I am detecting an object
five thousand kilometers off our
starboard bow -- it is another
probe.
Why didn't we detect it before?
It must have been cloaked, sir --
it appeared out of nowhere.
On screen.
Another holographic device?
I do not believe so, sir.
Captain, the probe's systems are
overloading.
Red alert. Shields up!
Damage report.
No damage, sir.
Captain, I do not believe it was
meant as an attack, but rather as
a message.
A message?
In B'Zal, a Ferengi code which
uses an alternating pattern of
light and darkness.
Can you translate it?
I am attempting to do so...
The message appears to read: "My
revenge is at hand."
He's proved he can get to us
whenever he wants. What's he
waiting for?
Tea, earl grey -- hot.
If you want me to stay and talk
you'd better not call for security
this time...
How do you like your boy, Captain?
Is he everything you'd always
hoped for?
It's a risky game you're playing,
coming here. Next time we'll be
ready for you. Why don't we
settle this now?
How do you propose to do that,
Picard? You murdered my son.
It was self-defense. He fired on
my ship.
You were in Ferengi space!
I didn't know that. If he'd told
me I would have withdrawn.
I'm sorry, but there's nothing I
can do to bring him back.
How touching. But your apology is
worthless to me. And I demand
that you repay me for my loss.
You can't put a price on a life.
Oh, but you can, Picard. You can
pay me with your son's life.
No...
I'm afraid you don't have any
choice. I insist on being paid...
That should do it, but let's run
a level-three bio-scan just to be
sure.
Rhodes to Sickbay! Medical
emergency -- deck nine, section
four!
Have you ever had a seizure like
this before?
Not really... sometimes my hands
shake... but it's never been that
bad.
When did it first start to happen?
A few months ago... do you have
any idea what's wrong with me?
You have a condition called
Forrester-Trent syndrome. It's a
degenerative neurological disorder --
very rare.
What do you mean degenerative?
If it goes untreated, it can lead
to paralysis... even death. I'm
starting you on a neuro-stabilization
regimen. If we're
lucky, we should be able to halt
the degeneration, maybe even
reverse it.
The disease is hereditary.
I know your father doesn't have
it... was your mother prone to
seizures?
Not that I know of.
There have been a few reported
cases where the disease was
instigated by random mutation...
I'll run a micro-cellular scan to
see if that's what happened.
In the meantime, I want you to
take it easy, get some rest.
Is he going to be all right... ?
I wish I could say for certain.
There's no way to know how he'll
respond to the treatment.
Is there any... facility we can
take him to -- where they might
have special expertise?
I'm afraid there isn't. But I'll
do everything I can.
I know you will... I'm sorry.
It's just hard for me to accept
that there's nothing I can do...
I understand...
I've been thinking about what you
said the other day. You were
right, you know. I convinced
myself Jason didn't want me to
reach out to him...
Because I don't have the faintest
idea how to do it.
I don't think anyone is born
knowing how to be a parent. You
kind of figure it out as you go.
But nothing I try seems to work.
I think anyone who's had a child
can relate to that.
If there's one quality parenthood
tends to require -- it's patience.
I'm just not sure that's going to
be enough in his case.
I found out he has a criminal
record. Nothing terribly serious --
petty theft, that sort of thing --
but... he's a grown man. Is it
too late for him to turn around?
That's really up to him.
Maybe. But you can't blame
yourself for not having been
there. All you can do is be there
for him now.
And be patient.
And be patient.
I think we've found something...
Bok was in direct contact with
this chair for an extended
period... it is showing a
distinctive subspace signature as
a result.
We think he's using some sort
of... subspace transporter to
beam aboard the Enterprise.
My understanding is that such
devices were impractical.
The Federation abandoned its
research in the field because the
technology was found to be
unreliable... as well as extremely
energy intensive.
In order to transport matter
through subspace, you have to put
it into a state of quantum flux --
it's very unstable.
The quantum effect would explain
why our sensors did not detect
Bok's presence.
It would also explain why he was
able to penetrate our shields.
What range would this kind of
transporter have?
In theory it could operate over
several light years.
That means the probe that exploded
could have been beamed into
position from some point outside
sensor range.
If Bok uses his transporter again,
we may be able to trace the
subspace signature and locate his
ship.
Is there any way to keep him from
beaming aboard the Enterprise
again?
I don't think there is...
If he has the ability to beam
aboard, he might be able to beam
someone away.
It is a possibility.
I'm concerned that he's going to
try to take Daniel -- is there any
way we can protect him?
We could keep a signal lock on him
at all times... if Bok tried to
beam him away, we might be able to
keep him from getting a pattern
lock.
In order to do so, we would have
to tie the ship's subspace field
coils into the transporter system.
Make it so.
Open.
Would you mind waiting outside?
Not bad...
I like climbing. There's
something about... literally
having your fate in your own
hands.
I know.
I came to tell you that we may
have found a way to locate Bok's
ship... this might be over soon.
You came all the way up here just
to tell me that?
I thought it might make you feel
better.
Thanks.
That was nice of you.
Jason... after your mother and I
parted... I lost track of her
completely.
I'd like to know more about what
happened to her... if you don't
mind telling me.
Like what?
Well... why did you go to Camor?
It seems an unlikely place for a
woman and a child...
You know what she was like...
See a stray cat -- take it in.
See someone cold -- give them your
coat.
That was Miranda, all right.
She heard about the children on
Camor who'd been orphaned during
the Cardassian war.
I see...
I was only ten when we went there.
I remember her telling me about
all the boys and girls who didn't
have anybody to take care of
them...
So she found this big house...
practically falling apart... and
started rounding up children.
Eventually, there were over forty
of them...
She called it a school. She got
up before dawn and she went to bed
after midnight and in between she
never stopped working. She taught
everyone to read... she grew
vegetables in hardpan to feed
us... and she made sure we knew
how to sing.
That was important in a place like
Camor...
Then one day... two men attacked
her... on the street in broad
daylight... for the food she was
carrying...
If she'd just given it to them,
they probably wouldn't have hurt
her. But she knew we needed the
food...
So they killed her.
I'm sorry...
Don't be sorry for me. My mother
made sure we were all tough enough
to make it.
Jason... isn't there some way I
can be a father to you?
My father and I were estranged...
he thought I should stay home and
tend the vineyards and I wanted to
join Starfleet. He died before we
could come to terms about it...
and I've regretted that all my
life.
I don't want the same thing to
happen to us.
Don't you understand? I'm not
anyone you'd want for a son.
Trust me -- if you knew anything
about me, you wouldn't be trying
so hard.
That's not so...
No? Well let me spell it out for
you. I've been in trouble since
I was a teenager... I steal, I
lie, I use people. I'm a
criminal. That's what your son
is.
I know.
I'm aware of your trouble with the
Camor authorities.
You are?
It doesn't change anything.
You're still my son. And, like it
or not, I'm your father. I don't
know what that means, but I know
it means something. That we're...
connected...
Yes...
At the very least...
-- I know you'll never look at
your hairline the same way again.
Come on -- let's get to the top of
this thing...
You wanted to see me?
It's about Jason...
I finished the micro-cellular scan
I was running... there's something
you need to know...
Sir... sensors detect a subspace
carrier wave heading toward the
ship...
-- its signature is consistent
with Bok's transporter.
Can you tell what part of the ship
it's headed toward?
Not yet, Commander.
See if you can track the signature
and locate Bok's ship.
Geordi, are you ready down there?
I've got a signal lock on Jason.
Riker to Captain --
Picard, here.
Bok is trying to use his
transporter.
The transporter beam is focusing
on deck nine, section four.
Jason's quarters...
I'm on it, Commander.
What's wrong?
Security to Bridge -- Bok is
beaming Jason off the ship!
Initiating transport, now --
I'm losing his signal...
Bok's re-establishing his lock...
Have you been able to locate Bok's
ship?
No, sir. The subspace signature
left by his transporter is
decaying more rapidly than
predicted -- it may not be
possible to trace it.
Sir, another probe has
materialized five hundred
kilometers to starboard...
-- it is sending a transmission.
On screen.
This is a very special day,
Picard. Fifteen years ago you
took my son away from me... today,
I will take yours away from you.
It will be... our anniversary.
I wanted you to see him one last
time... so you could cherish his
memory forever...
I have traced the transporter beam
Bok used to send the probe -- His
ship is holding position
approximately three hundred
billion kilometers from here...
Plot a course -- maximum warp.
Even at warp nine we won't get
there for almost twenty minutes...
The modifications you made to our
Transporter... is there any way
you could try a subspace transport
from here and get me aboard Bok's
ship?
It may be possible, but it would
not be advisable.
You're with me.
You know... if you're trying to
make Captain Picard suffer,
killing me won't do it.
We didn't exactly hit it off. I
think I'm something of an
embarrassment to him.
You're lying. Picard would never
reject his own son.
I mean it -- he cares more about
his crew than he does about me.
You are a clever young man. But
I do not believe that Picard will
be unaffected by your death.
Daimon... if you kill him, the
human will not pay the ransom.
He will... Picard won't know the
boy is dead until it's too late...
Yes, Daimon...
There... I've aligned the field
coils...
The phase dampers are in synch...
standing by to modulate the
transport pattern...
Sir, we might be able to get you
over there, but I don't see how
we're going to get you back.
We'll deal with that when the time
comes.
The transport is going to take
longer than normal... we're going
to have to shunt your pattern
through the subspace field
coils...
Understood...
Initiating transport sequence...
now...
Look... maybe we could make a
deal.
What kind of deal?
Tell my father you killed me...
Put a phaser burn on my shirt and
send it to him. He'll think I'm
dead. That's what's important,
isn't it?
I have friends on Camor Five
who'll make it worth your while.
I understand your desire to live.
But I want Picard to see your body --
so there will be no doubt.
Lower your weapons or Bok is
dead...
Lower yours... or your son dies.
You know as well as I do, Bok...
he's not my son.
I know what you did... Miranda
Vigo is Jason's mother... but, I
am not his father... it only
appeared as if I were because you
resequenced his DNA...
But your technique was flawed...
Jason began to suffer from a
neurological disorder... when my
ship's Doctor investigated its
cause, she discovered what you'd
done...
Now he'll never pay the ransom...
There was never going to be any
ransom. All Bok has ever cared
about was vengeance.
Is this true, Daimon?
He is no longer a Daimon -- he was
stripped of command.
They had no right to do that to
me.
He lied to you so you'd help him
carry out his plan.
The Enterprise is closing in on
your position... if you let us
both go now, you won't be
attacked.
Your crew won't attack -- not
while you're on board.
They'll cripple your vessel and
keep you here until the Ferengi
authorities arrive.
You'll have a great deal of
explaining to do... your only hope
is to turn Bok over to them and
tell them that he deceived you.
There is no profit in this for
us...
Captain's Log, Stardate 47831.8.
At Jason's request, the Enterprise
has returned to Camor Five.
Doctor Crusher said I'm responding
well to the treatment... she
thinks the damage is going to be
completely reversed...
I'm glad to hear it...
Are you sure you wouldn't like to
stay aboard the Enterprise for a
few more days?
I can't... I have a life on
Camor...
-- it's a bit of a mess, but I
want to go back and try to
straighten things out...
I understand...
Well...
Maybe... next time you come back
this way, you can look me up...
I will...
I slipped a little something into
your bag while you were packing...
I know you'd prefer a bottle of
Saurian brandy... but this is all
I could come up with.
I... I can't accept this...
I want you to have it...
Energize...
