I don't know why they have to do
this every year. In fact, I
thought last year the teachers
agreed not to do this anymore.
Captain Picard Day is one of the
children's favorite school
activities. They look forward to
it all year.
Why does it have to be me?
You're the Captain... children
look up to you... you're a role
model for them.
Their perception of me is a
little... exaggerated.
"I don't know... I think this
bears a certain resemblance.
Wouldn't you agree, Number One?"
Don't you have something else to
do?
I'll be on the Bridge.
The finalists will be here in half
an hour. You have to pick first,
second and third place and four
honorable mentions.
Worf to Captain. Incoming
transmission from Admiral
Blackwell. It is coded priority
one.
Put it through.
Excuse me, Counselor.
Admiral.
Captain. What is your status?
We're conducting an energy output
study of the Mekoria Quasar. All
systems normal, the ship is fully
operational.
Good. I'm postponing the quasar
study for the moment. The
Enterprise is to rendezvous with
the starship Crazy Horse in sector
one-six-zero-seven immediately.
You're authorized to exceed warp
speed limitations for the duration
of this assignment.
I understand. What is our
assignment?
I'd prefer not to discuss it over
subspace channels. The Crazy
Horse will be carrying someone
from Starfleet Intelligence...
he'll brief you when he arrives.
Very well.
"Captain Picard Day?"
Oh... yes. It's for the
children... I'm a... role model.
I'm sure you are. Starfleet out.
So who won the contest?
Paul Menegay -- seven years old.
He did an interesting clay
sculpture of my head.
Is that the lumpy one with the
orange skin?
Yes.
Oh, you'll be interested to know
that I've arranged for a Commander
Riker day next month. I'm even
considering making an entry
myself.
Great.
Energize.
Wil. Bet you never thought you'd
see me again.
It's... good to see you, sir.
Sure it is. You look like you're
about to faint.
No... it's just been so long
and...
I'm sorry. Captain Jean-Luc
Picard, Admiral Erik Pressman.
Pressman? Oh, of course. You
were Wil's first commanding
officer... on the Pegasus.
That's right. As a matter of
fact, it's the Pegasus which has
brought me here.
Sir?
The Pegasus is still out there,
Wil. The Romulans found her.
As some of you may know, the
starship Pegasus was lost in this
sector twelve years ago along with
most of its crew. I was the
captain and Commander Riker here
was my helmsman.
I remember reading about it. The
ship was destroyed by a... warp
core breach as I recall.
That's right. The Captain and I,
along with seven others managed to
get to an escape pod before the
breach became critical.
From space, we saw what appeared
to be a matter/anti-matter
explosion which vaporized the
ship.
No wreckage was ever found, so
Starfleet officially listed the
ship as destroyed.
However, all that changed three
days ago. Starfleet Intelligence
has an operative in the Romulan
High Command. He sent us a
message that a Romulan warbird had
located a piece of debris in the
Devolin system which was
positively identified as being
from the Pegasus. The Warbird was
then ordered to locate the rest of
the ship, if possible, and retrieve
it.
Why would the Romulans try to
salvage pieces of a twelve year-old
starship?
The Pegasus was a prototype...
experimental engine... new weapon
systems... some of our designs
were even used in constructing the
Enterprise. There're a lot of
things on board the Romulans would
love to get their hands on.
What are our orders?
We have to find the ship before
the Romulans do... salvage it if
possible... destroy it if
necessary. You'll command the
Enterprise while I remain in
overall command of the mission.
We'll need metallurgical and
chromographic specs on the Pegasus
in order to set up the proper
search parameters.
I'll make the appropriate
information available to you.
Very well.
Set course for the Devolin system.
Aye, sir.
We are approaching the Devolin
system, Captain.
Any sign of the Romulans?
No, sir.
Oh, they're out there... they're
just waiting to see what you're
going to do.
Mister La Forge?
There's an awful lot of ionizing
radiation in this system, Captain.
That, combined with the sheer
amount of rock is going to slow
down our search.
How slow?
Well, I'd say at least--
Sir. Romulan Warbird decloaking
directly ahead.
They're powering weapons.
Red alert. Raise shields. Standby
phasers.
Sir... they are hailing us.
On screen.
I am Commander Sirol of the
Romulan vessel Terix. To whom do
I have the honor of speaking?
I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
the Federation starship
Enterprise.
Captain Picard... I've heard so
much about you. It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.
I hope our sudden appearance
didn't startle you.
Not at all. But an... unannounced
appearance like this could have
unfortunate consequences. It
would be a shame if your ship were
damaged during such a...
misunderstanding.
I am touched by your concern for
my ship. But I doubt we were ever
in any danger.
May I ask what you are doing in
this system?
I could ask you the same question.
We are conducting a survey of
gaseous anomalies.
How interesting. So are we.
Perhaps we could combine our
efforts and share our findings.
I doubt our objectives are...
compatible.
You are probably right.
This has been a most pleasant
conversation... but we must
return to our research.
Then I won't keep you.
They are moving off... resuming
their tachyon scans of the system.
Stand down from Red Alert, but
continue to track their movements,
Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Commander, how long will it take
to search the system?
At least seven days, sir.
And the Romulans have a two day
head start.
Then we better get to it. Mister
Data?
Initiating sensor sweep of grid
zero one.
How long have you had the beard?
About four years. I think I just
got tired of hearing how "young"
I looked.
What was it that Lieutenant Boylen
used to call you?
Ensign Babyface.
You never did have much sense of
humor.
I like to think I've loosened up
in my old age.
Really?
I've been known to tell a joke or
two.
It's about time. You were always
so serious on the Pegasus.
We went through some... serious
times.
Do you really think we'll find the
Pegasus?
I wouldn't have come all the way
out here if I didn't.
And what about our... experiment?
Do you think we'll find that too?
Maybe.
You know... I still think about
what happened... about that last
day.
So do I. It's not the kind of
thing you just forget about.
Do you ever... wonder whether we
did the right thing?
Never. It was a tragedy, yes.
But it wasn't your fault and it
wasn't mine. What we were doing
was for the good of the
Federation. We can't blame
ourselves because the others
couldn't see that.
I know... but maybe we went about
it the wrong way.
Well, this time we may have a
chance to do it the right way. If
this mission is successful... if
we do find the Pegasus and our
"experiment"... we can finish
what we started twelve years ago.
You want to try again?
It's not just me.
The Chief of Starfleet Security
has personally assured me of her
complete support.
Admiral Raner... ? How many other
people know about this?
Not many. And it's up to us to
make sure it stays that way.
Raner gave me written orders for
you... you'll find them coded in
the Enterprise computer. You've
been instructed not to reveal the
true nature of our mission to
anyone, not even Captain Picard.
Don't worry... it won't be like it
was twelve years ago. This time,
no one's going to stop us.
... as a matter of fact, I never
met Wil before he reported aboard
at Farpoint Station.
You chose your first officer
without ever meeting him?
I was looking through the records
of about fifty candidates... Wil's
was much like all the others...
filled with the usual dry
statistics and glowing letters of
recommendation that tell you
nothing. I was about to put it
aside and go on to the next file,
when something caught my eye.
There had been an incident on
Altair Three when Wil was First
Officer of the Hood. He refused
to let Captain DeSoto beam down
during a crisis. He disobeyed a
direct order and risked a general
court martial because he thought
he was right. When I read that...
I knew I'd found my Number One.
You wanted someone with a history
of disobedience?
I wanted someone who would stand
up to me... someone who was more
concerned with the safety of the
ship and accomplishing the mission
than with how something looked on
his record. To me, that's one of
the marks of a good officer.
Frankly, I've always felt it was
more important for an officer to
trust his captain's judgment. In
a crisis, there's no time for
explanations... orders have to be
obeyed without question or lives
may be lost.
I am aware of that, Admiral.
Of course you are.
I guess this mission has brought
up some... old ghosts for me. You
know what it's like to lose a
ship... you're always wondering
if there was something else you
should have done... something you
missed.
Admiral... the records regarding
the loss of the Pegasus are a
bit... vague about what happened
just before you abandoned ship.
Can you add anything to the...
official account?
I'm afraid not.
But I can tell you this: Twelve
years ago, I needed an officer I
could count on in a crisis...
someone who would support and obey
my decisions without question...
someone willing to trust my
judgment... that someone was Wil
Riker... and without his loyalty,
none of us would have survived.
What's wrong?
I think I busted a rib.
What were you doing?
I was practicing Bat'leth moves
with Worf. I jabbed when I
should've blocked. He caught me
right in the side. I'm glad we
were using sticks instead of real
blades.
It's broken all right.
Give him ten cc's of terakine for
the pain.
I can't believe how stupid I was.
You both got a little carried
away, that's all...
No. It was my fault. I lost
focus... I let myself get
distracted at a crucial moment.
It happens to everyone.
I knew what I was supposed to
do... but I didn't do it. If
we'd had real Bat'leths I might be
dead right now.
Wil... it's all right. You made
a mistake... no harm done. You'll
do better next time.
Yeah... maybe.
Scan of grid one five seven is
complete. Moving to grid one five
eight.
The Romulan ship is still
searching grid two seven zero.
They're sure taking their time
over there. I wonder if they--
Whoa... I think we might have just
struck paydirt.
There's a subspace resonance
signature coming from this
asteroid.
And from the frequency variances,
it looks like the pattern from a
Federation warp core.
Captain Picard to the Bridge,
please.
Bring us to within ten kilometers
of asteroid gamma six zero one.
Geordi's found something.
There's a subspace resonance
signature coming from that
asteroid, sir. It could be the
warp core of the Pegasus.
I think he's right... I recognize
some of the variance patterns.
Put the asteroid on the main
viewer.
I have confirmed Geordi's
readings, sir. The resonance
signature is originating from
somewhere beneath the asteroid's
surface.
Beneath the surface? How's that
possible?
This asteroid contains several
deep chasms large enough for a
starship to enter. It is possible
the Pegasus drifted into the
asteroid's gravitational field and
was pulled down into one of the
fissures.
Sir, the Romulan warbird has
altered course again... they are
heading toward our position.
They probably want to see what
we're so interested in over here.
Mister Data, how long will it take
to determine the exact location of
the Pegasus?
At least another six hours,
Captain.
That's too long. If the Romulans
start searching the asteroid, they
could find the ship before we do.
I recommend we destroy the
asteroid. It would take almost
all our photon torpedoes, but it
would preclude any possibility of
the Pegasus falling into Romulan
hands.
Our top priority is to salvage the
ship, Commander. I'll consider
destroying it only as a last
resort.
Yes, sir.
Can you give me a third
alternative?
Mister Data, is it possible to
saturate the asteroid with
verteron particles? That could
mask the resonance signature from
the Romulans... prevent them from
detecting it.
In order for the deception to
succeed, it would have to appear
to be a natural phenomenon.
Verteron particles are artificial
in nature.
Wait a minute... we could blanket
the asteroid with high levels of
ionizing radiation. There's so
much of it in this system already,
the Romulans won't know the
difference.
Data?
Theoretically, it should work..
If we're going to do it, we have
to do it fast... the Romulans will
be in sensor range in about a
minute.
Make it so, Mister Data.
Aye, sir. Initiating an
ionization field pulse.
After he's finished, we'll have to
move off... make it look like we
scanned the asteroid, but didn't
find anything.
Lay in a course to the next search
grid and stand-by to engage.
If this works, the Romulans won't
find anything and we can return
later. But if it doesn't...
If it doesn't... we'll have handed
them the Pegasus.
Ionization pulse complete.
Helm, one quarter impulse.
Engage.
The Romulans are initiating a
tachyon scan of the asteroid...
They have switched to their
lateral sensor array... beginning
another scan.
They're certainly being thorough.
The Warbird has completed its
sensor sweep.
If they found the resonance
signature, they should be sending
away teams any second now...
They are moving off.
Mister Data, we have to convince
the Romulans that we're still
looking for the Pegasus. I want
you to continue scanning this
system.
Yes, sir.
I want to be back at this asteroid
at zero eight hundred hours
tomorrow. Plot our search pattern
accordingly.
Aye, sir.
Admiral, if you'd care to join me
for a late dinner... ?
Thank you, no. I think I'm going
to turn in early.
Very well.
Number One, you have the Bridge.
Oh, and will you bring the scan
analysis to my quarters when you
go off watch?
Aye, sir.
Initiate search of grid one six
three.
Beginning sensor sweeps...
Commander, I want to see you in
the Captain's Ready Room.
Mister Data, you have the Bridge.
Aye, sir.
What the hell's the matter with
you? Destroy the Pegasus? Before
we've even taken a look at it?
I thought it was more important to
keep the Romulans from--
Well, you were wrong. We have a
chance here to change the balance
of power in this quadrant. But we
can't do that if we destroy the
Pegasus, now can we?
No, sir.
It hasn't been easy I'm sure...
keeping your Captain and friends
in the dark like this...
I haven't enjoyed it if that's
what you mean.
I hope you understand that it's
necessary.
I understand that you think it's
necessary.
You have changed.
Changed... ?
Just something the Captain and I
were talking about...
To be honest... I'm glad to see
this kind of change in you, Wil.
Strong... forceful... unafraid to
state your opinions and stand by
them... a far cry from the young
man who used to sit at my helm and
worry about pressing the wrong
button.
A lot of things can change in
twelve years, Admiral.
Yes, they can.
But it's important that a man
changes the right things in his
life... not his sense of duty...
his sense of loyalty...
I'd like to think that I...
haven't changed those things, sir.
I'd like to think so too. Because
those things say more about a man
than the rank on his collar or the
uniform he wears... they define
him.
Twelve years ago, a lot of older
and more seasoned officers turned
away from their duty, but you
stood up for what was right. I
know what kind of man you are,
Wil... and I know I can count on
you again.
Come.
The scan analysis you asked for.
Thank you. Can I interest you in
some sashimi?
No, thanks.
Is there anything else, sir?
Yes, there is.
"Judge Advocate General's Report.
Stardate xxxxx. Subject: Inquiry
into Mutiny Aboard USS Pegasus."
"Based on testimony from Captain
Pressman and other surviving
officers, the Judge Advocate
believes there is sufficient
evidence to conclude that certain
members of the crew did mutiny
against the captain just prior to
the destruction of the Pegasus."
Mutiny... on a Federation
starship. It's shocking -- no,
it's unthinkable. And yet you've
never mentioned it.
No, sir.
It wasn't easy getting this
record. I had to call in a few
favors at Starfleet just to get a
look at it. It seems the file was
sealed by Starfleet Intelligence.
So... not only was the Pegasus
carrying "sensitive" equipment
that can't be allowed to fall into
Romulan hands...
... not only was there a mysterious
explosion which appeared to
destroy the ship, but didn't...
but now it turns out there was a
mutiny on board.
I've read the official report of
the mutiny. But I'd like to hear
your version of what happened.
I was on the Bridge. The ship was
at yellow alert... we were running
some... tests on the engines.
Something went wrong... there was
an explosion in Engineering...
heavy casualties. In the middle
of the crisis, the First Officer,
the Chief Engineer, almost the
entire Bridge crew mutinied
against Captain Pressman.
Why?
They... felt the Captain was
jeopardizing the ship.
And you?
I was seven months out of the
Academy... my head was still
ringing with words like duty and
honor.
When they moved against him, I
thought they were a group of self-serving,
disloyal officers.
So I grabbed a phaser and defended
my captain. Two or three others
joined in on our side, but it was
clear the mutineers had most of
the crew behind them... we felt we
had to get off the ship. There
was a... running firefight all
the way to the escape pod.
About five minutes after we left
the ship... there was an
explosion...
"The Judge Advocate also believes
that the surviving officers are
deliberately withholding vital
information from this inquiry.
Further investigation is
recommended."
But there was no further
investigation... the file was
classified and quietly buried.
Why?
Sir... maybe you should take this
up with the Admiral.
I'm taking it up with you. The
Judge Advocate thought you were
participating in a conspiracy to
cover-up the truth. That you were
lying about what really happened
on the Pegasus. Now, I want you
to tell me that's not true.
Wil, what the hell's going on
here? Why did your crew mutiny?
And why is Pressman so determined
to find your ship twelve years
later?
I've told you all I can. I am
under the direct orders of Admiral
Pressman... not to discuss this.
Sir.
Very well. He's an admiral, I'm
a captain -- I can't force you to
disobey him.
I will tell you this... I need to
place a great deal of trust in the
person who serves as my first
officer. You've had that trust...
until now. But something is wrong
here... and you're part of it.
And when this mission is over...
I may have to re-evaluate the
command structure of this ship.
Dismissed.
Captain, Starfleet places the
highest priority on the success of
this mission. Your request for a
delay is denied.
Margaret... something's very wrong
here. Do you know what's going
on?
I know that the Chief of Starfleet
Intelligence herself is watching
this one, Jean-Luc. So you would
be well-advised to follow
Pressman's orders and leave it at
that. Starfleet out.
Worf to Captain Picard. We are
approaching asteroid gamma six
zero one, sir.
On my way.
Mister Worf, where are the
Romulans?
They are out of sensor range on
the far side of the system.
Bring us to within fifteen
kilometers and hold position.
For the past several hours, I have
been scanning the area where we
detected the resonance signature
of the Pegasus. From the strength
and polarity of the signature, it
would appear that most of the warp
core is still intact.
If we're lucky, the entire
engineering section could be down
there.
So how do we get to it? I
wouldn't want to try to transport
through that much solid rock.
Agreed. What about a shuttle? We
could send it down through one of
these fissures.
I would recommend against that,
sir. There may be gravimetric or
magnetic fluctuations inside the
asteroid which would overpower the
engines on a shuttlecraft.
Sounds like the best solution is
to take the Enterprise in.
You mean into the asteroid?
That's right.
Put this fissure on the main
viewer.
This chasm is large enough for us
to maneuver in. Besides, if
there's any hope of salvaging the
Pegasus, we'll need a starship to
do it.
Mister Data?
It is theoretically possible,
Captain. But I am unaware of any
prior situation where a starship
was taken so deeply inside a
planetary body. There may be
unforeseen difficulties.
Admiral... I don't think we can
risk--
I've made my decision. Prepare to
take the Enterprise in, Captain.
That's an order.
Mister Data, please note in the
ship's log that this action is
being taken over my explicit
objections.
It is so noted.
Yellow Alert.
Shields up, inertial dampers to
maximum.
Mister Data, plot a course into
the chasm... maneuvering thrusters
only.
Course plotted.
Take us in.
We are now two kilometers beneath
the surface.
We are encountering shifts in
magnetic field density.
Admiral, if the passage narrows to
less than five hundred meters, I'm
going to abort the mission.
You can charge me with
insubordination if you wish, but
I won't risk the Enterprise for a
salvage operation.
Sir... I am reading a large
resonance signature directly
ahead.
On screen.
Pegasus...
What the hell happened?
Sensors show that the ship is
still intact... but approximately
sixty-five percent of it is
contained within the asteroid.
As if half the ship had
materialized inside solid rock.
Yes, sir. I do not know how this
could have happened.
Let's keep the speculation to a
minimum. We have to begin the
salvage operation. The equipment
we need was in main engineering.
Can you scan that section of the
Pegasus?
The starboard bulkhead of Main
Engineering is contained within
the rock face... but most of the
compartment is still intact.
There is a hull breach in that
section.
If we begin a power transfer, can
you restore life support to that
compartment?
I believe so. The breach can be
temporarily sealed by extending
our shields.
See to it. Once you've restored
life support, Commander Riker and
I will beam directly into
Engineering.
Admiral, I'd like to send a
complete Away Team to --
There's some very sensitive
equipment over there. I don't
want anyone else near it.
Yes, sir.
This room was open to space for
twelve years...
The vacuum preserved everything...
I wonder how many of the crew are
back there...
We're not here for a memorial
service.
It should be in here.
It's still intact.
What's wrong? Don't you
understand? We found it.
I know. I just kept hoping it
wasn't going to be here... that it
would've been destroyed or buried
back there in the rock...
What the hell's that supposed to
mean?
It means I can't put this off any
longer. Right up until this
moment, I had the... luxury of
time. Now I have to make a
choice.
And Admiral... I'm afraid the only
choice I can make... is to put a
stop to this. I can't let you
start these experiments all over
again. It was wrong twelve years
ago, and it's still wrong today.
You'd better reconsider that
position, Commander. We have a
mission to accomplish and you're
going to carry it out.
That's all that matters to you,
isn't it -- starting your
experiment again. Look around...
we're standing in a room filled
with bodies... people who died
because of that thing.
Keep your self-righteous comments
to yourself. I knew most of these
people a lot longer than you
did... it was tragic. But it was
their own fault.
You don't know that. Neither of
us knows what happened after we
left.
It's not hard to guess. They
tried to shut down an experiment
they didn't understand. Something
went wrong. And it killed them.
No... we killed them.
That doesn't sound like the young
Conn Officer who grabbed a phaser
and defended his captain twelve
years ago.
Yeah, well I've had twelve years
to think about it. And if I had
to do it over again... I'd point
that phaser at you instead of
them.
So on reflection... you'd rather
be a traitor than a hero.
I wasn't a hero and neither were
you. What you were doing was
wrong and I was wrong to support
you... I was just too young and
stupid to realize it at the time.
You were the captain, I was the
ensign... and I followed orders.
And if you hadn't, you'd be dead
right now along with all the rest.
Dead because you listened to a
bunch of mutinous cowards who were
too blinded by fear to see what I
was trying to do.
They were brave enough to risk
their lives to stop you from
violating a treaty the Federation
signed in good faith.
That treaty has bound our hands
and given the Romulans a tactical
advantage for sixty years. I was
simply trying to level the playing
field.
And now you're going to try again.
How many people will die this
time? Fifty? A hundred? A
thousand?
You don't want to help me... fine.
But you're still under my direct
orders not to talk about what you
know... and I expect you to follow
those orders to the letter.
I made you... and I can break you
just as easily.
Picard to Away Team. Prepare to
return to the ship immediately.
Stand-by, Enterprise.
Pressman to Enterprise. Two
people, one piece of equipment to
beam up.
Report.
The Romulans fired on the entrance
to the chasm with their
disruptors... they've sealed us
in.
Sir... there is an incoming
message... it is from the
Warbird.
On screen.
Captain... you seem to be in a
very... unfortunate circumstance.
How can we help?
Are you responsible for this?
I'm not sure. We were conducting
some... geological experiments on
the surface of the asteroid. It's
possible that we... accidently
sealed you in.
If only we had known you were
beneath the surface... if you had
shared your plans with us, this
might have been avoided.
What is it you want, Sirol?
I don't want anything, Captain.
But I will offer to help you.
How?
By transporting your crew aboard
my ship. We'll take you back to
Romulus... where after a short
stay as our guests, you will be
returned to the Federation.
Thank you for your... generous
offer. I will... take it under
advisement.
As you wish. We'll be continuing
our... research in this system for
a while longer. I await your
decision.
We can't do it. If we abandon the
Enterprise they'll come back here
and get their hands on both ships.
Agreed. Options?
We could use the phasers to cut
our way out.
The asteroid's internal structure
is highly unstable. Any attempt
to cut through the rock could
cause the entire chasm to
collapse.
Captain... I have a suggestion.
There's a piece of equipment under
guard in Admiral Pressman's
quarters which could get us out of
here.
It's a prototype for a Federation
cloaking device.
You just ended your career, Wil.
That's what this is all about? A
cloaking device? In the Treaty of
Algeron the Federation
specifically agreed not to develop
cloaking technology.
And that treaty is the biggest
mistake we ever made. It's kept
us from exploiting a vital area of
defense that--
That treaty has kept the peace for
sixty years. And as a Starfleet
officer, you are sworn to uphold
it.
That's enough. I'm taking command
of this vessel. Mister Worf,
escort the Captain to his
quarters.
I don't think anyone's going to
come to your defense this time.
How can we use the cloak to escape
the asteroid?
It's more than just a cloak. It
changes the structure of matter...
in theory, a ship using this
device would be able to pass
through normal matter.
That's why you were so eager to
find it...
Can't you see the potential here?
The phasing cloak could be the
greatest breakthrough in weapons
research in the last fifty years.
Except it's illegal... it's a
violation of an agreement the
Federation signed in good faith.
Captain... we might be able to
adapt the cloak for the Enterprise
engines and use it to escape the
asteroid.
Mister Data?
It is theoretically possible, sir.
But it will take several hours to
study the device and determine how
to link it to our systems.
Make it so.
Captain's Log: Stardate 47457.1.
We have been trapped inside the
asteroid for over eight hours.
Mister Data and Commander La Forge
inform me that they are nearly
ready to engage the cloak.
Commander, I've routed the impulse
engines through the warp plasma
conduits... but you'll have to
watch the intercooler levels... if
they go too high, we'll blow out
the entire relay system.
Understood.
I think that's what happened
twelve years ago. The cloak blew
out the plasma relays on the
Pegasus after we left the ship...
the plasma ignited in space, and
it looked like the ship had been
destroyed.
So the ship drifted into this
system... still in a phased
state... and when it passed
through this asteroid...
The cloak failed. And half the
ship materialized in solid rock.
La Forge to Bridge. The cloak is
on-line and ready to begin phase
sequencing.
Proceed, Number One.
Aye, sir.
Activating power systems...
Report.
The cloak appears to be
functioning normally. The ship's
matter/energy phasing rate should
be sufficient to pass through the
asteroid.
Take us out. Maneuvering
thrusters only.
We will reach the rock face in...
five seconds.
We have passed through two
kilometers of the asteroid... now
within one kilometer of the
surface.
We're approaching the surface...
We have cleared the asteroid,
Captain.
The Warbird is off the port bow.
They're still waiting for us to
make up our minds.
Disengage the cloaking device,
Commander.
What? You can't do that. If the
Romulans see us decloak, they'll
know that we have --
They'll know the truth, Admiral.
Which is what everyone is going to
know very shortly.
Carry out my orders.
Mister Worf, send a message to the
Warbird... inform them that their
government will be contacted
shortly regarding this incident.
Aye, sir.
Admiral, I hereby charge you with
violation of the Treaty of
Algeron. As Captain of the
Enterprise, I'm placing you under
arrest. Mister Worf?
Admiral, if you will come with
me...
I have a lot of friends at
Starfleet Command, Captain.
You're going to need them.
Lieutenant. I'll have to be
placed under arrest as well.
I've spoken to Fleet Admiral
Shanthi. There will be a full
inquiry once we reach Starbase two-four-seven...
and it will probably
lead to a general court martial of
Admiral Pressman and several
others at Starfleet Intelligence.
Your... involvement in this affair
will be thoroughly investigated,
Wil... there will be some hard
questions for you to answer...
I understand.
You made a mistake twelve years
ago... but your service since that
time has earned you a great deal
of respect... from me and from a
great many others. This incident
may cost you some of that
respect...
I can't help feeling that I should
have come forward a long time
ago...
When the moment came to make the
decision... you made the right
one...
No matter what that choice may
have cost you... and no matter how
much Pressman may have meant to
you... you chose to tell the
truth and face the consequences.
As long as you can do that...
you'll still deserve to wear that
uniform... and I'll still be
proud to have you as my first
officer.
