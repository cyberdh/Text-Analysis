Captain's log, stardate 44995.3.
We are en route to the Klingon
Home World, where I will
participate in the installation
ceremony of Gowron, the next
designated Leader of the High
Council.
This visit should also provide
an opportunity for one of my
officers to correct... a grave
injustice..
Enter.
Am I intruding?
No, sir. My apologies, Captain...
I can be back in uniform---
That won't be necessary.
I'm not here as your captain.
I'm here as the person that stood
with you before the High
Council... your cha'DIch.
We'll arrive at your Home World
in less than a day.
It is not yet time.
That doesn't sound like the man
who came to me a year ago...
fiercely determined to return home
and clear his father's name...
or die trying.
You accepted this... dishonor from
the Council in order to hold the
Empire together.
The Empire survives. Isn't it
time to confront the Council...
to regain your family name and
let the truth be known?
I have been told... that patience
is sometimes a more effective
weapon than a sword.
Patience is a... human virtue,
one which I am proud to see you've
taken to heart. But this
situation may require a more...
Klingon response.
Your discommendation is a facade
intended to protect men less
honorable than you. It is a
lie... and lies must be
challenged.
I have grown... weary of bearing
this dishonor...
We will be in orbit around your
planet for at least two days...
it may be some time before we
return again. I would be
favorably disposed to grant a
leave should you request one.
Bridge to Captain Picard.
Thank you, sir.
Go ahead, Number One.
We've been intercepted by the
Klingon vessel Bortas. They claim
to be our escort.
No escort was scheduled.
The Bortas is standing by,
Captain.
On screen.
Gowron... this is an unexpected
pleasure.
I must speak with you, Picard.
We have to move quickly if we are
to be successful.
Successful?
Yes.
In preventing a Klingon civil war.
The family of Duras is massing
support... they have many allies
on the Council...
But Duras died in disgrace. By
Klingon tradition, his family
should share in that disgrace.
Their corruption has poisoned the
Empire. Honor will soon have
no meaning.
Who speaks for his family now?
Lursa and B'Etor... the sisters
of Duras.
And they would claim leadership
of the Council?
Women may not serve on the
Council...
Then how... ?
I don't know. But they are
plotting something. They have
secured the loyalty of at least
three fleet commanders.
Their followers do not care about
Duras' crimes. Lursa and B'etor
are feared... and fear is power.
I fail to see what I can do to
assist...
You were first chosen as arbiter
of succession because no Klingon
could be trusted. You accepted
this duty... and you must see it
through to the end. You must
ensure my installation.
I am prepared to report to the
Council that only you have
completed the rite of
succession...
Not enough. Duras was a Romulan
collaborator. You must declare
his family ineligible to ever
again sit on the ruling Council.
That... is beyond my purview.
You will not support me?
I will not step outside the
traditional role of the arbiter.
And if they attempt to block my
installation?
I can only assure you that I will
deal with any challenge according
to Klingon law.
I fear that will not be enough.
Mister Worf, please escort our
guest to the transporter room.
Mister Data, begin monitoring
Romulan activity along the Neutral
Zone. Have the outpost stations
there start sending us their
tactical reports.
Yes, sir.
The Duras family is preparing to
move against Gowron.
Backed by Romulans?
I don't know. But there's too
much history between the Duras
(note: plural) and the Romulans
to discount the possibility.
Dismissed.
I would speak with you.
I do not hear the words of a
traitor.
I am not a traitor.
You admitted your guilt before
the Council.
I accepted discommendation to
protect the Empire.
Protect it? How?
It was Duras' father who betrayed
our people to the Romulans at
Khitomer. Not mine.
Duras. There is proof of this?
There is.
Why would you accept dishonor
to protect Duras?
His family was too powerful. To
expose him would have split the
Empire. Instead, the Council
chose to blame my father.
The Council knew?
I believe you are a man of honor,
Gowron.
I ask you to restore my family
name.
Worf, you killed Duras. I
consider that no small favor.
But what you ask is impossible.
But after your Installation...
The grasp of Duras reaches out
from the grave. Much of the
Council is still loyal to his
family. I must have the
Council's support to survive.
I cannot expose their treachery.
You chose to accept this disgrace
for the good of the Empire. Now,
you must live with your decision
like a Klingon.
Guinan?
Hi. Ten Forward's been pretty
quiet today... I thought I'd get
in a little target practice. Mind
if I join you?
You... practice?
Sure. I like to keep my eye
sharp.
I... practice at... level
fourteen.
That's okay. I can go back to
that level for a while.
You know, I have a bet with the
captain that I can make you smile
before you make lieutenant
commander.
Not a good bet today.
Ready?
Computer, level fourteen... begin
program.
Program initiated.
I'm sure I heard you laugh
once... I liked it...
Klingons don't laugh.
Not true. Not true at all. You
may not laugh. But believe me,
I've heard some Klingon belly
laughs that could shake a room.
Your son laughs and he's Klingon.
He's a child. And part human.
Oh, that's right and you're not.
You're all Klingon. Except you
don't laugh.
I don't laugh because I don't feel
like laughing.
But other Klingons feel like
laughing. What does that say
about you... ?
Perhaps it says... I do not feel
like other Klingons.
Program complete.
Good game.
Hey, don't feel bad... I was
doing this years before you were
born.
How is he, by the way? Your son.
He is having some... difficulties
adjusting to life on Earth.
Must be tough for a little guy
like that... living with humans,
being Klingon... it has to get
confusing sometimes...
It will not be easy for him...
No, it won't. But the time will
come when he'll have to find out
what it really means to be
Klingon...
Just as the time has come now for
you, Worf.
Come.
Captain, I request a leave of
absence.
Mister Worf... request granted.
Thank you, sir.
Mister Worf...
Qapla!
And good luck.
Lieutenant Worf, personal log,
stardate 44996.1. I have located
the Klingon ship on which my
brother Kurn serves as captain
and have arranged to join him.
It has been too long, my brother.
Too long.
There is much to discuss. I have
asked Gowron to restore our family
honor. He has refused.
No matter. Gowron will not live
to see the day he leads the
Council...
What do you mean?
He stands alone, surrounded by
his enemies. Lursa and B-Etor
will have him killed... and if
they don't, I will.
You will... ?
Gowron is weak... and the family
of Duras must never be allowed
to lead the Council. All of our
leaders... have failed us. They
no longer deserve our loyalty.
It is time to sweep away the old
Council... and put a new one in
its place.
How could this be done?
I already have the support of four
squadron commanders in strategic
sectors. When the time comes,
they will follow me.
Join us, Worf... we will usher
in a new era, and regain our
family name.
No.
What?
Gowron has completed the rite of
succession... it is our duty to
support him.
Gowron spits in your face when
you ask him to give back what is
rightfully ours... and you would
support him?
We cannot regain honor by acting
dishonorably.
I will not support Gowron.
I am the elder brother, Kurn...
I speak for our family.
We will back Gowron.
But not now. Not yet. We will
wait. Until Gowron feels the
grasp of his enemies around his
throat. Then we will offer him
our support. And the price will
be the restoration of our family
name.
It will be difficult to convince
my allies to back Gowron.
But I will try. I must go to the
Mempa sector and meet with the
other squadron commanders.
Contact me when you have gained
their support.
Then I will be ready for Gowron.
naDev ghoS! (Come here!)
Have you reached a decision
regarding the succession of
power?
Qaja plu d'itch jung. La woq you
ghir klas qimha. Gowron. Doj
hon. Doj hon.
Your Klingon is flawless, Picard.
Not even a trace of a human
accent. The Council thanks you
for your service to the Empire.
Gowron, son of M'Rel, hakt'em.
The arbiter confirms that you
have completed the rite of
succession. Your enemies have
been destroyed. You stand alone.
Do you wish to claim leadership
of the Council?
I wish it.
Are there no other challengers?
There is one.
I will challenge him.
An arrogant child!
Who are you?
I am Toral... son of Duras.
Duras had no son!
But he did...
So, this is your doing...
We wish to address the Council.
Lursa, B'Etor, come forward.
Members of the High Council, it
is a day of great rejoicing for
the family of Duras and the
Klingon Empire. We have
discovered that our brother did
indeed have a son and heir.
This is an outrage! Duras had
no mate. Where did you find him,
Lursa? In a harlot's bed
chamber?
I will personally cut your tongue
out, Yintagh!
Impudent wretch.
A simple genetic scan will prove
his bloodline is valid.
The illegitimate son of Duras
cannot rule the High Council.
The Council will decide whether
to accept the challenge of Toral,
alleged son of Duras. In favor?
Opposed.
The challenge is accepted.
The arbiter will consider its
validity.
Len'mat. (Adjourned)
Our allies on the Council backed
Toral's claim. It's in Picard's
hands, now.
Excellent. Everything is
proceeding as scheduled.
It will make matters simpler if
the captain is cooperative... but
we are prepared to move in any
case.
Why not just kill Picard?
Fool! Do we want the Federation
as our enemy?
No.
At least, not yet. But when the
time is right... we will deal with
the Federation... and Captain
Picard.
I have met with the other squadron
commanders here... three will join
us, one will not.
That gives us enough strength to
control seven key sectors.
Do you know the strength of our
enemies?
They have at least seven
squadrons... but most of the fleet
has not decided which banner to
follow.
Gowron is nearly out of options.
Soon he will have no choice...
I will soon return to the Home
World. We shall meet then.
Do you also require the original
logs recorded during the attack,
Lieutenant?
Everything we have on the
Khitomer massacre.
I can provide you with our
analysis of communications between
the Khitomer outpost and the
Romulan ships; however, for a
complete record you will have to
contact Starbase Twenty-Four and
request---
Mister Worf... have you cancelled
your leave?
No, sir.
Lieutenant... join me in my ready
room.
You are planning to use our files
on the Khitomer massacre as
evidence against Duras' father?
Yes, sir.
Mister Worf... do you not see an
inherent conflict of interest...
Sir, these records can help me
prove that my father was falsely
accused of treason.
You are using your position as
a Starfleet officer to affect
political change on your
planet... there could not be a
worse compromise of our
fundamental principles...
Captain... you urged me to fight
this battle...
Yes, I know. I understand your
motives, and you know I support
your goals, but...
Do not tie my hands now... I
must be able to prove my father's
innocence. The Federation records
will do that.
Mister Worf... Mister Worf...
Mister Worf...
Here I am lecturing you on a
conflict of interest while I'm
desperately trying to avoid one
of my own. Do you think I wish
to allow the Duras family to
solidify their hold on the
Council? Do you think I cannot
see the implications for the
Federation? And good Lord, Duras
tried to have me killed!
All of my instincts... my
training... my very being as a
Starfleet officer are at odds with
my responsibilities as arbiter
for the Klingon High Council.
We walk the same tightrope between
two worlds... you and I. We must
try our very best to keep those
worlds clearly separate... or we
shall certainly fall.
Yes, sir.
As far as these records from
Khitomer are concerned...
I will make the Federation
records on the Khitomer massacre
available... to anyone who wants
them... the High Council, the
Duras family... anyone.
Thank you, sir.
Mister Worf, this is as far as
I can go.
Riker to Captain Picard.
Yes, Number One.
There's a message coming in for
you from the surface. It's coded
personal.
Send it through.
Welcome, Captain.
Something to drink? Tea... Earl
Grey, perhaps?
Yes... thank you.
You come... alone and unarmed...
Nothing would be served by killing
the arbiter before his decision.
Nevertheless, a brave act,
Captain.
B'Etor...
Your invitation was... unexpected.
We should have extended it much
sooner.
We don't want you to judge us by
your experience with our brother.
Duras was a fool.
He deserved to die.
Forget him. We have.
We do not wish to be your enemy.
Quite the opposite.
That... pleases me.
Have you made a decision regarding
Toral's challenge?
I am pursuing it with all due
vigilance.
Let me heat your tea.
Toral has the bloodline to lead
the Empire into the next century.
He has the support of the people.
The remaining issue then is to
see if he has the support of the
law.
But he must. Surely, you can see
that.
I'll tell you what I see. If I
find Toral's challenge valid, the
two of you will very quickly gain
control of the Council... and
Gowron will be found dead shortly
thereafter. If I reject Toral's
challenge, you will accuse me of
doing it only to serve Federation
interests. It will give you a
rallying cry to declare war and
overthrow Gowron.
You see very clearly, Captain.
But one thing is missing.
If you rule against us and we are
victorious in a war against
Gowron...
... which we would be...
... it would mean the end of the
alliance with the Federation.
And we'd hate to see that happen
as much as you would.
This is not a threat, Captain.
Just an unfortunate truth.
So why be our enemy, when you can
be our friend?
You have manipulated the
circumstances, ladies, with the
skill of a Romulan.
My decision will be announced at
high sun tomorrow. Excellent tea.
Good day.
What is your decision?
K'tal, this Council knows the law
of heredity well. G'now juk Hol
pajhard. A son will share in
the honors or crimes of his
father. Toral is Duras' son...
that has been established by the
genetic scan. And it is
heartwarming to see him embraced
by the family of Duras... for they
are an old and noble family.
But with due respect to the
traditions and laws of this High
Council, there is no basis for
accepting a petition for
leadership from a boy who has
fought no battles, shed no blood
for his people, earned no honor
for himself. Perhaps some day
he shall. But not now.
Duras... is dead. His claim to
the leadership died with him.
Gowron will lead the Council.
The arbiter has ruled. There
are no more challengers.
Does the Federation dictate
Klingon destiny or do we? Follow
me. And I will show you honor.
Follow him and you reject all
Klingon law...
Can you not see what you are
doing... are you blind to what
they represent... are there so
few noble Klingons left?
Then go... your blood will paint
the way to the future.
Remember this day.
Your message said it was urgent.
What do you want?
Your forces are weak, Gowron...
you will need help to fight the
family of Duras.
From one dishonored Klingon...
I offer you four Klingon
squadrons.
Why would they follow you... a
Starfleet officer?
They are pledged to support...
my brother, Kurn.
Kurn is your brother?
His true bloodline was kept
hidden to protect him.
Kurn will follow me? He has
opposed me in the past.
I am the elder brother... he will
do as I say.
What is it you want in return?
You know my price.
The return of your honor. For
the support of four squadrons... ?
No, that will not be enough.
The Duras family controls most
of the fleet.
We must have Federation help.
They will not intervene.
Perhaps not yet... but Starfleet
Command will listen to Picard...
and Picard listens to you.
I can ask nothing more of him in
this matter.
What?
My duty as a Starfleet officer---
You come to me and demand the
restoration of your family
honor... and now you hide behind
Human excuses!
What are you, Worf? Do you
tremble and quake with fear at
the approach of combat... hoping
to talk your way out of a fight...
like a Human... or do you hear
the cry of the warrior... calling
you to battle... calling you to
glory... like a Klingon?
Are you one of us?
Status!
Aft shields down...
Warp coils damaged...
Report.
We're still trying to sort it out.
A Klingon Bird of Prey just
decloaked and fired on the
Bortas. Neither ship is answering
our hail.
Worf is still aboard the Bortas.
A second Bird of Prey is
decloaking bearing two-four-seven
mark three-one-nine.
Go to Red Alert.
The second ship is joining the
attack on the Bortas.
It's begun.
Send an emergency signal to any
loyal ships!
Impulse engines not responding!
Engage emergency override!
Override engaged! Disruptors
still not responding!
The Bortas is sustaining heavy
damage, Captain. Her aft shields
have collapsed... life support
fluctuating...
The Bortas should have twice the
firepower of a Bird of Prey.
Her weapons systems were hit
pretty hard... they haven't
brought them back on-line yet.
The Bortas has lost its port
shields... it is unlikely they
will withstand another hit on that
quarter.
The Bortas has sent out a general
distress signal.
Ensign Reel... plot a course
safely away from the combat area.
Half impulse.
Captain... the Bortas is Gowron's
ship. If he's the legitimate
leader of the Empire, shouldn't
we help him?
If we come to his aid... we'll
be dragging the Federation into
a Klingon civil war.
What about Worf?
Ensign... engage.
The port shields are still down.
Disruptors on-line!
Lock on target.
No!
Their sensors will detect the
weapons lock. If they think
we're helpless, they'll try to
board the ship.
I can aim and fire disruptors
manually when they drop their
shields.
GhoS! (Make it so!)
Thirty-five thousand kellicams.
Twenty thousand kellicams... now
within transporter range.
SuH... (Ready.. )
They're dropping shields!
BaH! (Fire!)
Engaging computer control...
firing on second target!
They were able to raise shields
in time... minor damage only.
Disruptors off-line!
All power to shields.
Shields failing!
Incoming message.
On viewer.
This is Captain Kurn of the
Hegh'ta. We come to defend the
Empire... and to follow the banner
of Gowron.
The enemy has sustained major
damage to its life support
systems... They have disengaged.
You have done well, Commander
Kurn. Lursa and B'Etor have
moved more quickly than I
anticipated. We shall not
underestimate them again.
Meet us at the Great Hall.
Advise the Enterprise that their
delegation is welcome to attend...
my installation as leader.
Gowron, son of M'Rel, hakt'em.
The arbiter confirms that you
have completed the rite of
succession. Your enemies have
been destroyed. You stand alone.
Do you wish to claim leadership
of the Council?
I wish it.
Are there no other challengers?
Receive now the loyalty of the
Council and of the Empire.
Let all who have opposed me now
swear loyalty or die with shame!
Qapla!
naDev ghoS! (Come here!)
You both fought as warriors...
you have proved your hearts are
Klingon.
I return your family honor... I
give you back what was wrongfully
taken from you. Let your name
be spoken once again. You are
Worf... son of Mogh.
The Duras family is gathering a
large force near Beta Thoridar.
As per the terms of the Treaty
of Alliance, I now formally
request your assistance in
fighting these enemies of the
Empire.
These... enemies are Klingons.
By right and tradition, I am now
the sole leader... all who oppose
me... are traitors.
I understand your position.
However, you must be aware that
the Federation will not become
involved in what is, by
definition, an internal Klingon
matter.
You arbitrated the rite of
succession, you are already
involved!
And my duties in that regard are
finished.
Captain... we must intervene.
The Duras family is corrupt and
hungry for power... with no sense
of honor or loyalty. They
represent a grave threat to the
security of the Federation.
Captain, you and I know that they
have conspired with Romulans in
the past. If they should be the
victors in this war, they will
surely form a new Klingon/Romulan
alliance. That would represent
a fundamental shift of power in
this quadrant.
Starfleet must support Gowron...
it is in the interests of both
the Federation and the Empire.
I beg you to support us in our
cause.
Mister Worf... non-interference
in the internal affairs of other
cultures is one of the guiding
principles of the Federation...
and as Starfleet officers, we have
all sworn an oath to uphold that
principle regardless of personal
feeling.
I am sorry... but I must refuse
your request.
Lieutenant...
I'm afraid that I must now recall
you to duty. The Enterprise will
be leaving this sector
immediately.
Captain... I respectfully request
that I be allowed to take an
extended leave of absence.
Lieutenant, your responsibilities
as a Starfleet officer are
incompatible with remaining aboard
a Klingon ship during a time of
war.
Captain...
You are ordered to return to duty
immediately.
Then... I must resign my
commission as a Starfleet officer.
I will await you aboard the
Bortas.
Enter.
Am I intruding?
No, sir.
I understand... that you'll be
serving aboard the Bortas.
As weapons officer.
Your tactical knowledge and
experience should serve them well.
Thank you, sir.
Are you certain you've made the
right decision, Worf?
Yes.
I was rescued from Khitomer by
humans... raised and... loved by
human parents. I have lived among
humans for most of my life...
fought at their sides.
But I was born Klingon. My heart
is of that world. I do hear the
cry of the warrior...
I belong with my people.
Being the only Klingon ever to
serve in Starfleet... gave you
a singular distinction.
But I always felt that the most
unique thing about you was
your... humanity.
Compassion... generosity...
fairness... You took some of the
best qualities of humanity and
made them part of you. The
result... was a man I was proud
to call one of my officers.
I'll have your belongings
transported to the Bortas.
Thank you...
Attention on deck!
Permission to leave the ship, sir?
Permission granted.
Qapla'
Good-bye.
Dismissed.
Picard has rejected Gowron's plea
for help.
The Enterprise has left orbit.
Coward! He didn't have the
courage to face us. The
Federation is---
Celebrate later, Toral.
We should not discount Jean-Luc
Picard yet. He is human...
... and humans have a way of
showing up when you least expect
them.
