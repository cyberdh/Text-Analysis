Captain's log, Stardate 42923.7.
We are en route to the Braslota
System, site of the first
Starfleet battle simulation.
Joining the Enterprise as observer
and mediator is the Zakdorn Master
Strategist, Sirna Kolrami.
Despite misgivings, I have agreed
to Starfleet's request that we
take part in these wargame
exercises.
Mister Kolrami -- Captain Jean-Luc
Picard. Welcome aboard.
Captain. I bring greetings from
those at Starfleet Command.
Would you care to be shown to your
quarters?
I require little rest, Captain.
I would prefer to commence our
mission.
Despite their reputations, this
Zakdorn does not appear to be a
very formidable warrior.
In the game of military
brinksmanship, individual
physical prowess is less
important than the perception of
a species as a whole. For over
nine millennia potential foes have
regarded the Zakdorns as having
the greatest innately strategic
minds in the galaxy.
And no one is willing to test that
perception in combat.
Exactly.
Then the reputation means nothing.
The Braslota System. In orbit
around the second planet is the
eighty-year old Starcruiser,
Hathaway.
He is still your choice?
Commander Riker will captain the
Hathaway.
You will have forty-eight hours
to ready the vessel before the
Enterprise attacks.
And we'll be experiencing actual
battle conditions?
Correct. Engineering will
disconnect the Enterprise's
weapons and link the system with
the modified laser-pulse beam.
All "hits" will be recorded
electronically. If the computer
registers "damage," it will react
accordingly -- shutting down the
affected areas for the appropriate
"repair" time. Additional
questions?
Captain Picard, I understand that
you initially resisted Starfleet's
request for this simulation.
Yes.
May I know why?
Starfleet is not a military
organization. Our purpose is
exploration.
Then why am I here?
Because with the Borg threat,
I have decided that my officers
and I need to hone our tactical
skills.
In a crisis situation, it is
prudent to have several options.
I still prefer brains over brawn.
I think it's a waste of
effort to test our combat skills
-- it's a minor province in the
make-up of a starship captain.
Your objection is noted. Let us
hope your distaste for the
exercise will not affect your
strategic abilities.
Mister Kolrami, when I agree to
do a thing. I do it.
Care to surrender now, Captain?
Well, Number One, you are allowed
a complement of forty. Select
whom you will. Save Data, who
will serve as my first officer
in your absence.
I had envisioned you defining the
crew.
On my ship, the leader of an away
team has total control of the
mission. If you want to judge
"leadership" -- why not start at
the beginning?
Very well, Captain.
My, what a charmer.
Now, Doctor...
Captain, he needs an attitude
adjustment.
The Zakdornian culture is replete
with self-assuredness and
confidence. It is seldom
undeserved. For example, Kolrami
is a third level grand master at
the game of Strategema.
Another millimeter... little
more... there! Excellent.
Lieutenant.
Commander.
You've heard of the simulation
aboard the Hathaway?
Yes, sir, and the best of luck
to you. I've researched the old
Avidyne engines -- archaic by our
standards, very touchy.
Anticipating the worst, do you
think it can be whipped into shape
in forty-eight hours?
I've taken the liberty of packing
a few necessities.
Enter!
Am I disturbing you?
Just finishing, Commander.
"Interesting" quarters.
Thank you.
You know of the simulation. What
do you think?
Waste of time.
It's just designed to be an
exercise.
Useless. If there is nothing to
lose -- no sacrifice -- then there
is nothing to gain.
You mean -- besides "pride."
Well, it's a good thing in this
case, because I probably don't
have a chance.
There is always a chance.
Slim. The Hathaway's most
sophisticated weapon-systems --
even in a computer mock-up --
can't hope to defeat the
Enterprise.
Still...
Worf... when you're out-gunned,
out-manned, and out-equipped --
what else do you have left?
Guile.
Join me.
The honor is to serve.
Begin long-range scanning of all
sectors within three light years
of Braslota.
How is your crew shaping up?
It's complete, but I would like
to request an addition.
Anyone in mind?
With your permission, I would like
Acting Ensign Crusher aboard for
educational observation.
Oh... since we have some time
before reaching Braslota --
I was hoping that you would agree
to play me in a game of Strategema.
Although I am intrigued by the
audacity of your request, I can't
fathom why you wish the encounter.
I enjoy a challenge.
Very well, an opponent of "limited
dimensions" can often be quite
diverting.
Thank you.
So you're going to beat him?
Nope.
Oh, then it's going to be a close
one.
No.
But you have got a chance?
Nah.
Are you planning to show up?
Sure, Kolrami is the best at
Strategema. To even get to play
him is a privilege.
Other than you being privileged,
is there anything else I can
look forward to?
Nope.
This is going to be exciting.
Against an opponent of approximate
skill -- Strategema can last well
over one thousand moves.
I wouldn't bet on us being here
that long.
I have wagered heavily in the
ship's pool that you will take
him past the sixth plateau.
What if I don't?
I will be... irritated.
Forever curious, this urge to
"compete."
It's a human response, that inborn
craving to gauge your capabilities
through conflict.
Doctor, there are other ways to
challenge oneself.
Perhaps... but they all lack a
certain -- thrill!
Data, sometimes humans find it
helpful to have an outsider set
the standard by which they're
judged.
To avoid deceiving oneself.
Maybe you should challenge
Kolrami to Strategema.
Why?
Because when someone is that smug,
you occasionally have to deflate
them just a little.
Yeah, Data, I'd like to see your
neural-flecks tear him down a peg.
To what end?
Computer -- actuation positions
for Strategema.
Ready?
Begin!
That's it?
I'm afraid so.
But... but you only made
twenty-three moves.
Yes.
Congratulations.
Commander Riker --
There is your next challenge.
Away team assembled and ready to
transport, Commander.
Until we test our mettle on the
field of honor.
I may get over there and want to
come right home.
Good luck, Number One... Captain.
The simulation will commence in
forty-eight hours.
Not good.
Oh, Mister Worf, you're wrong.
It's fantastic... and it's ours
--
Mister Worf.
Sir, Lieutenant LaForge is a
superior officer. The honor
should be his.
Worf, this is a battle simulation,
and you're our tactical officer.
Mister LaForge and I agreed, you
need to be at my side.
And if the engine room is anything
like the bridge, I'm going to have
my hands full.
Attention crew of the USS
Hathaway -- this is your captain.
I can promise you that two days
from now we will have missed a
lot of sleep. But with your skill
and your stamina, we'll have this
old lady ready to fly.
I want hourly progress reports
from every station. Riker out.
It's a real mess down here, but
we'll get to work on it.
I'm sure you'll perform your
usual miracle.
Nice work, Geordi, now what's
the possibility for warp drive?
There are only minute dilithium
fragments left in the holding
clamps. And even if we had intact
crystals, there's no anti-matter
to fuel the drive.
Any recommendations?
No, sir.
We don't have a prayer.
Would you care to transfer back to
the Enterprise, Mister Crusher?
No, Sir!
Remember Wes, the purpose here
is to improvise. It's the effort
that counts.
Open.
I believe the rules are understood
by all.
The weapons conversion, Lieutenant
Burke?
Complete, Captain.
Signal received... locked on.
She's really been stripped down,
Captain.
The only offensive systems you
need will be simulated by
computer.
What's the Zakdornian word for
"mismatch?"
Challenge! We do not whine about
the inequities of life.
And how you perform in a
"mismatch" is precisely what
interests Starfleet. After all
--
-- when one is in the superior
position, one is expected to win.
Screen off. Data, you have the
bridge.
Lieutenant Commander Data -- I
am intrigued by your challenge.
Doctor Pulaski informed me of your
desire to play a game of
Strategema.
But I have expressed no such
interest.
What Commander Data means is that
he would never have had the nerve
to ask you himself, but I know
he is very interested in pitting
his skill against yours.
Play a machine? Why should I wish
to?
I don't blame you. It's no fun
going into a game when you know
you're going to lose.
But I wouldn't lose, and now
you're no doubt going to make
me prove it to you.
Come on, Data, you can't let that
pass.
Indeed I...
...Cannot.
Then you will play for the honor
of your ship.
Honor of the ship. It's your
reputation that's on the line.
With my knowledge of the
Enterprise's security override,
we may be able to convince the
sensors that an enemy ship is
approaching. Their instruments
would "lie" to them.
If you can pull that off, Mister
Worf, it might just give us the
edge we're looking for.
But what about the viewscreen?
If I am successful, the computer
will project a false image of the
enemy ship on the main viewscreen.
And unless they run to a window
and look out....
... They're going to fall for it!
The lining is still smooth, and
we ought to be able to do
something with the dilithium chips
we scavenged.
Sure the system is functional,
but without antimatter what
difference does it make?
Geordi, I have to return to the
Enterprise.
Wes, we've only got thirty-two
hours.
This is important.
This isn't?
Attempt the routing bypass here!
If it works, they will be
surprised.
Where'm I gonna get the
opti-cable?
Anywhere.
Sir, I left an experiment running
on the Enterprise. May I go back
and shut it down?
It's that important?
It has to be monitored. And it
is my final grade in plasma
physics.
In the present context, what did
she mean by, "Bust him up?"
Doctor Pulaski, in her own way, is
instructing you to take the
shortest route to victory.
As opposed to what?
Begin!
I can't believe it. The
"computer" was beaten by flesh
and blood.
You advanced quite far against
such a worthy opponent.
Thoroughly enjoyable, Mister Data.
I am at your disposal for a
rematch.
Thank you, but there would be no
point.
How can you lose? You're supposed
to be infallible!
Obviously I am not.
Message from the Hathaway, sir.
On screen.
I'd like to request permission
for Ensign Crusher to reboard the
Enterprise, Captain.
Why?
Apparently he was in such a hurry
to be part of the away team, he
left several critical experiments
unattended.
Have you any objection?
He should be escorted, and have
no contact with anything save his
research.
Permission granted.
Mister Burke, handle that.
I saw no sense in Riker choosing
him anyway -- he is just a
non-commissioned child.
I can't believe I forgot about
this. Good lesson not to let
excitement cloud your thinking.
Yeah.
This is really delicate ... I
spent six weeks setting it up.
Lot of work.
Oh, no. It's ruined.
That's too bad. Look, is this
going to take much longer?
I have to dispose of it safely...
This is really volatile... I
better beam it off the Enterprise
and leave it particalized.
Fine, let's just do it.
I'll transfer the coordinates to
the Transporter Room.
Where is Commander Data?
He has temporarily removed himself
from bridge duty, sir.
Your crew is excellently trained,
Captain. A tribute to your
leadership. Though I doubt their
extensive preparation will be
needed.
How so?
I do not expect "Captain" Riker
to present much of a challenge.
Mister Kolrami -- may I speak with
you in private?
I would like to know the root of
your prejudice for my
second-in-command.
Captain, I don't --
Mister Kolrami -- you have been
nothing but denigrating and
abusive of Commander Riker since
boarding this ship. I should like
an explanation.
Having studied William Riker's
file prior to this assignment --
I have found him wanting.
In what regard?
His record is exemplary, but as
you well know, a starship captain
is not manufactured -- he, or she,
is born from inside -- from the
character of the individual.
My interviews have revealed a man
who displays circumstantially
inappropriate joviality, belying
the seriousness of his station.
Don't confuse style with intent.
Only a fool would question
Commander Riker's dedication to
Starfleet and the men and women
under his command. Riker is the
finest officer I have ever served
with.
We shall see if your faith is well
founded.
The test is if a crew will follow
where Commander Riker leads. His
joviality is the way he creates
that loyalty. And I'll match his
command style against your
statistics anytime.
Come in, please.
Data?
Counselor. Is something wrong?
That was going to be my question.
With my repository of knowledge,
I expected to perform better
against a humanoid life-form.
Some of our greatest advances have
come from analyzing failure.
While it can be ego-bruising --
Counselor -- I do not have an
"ego."
Yes... well, a loss... can be
disheartening --
Counselor -- I do not have a --
Data! There are two ways to
handle defeat. You can lose
confidence or you can learn from
your mistakes.
That is what troubles me. I made
no mistakes.
Hence, I have conducted a
diagnostic check of all of my
programs, and now I am cross-checking
with the ship's computer.
Is all of that necessary?
I believe so. I have proven to
be vulnerable, and at the present
time, skepticism must be awarded
my deductions.
That is why you haven't been on
the bridge.
Yes, the captain would be ill
advised to rely upon my judgement.
Data, I think you're really
overreacting. I'm sure you're
all right.
I, however, am not sure.
What's that?
My experiment from the Enterprise.
Wes?
It dealt with high-energy plasma
reactions --
-- with anti-matter.
You went back to the Enterprise
just to get this... Wes, you
cheated.
No, sir. You told me to
improvise.
The hard part's gonna be
calibrating the thermal curve
required to start a controlled
reaction.
Assuming you can -- can you
regulate the reaction?
There's just enough crystal to
do it.
We plan to channel the reaction
through the chips.
Are we good?
Better than good. Great.
Brilliant.
This is going to be fun.
Carry on.
Come in, please.
All right, Data, enough of this.
Doctor?
How long are you going to sit
sulking like Achilles in his tent?
I am running diagnostic --
You might be able to sell Troi
with that story, but not me.
You're smarting because you got
beat. Well, it happens.
No, Doctor, this is not ego. I
am concerned about giving the
captain unsound advice.
I wish I'd never maneuvered you
into playing that damn game. I'm
sorry.
For what? It is done, and perhaps
just as well. This has indicated
that I am damaged in some fashion.
I must find the malfunction.
The simulation begins in one hour.
You'll have warp drive, Captain,
though it may not be what you
expected.
I'd say that calls for an
explanation.
Sir, we'll be able to give you
warp one...
-- for just under two seconds.
Well, not enough for an escape
but used as a surprise, sufficient
for gaining a strategic advantage.
Sir, all of this is "theoretical."
And if the theory fails to pay
off?
Ever driven a Grenthemen Water
Hopper?
Yes.
Ever popped the clutch?
You're telling me we'll stall
the Hathaway.
... and the Enterprise will waltz
over and pulverize us.
Now, let me see if I fully
understand this. You're
suggesting that Commander Data
is suffering from a profound loss
of confidence, and you feel that
only I can restore the balance.
Yes, sir.
Both Deanna and I have tried,
Captain, and we're not getting
through to him.
Don't you think you both might
be overreacting? Data is not
capable of the emotions you are
assigning to him.
The effect is the same whether
it's caused by human emotions or
android algorithms. Data's not
on the bridge, and I don't think
he's going to be on the bridge
until we find some way to address
his problem.
I am less than an hour away from
a battle simulation, and I must
handhold an android?
The burdens of command.
Come in, please.
Commander, I require your presence
on the bridge.
Captain, with all due respect,
perhaps it would be better if you
choose another to serve as your
first --
Data, you are my first officer.
I have not been able to isolate
the problem. I might make a
mistake.
Yes, you might. But that does
not alter your duty -- to this
ship, and to me.
Do you know how to formulate a
premise?
Yes.
Then formulate one now: How do
I handle Riker and the Hathaway?
I'll await your answer on the
bridge.
Commander, it is possible to
commit no mistakes -- and still
lose.
That is not a weakness. That is
"life".
Thank you, Captain, I believe I
understand.
And Data, leave the hesitation
and self-doubt in your quarters.
I have several examples of
Commander Riker's battle
technique. At the Academy, he
calculated a sensory blind spot
on a Tholian vessel and hid
within it during a battle
simulation. And as a lieutenant
aboard the Potemkin, his solution
to a crisis was to shut down all
power, and hang over a planet's
magnetic pole, thus confusing his
opponent's sensors.
And from these specifics, what
general conclusion can you
extrapolate?
Only twenty-one percent of the
time does he rely upon traditional
tactics.
So the captain must be prepared
for extreme cunning.
Counselor, Commander Riker will
assume that we have made this
analysis, and knowing that we know
his methods, he will alter them.
But knowing that we know that he
knows that we know he might choose
to return to his usual pattern.
You're over-analyzing. Human
nature cannot be denied.
What kind of man is Commander
Riker?
He is a fighter.
Yes.
The weaker his position, the more
aggressive will be his posture.
And he won't give up.
Then despite whatever logical
choices he is offered, he must
be --
-- The man that he is. Yes.
Is that a failing in humans?
You'll have to decide that for
yourself.
Screen on.
The hunt begins, Number One.
We're ready -- just remember,
Enterprise -- Captain Riker has
never lost.
Begin!
Screen off. Set course
two-two-three mark two-five-seven,
full impulse power. Initiate
Kumeh maneuver.
The Kumeh maneuver -- why are they
starting out with such a
recognizable ploy?
He's teasing -- wants us to reveal
our tactics on his terms. Worf?
Counter with Talupian stratagem
on instrument sighting.
Agreed. Three-quarters impulse,
full on my command. Ensign Nagel,
maximum shields.
Mister Worf, prepare your little
surprise.
Course three-one-seven mark
seven-three. Present minimal
aspect. Ready warp one, optimal
spread on simulated torpedoes.
Captain -- Romulan warship
approaching fast from astern!
What the -- ?!
He came from nowhere, sir!
Bring us about, Ensign -- maximum
shields!
Disengage modified beams.
Weapon-systems full -- lock on!
Open a hailing frequency.
I can't, sir.
There's nothing there.
Warp three, evasive!
Disengage weapons, re-engage
modified beam.
He is quite good.
He is the best!
Computer reports simulated damage
to several aft decks. Repair time
three-point-six days.
How did he do that?
Mister Worf must have overridden
our sensor codes and played some
holographic games. Data, input
a new code.
Attack posture, circumvental
attitude. Prepare beams for
photon mode.
Bye-bye, Hathaway.
Computers report heavy damage to
Enterprise, sir.
They're moving off. Why not go
after them?
Because they're not through coming
after us! Geordi, Wesley --
prepare warp jump.
There are no guarantees here, sir.
There never are, Lieutenant. I'm
going to trust your expertise.
Secure your stations, gentlemen.
Stand by for my signal.
Ready photon torpedoes.
Captain, sensors picking up a
Ferengi warship closing at warp
five.
Did you input that new code?
Yes, sir!
Mister Worf -- I didn't give you
enough credit, continue the
simulation.
Divert all power to shields!
Sever modified beams, engage
phasers and target!
Stay between the Hathaway and the
Ferengi!
That's no ghost attacking the
Enterprise. That's real!
We must assist, sir!
With what?! We have no offensive
weapons!
Where are my weapons?
Unavailable, sir! We cannot
disengage the modified beams --
the connections have been fused!
We must retreat!
Unacceptable! I have crew on the
Hathaway.
Captain, the Ferengi have broken
off their attack.
Drop shields. Transport the away
team aboard.
Transporter functions gone, sir!
Shields reduced to one-fifth
intensity.
Use their moment of indecision
to escape!
I have forty crewmembers --
-- Who should be sacrificed to
save a thousand! Acceptable
tactical losses, considering the
circumstances.
Not to me!
Notify Starfleet -- priority.
Hail Ferengi on my command.
Formulate alternatives.
As the Starfleet observer I am
ordering you to withdraw!
I am the captain of this vessel!
Your order is nullified!
Ferengi on Main Viewer.
I am Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of
the Federation Starship, USS
Enterprise. Why have you attacked
my ship?
Why was your ship combative with
another Federation vessel of
"lesser" design? Why do you now
protect your former target? What
is its value to you?
Our probes indicate you were aware
of our approach, yet took no
action.
Your answers will dictate our
response.
I have refrained from launching
a counter-attack in the hope that
we can resolve this peacefully.
Our probes indicate that you are
crippled, and the ship you protect
has no weaponry, no light-speed
drive, and only scarce crew.
This makes no sense to us.
Unless it contains something very
valuable?
I am Bractor, leader of the
Ferengi attack vessel Kreechta.
I shall have the secret of the
other Federation ship. If you
surrender it to me, I will allow
your Enterprise to leave unharmed.
You have ten of your minutes.
Sir, they're massing a surge of
power. We're being scanned...
they've locked on!
Data?
Our shields will not
withstand another assault.
Then there are no options.
Retreat or die.
Captain's log, supplemental. Due
to a grave miscalculation on my
part, the Enterprise has been
subjected to a withering attack
by the Ferengi. I find myself
with little time to decide the
fate of forty of my crew stranded
aboard the derelict Hathaway.
I'm open to suggestions.
Captain, we are now capable of
launching a limited number of
photon torpedoes.
I have given you my advice,
Captain. The Hathaway is
expendable.
Commander Riker is hailing, sir.
On screen. Have you been
monitoring communications, Number
One?
Yes, sir. And Kolrami's right.
You must save the Enterprise.
You will be left defenseless.
When Bractor closes in, we'll hit
our warp drive and take our
chances.
Your what?!
We have a limited, two-second warp
capability.
Impossible! That ship was
rendered warp inactive!
I told you he was the best.
I should wish to hear about this
later, but now I need to work
something out with Data.
Premise: The Ferengi wish to
capture the Hathaway believing
it to be of value. Therefore,
we must remove the ship from their
field of interest.
They will soon relocate it after
a two-second warp and --
There is a way. Are you with
us, Number One?
Yes, sir. We're all here --
anxiously waiting for you to pull
another rabbit out of your hat.
Data.
At the captain's signal, we will
fire four photon torpedoes
directly at the Hathaway. A
millisecond before detonation,
the computer will trigger your
warp jump.
I think I hate this plan.
Data, we don't even know for sure
if our warp jump will work.
If the warp engines should fail
to function, the result could
be... unfortunate.
Very unfortunate... we will be
dead.
Captain Riker, I can't order you
to do this...
What the hell. Nobody said life
was safe.
The advantage is that it will
appear from the Kreechta's
perspective -- as though you were
destroyed in the explosion.
That will only deceive them for
a few minutes. Their sensors will
soon locate us.
A few minutes is all we need,
Mister Worf, because you're going
to prepare a surprise for them.
Then we are agreed; on my mark
in four minutes.
Remember, Geordi, if the
implementation is off by a
millisecond, the Hathaway will
not survive.
Data, that's the one part of this
plan that we're all absolutely
sure about.
Are we ready, Number One?
Good luck to both of you.
Bractor.
I will wait no longer, Picard.
You needn't, Bractor. The answer
-- is "no."
Your actions have been wholly
criminal, and you will not profit
by them.
You are a fool.
How can you stop us?
You feel the Hathaway has value?
Well, I deny you your prize.
Fire!
Destroy your own rather than
endure the ignominy of defeat and
capture?
I did not think the Federation
had such iron.
You had no claim to that ship --
it was ours to destroy.
As you are ours to destroy!
You can try.
Enterprise targeted, Leader.
Leader! There is another
Federation ship closing -- a
starship!
Maximum shields! We've been
outmaneuvered. Retreat!
Captain, our sensors show no
Federation starship nearby.
Of course not, Mister Burke. That
was Klingon guile.
You made it, Number One. Smooth
ride?
Different!
We'll lock on and pick you up.
With pleasure.
I must admit -- your Commander
Riker has acquitted himself
quite... admirably.
And Captain... so have you. My
report to Starfleet will be quite
favorable.
Thank you, Mister Kolrami.
Initiate recovery procedures,
continue repairs, plot a course
for the nearest starbase.
Captain's log, supplemental. With
the transporter repaired and my
crew safely back aboard, we have
officially ended the first
Starfleet battle simulation.
Why have you suspended the game?
Because this is not a rematch --
you have made a mockery of me.
Data, you beat him!
No, sir -- it is a stalemate.
No game of Strategema has ever
gone this high.
What did you do?
I simply altered my "premise" for
playing.
Explain.
Working under the assumption that
Kolrami is attempting to win, it
is reasonable to assume that he
expects me to play for the same
goal.
You weren't?
No. I was playing only for a
standoff -- a "draw." While
Kolrami was dedicated to winning,
I was able to pass up obvious
avenues of advancement and settle
for a balance.
Theoretically, I should be able
to challenge him indefinitely.
Then you have beaten him.
A matter of perspective. In the
strictest sense I did not win.
Data!
I busted him up.
