Captain's Log: Stardate 47304.2.
The Enterprise has arrived at
Kesprytt Three in order to
evaluate an unusual request on the
part of the Kes for associate
membership in the Federation.
She's been very secretive... every
time I ask her about it or try to
edge around the subject, she
changes the subject. Personally,
I think she's in love.
Mmmmm.
Didn't you hear me? I said, she's
in love.
Yes?
Is that all you can say?
What would you like me to say?
I'm very pleased for them both.
Both of who?
The two... people we were
discussing.
You don't have the slightest idea
who I'm talking about, do you?
No... no, I'm sorry... but I
really don't.
I'll try not to take that
personally... I've been talking
about Nurse Ogawa and Ensign
Markson for almost fifteen
minutes.
Oh, now it hasn't been that long.
How would you know? You haven't
heard a thing I've said since I
got here.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Are you worried about this mission
with the Kes?
Not worried exactly... just
uneasy. This notion of admitting
half of their planet to the
Federation while leaving the other
half out...
Well, first of all, the Kes are
not half the planet, they're
almost three-quarters of it. And
the Prytt are not being left out --
they simply don't want any outside
contact with the Federation or
anyone else.
Every member of the Federation has
entered as a unified world... and
that unity said something about
them... that they had resolved
certain social and political
problems at home and were ready to
join a larger community.
From all indications, the Kes are
a very unified, very progressive
people.
But the Prytt are not. They are
reclusive to the point of
xenophobia.
Think about Earth -- what if one
of the old nation-states, say
Australia, had decided not to join
the World Government in twenty-one
fifty? Would that have
disqualified us from being a
Federation member?
That analogy is not entirely --
Riker to Captain.
Go ahead, Number One.
We've received word from
Ambassador Mauric that he's ready
to see you and Doctor Crusher.
Inform him we're on our way.
Acknowledged.
Thank you for breakfast.
Wait until tomorrow... I have
something very special planned.
It's a Vulcan dish -- that's all
I'll tell you.
Captain. Doctor. I have the
coordinates of Ambassador Mauric's
chambers.
Let's not keep them waiting,
Mister Worf.
Enterprise to Kes Security Relay
Station One. We're ready to
commence transport.
Acknowledged, Enterprise. We have
lowered our defense shield.
Confirmed.
Energize.
This is Security Relay Station
One. We are ready to receive your
Captain and Medical Officer.
This is the Enterprise. We have
completed the transport sequence.
You should have them.
Negative, Enterprise. They are
not here.
Beverly... Beverly...
What happened?
I don't know.
The last thing I remember... was
beginning the transport...
I would assume that we're on
Kesprytt... in some kind of
prison cell.
The question is why? I can't
imagine that Ambassador Mauric
would --
Jean-Luc.
What is it?
I'm not sure.
It's an implant... looks like it
might be connected directly to the
brainstem.
Some kind of coercive device... ?
Whatever they are... I doubt
they're designed for our health.
Why are we being held?
If you tell us why you've taken us
hostage, we might be able to --
You are not hostages. You are
prisoners.
Prisoners. By whose authority?
You are being held under the
authority of the Prytt Security
Ministry. The charge is
conspiring with the enemy.
The enemy... you mean the Kes.
We are not fools. We are aware of
the Federation attempt to
establish a military alliance with
the Kes. It will not be
tolerated.
Your information is in error.
There are no plans to enter into
any --
There is no point in trying to
mislead us, Captain. The devices
which have been implanted in your
cerebral cortexes will soon be
calibrated to your psi-wave
patterns. At that time, we will
get all the information we need.
And you will discover that we're
telling the truth.
We shall see.
There is nothing wrong with the
Transporter. I have run a
complete diagnostic and checked
all the targeting components.
Then what happened to the Captain
and Doctor Crusher?
Commander. The Transporter sensor
log shows an unusual concentration
of antigraviton particles in the
emitter coil. These particles do
not occur naturally -- something
must have interfered with the
Transporter.
Interfered?
A concentration of antigraviton
particles would suggest a tractor
beam. It might have deflected the
Transporter beam to a different
set of coordinates.
Is there a way to locate those
coordinates?
No, sir.
However, it may be possible to
determine the point of origin of
the tractor beam itself.
Well, that's a start.
The tractor beam originated from
somewhere within the Prytt
Alliance.
The Prytt... things just got a
little more complicated.
Can we scan for them?
Prytt territory is shielded by a
high-energy forcefield. It cannot
be penetrated by our sensors.
Why would the Prytt want Captain
Picard and Doctor Crusher?
I don't know. And it's not going
to be easy to find out... the
Prytt have consistently refused
all outside contact and somehow I
don't think they're going to be
eager to start now. We'll have to
work through the Kes.
Contact Ambassador Mauric and tell
him we need a meeting right away.
Aye, sir.
What?
What?
You're staring at me.
Sorry. I was just wondering how
long you were going to keep at
this.
As long as it takes. With any
luck, there may be a structural
flaw that would allow us to
escape.
Right.
The important thing during any
confinement is to think positively
and not to give up hope... there
is a way out of every box... there
is a solution to every puzzle...
it is simply a matter of --
Damn.
Well, at least this means we're
not going to starve to death.
What it means is that they plan on
keeping us here for a while...
I'm starting to think negatively,
Jean-Luc.
My tricorder!
Does it work?
Yes. But something's been added
to the main directory.
It's a map...
An escape route. That guard must
be working for the Kes...
Possibly.
What else could it be?
It could be part of a very
carefully laid trap.
If you ask me, I'd rather take my
chances out there.
Agreed. Is there a way to open
the cell door?
Yes. The code's been entered.
On behalf of my government, I
would like to take this
opportunity to present our
profound apologizes to you
regarding this unfortunate
incident.
That's very kind, Ambassador. But
I don't think anyone here blames
you or the Kes government for
what's happened.
Our primary concern is not to
assign blame, but to recover our
missing officers.
Of course.
We are prepared to insert a
hostage rescue team into the Prytt
capital city on three hours
notice.
Ambassador... we haven't even
tried a diplomatic effort yet.
I'd rather not use force until
we've exhausted all other options.
I don't believe we have any...
diplomatic options, Commander.
There are no formal relations with
the Prytt...
... no ambassadors... there's
simply no way to contact them.
Surely you must have some means of
communication in case of a
planetary emergency.
We have never had need of such a
system.
We can determine their
communications frequencies and
establish a link.
Allow me to be blunt.
The Prytt are a fanatical,
xenophobic people, with little
regard for civilized discourse.
Even if you do establish a
communications link with them, it
will be a complete waste of time.
How long has it been since your
last diplomatic contact?
Almost a century.
Then it's possible that they've
changed over the years.
We have had other... less formal
contacts with the Prytt --
contacts that I cannot discuss.
But I can assure you, they have
changed very little.
Mister Ambassador... with all due
respect, I feel I should make an
attempt to communicate with the
Prytt before I sanction the use of
force.
Of course, Commander. In the
meantime, I will continue to make
preparations for a rescue attempt.
Agreed.
I do have one request. We believe
that the Prytt obtained their
information about the transport of
your captain and doctor through a
breach in our communications
network. If I could set up a base
of operations here on the
Enterprise, I would feel much more
secure.
Mister Worf will help you.
Thank you.
You first.
Is there a problem, Ambassador?
Probably not. I am simply
securing the area.
I can assure you there is no need.
I'm sure you're right.
This will do nicely.
As Security Chief of the
Enterprise, I would be glad to
assist you in any way possible --
There's no need. We'll take care
of everything.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Is there a problem, Ambassador?
Probably not. I am simply
securing the area.
I can assure you there is no need.
I'm sure you're right.
Well. This will do nicely.
As Security Chief of the
Enterprise, I would be glad to
assist you in any way possible --
There's no need. We'll take care
of everything.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Someone obviously put a lot of
time and effort into this.
It might have been the guard's
personal escape route.
You're assuming he's a Kes agent.
Seems logical.
There must be a lava flow or a hot
spring somewhere near by.
It's a lava flow... about thirty
meters beneath us.
We're supposed to head this way.
I smell gas...
This whole chamber is filled with
pockets of a methanogenic
compound...
Can we get through it?
I think so...
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
There seems to be a fairly regular
pattern to these eruptions... if
we're careful we should be able to
navigate through them.
Say when...
Now...
The eruptions have stopped...
The gas is building up!
I have scanned the entire Prytt
communications system and I
believe this is the primary access
module for the central government.
Can you determine which of these
com links is connected to their
prime minister's office?
I believe so. However, the Prytt
have no link designed for extraterritorial
communications. Our
hail may come as a surprise to
them.
Well, they're going to have to
adjust. Open a channel.
This is Prime Minister Horath's
headquarters. How can I be of
service?
This is Commander William T.
Riker of the Federation starship
Enterprise. I know this is an
unusual way to --
The Enterprise? You mean the ship
in orbit?
That's right.
Why are you on this com-link?
Well, we didn't know how to
contact your government directly,
so we had to start somewhere. Now
if I could talk with your--
Did you get authorization for this
communication from the Security
Ministry?
No. As I said, we didn't know how
to contact you so--
I cannot participate in an
unauthorized communication.
Not very friendly are they?
No, sir.
Sir. We are being hailed... it is
the Prytt Security Council.
Looks like we got somebody's
attention. On screen.
Enterprise, this is Security
Minister Lorin. You will
immediately cease all attempts at
communication with our people.
Minister, we've been trying to
contact someone in your
government. It appears that
you've detained two of our
officers and we would like to
discuss this situation.
There is nothing to discuss. If
you do not terminate these
transmissions, we will be forced
to take aggressive action against
your ship.
Their weapon systems pose no
threat to the Enterprise.
Just the same, let's keep the
shields up for the time being.
Aye, sir.
Is there a problem, Commander?
Our efforts with the Prytt just
ran into a wall.
I am sorry. But perhaps this will
brighten your spirits -- we have
freed your Captain and doctor.
What?
They were being held in a prison
just outside the Prytt capital.
One of our operatives was able to
arrange their escape.
Where are they now?
They should be en route to the Kes
border. Our operative provided
them with a detailed map and
instructions on where to go.
How do you plan to get them across
the border?
At the moment, that information is
confidential. But trust us... we
do have a plan.
Ambassador... I'm afraid I must
insist that you provide us with
more information.
I understand your concern, of
course. But I would feel more...
comfortable discussing operational
details in a... less public
environment.
Certainly. We can step into the
Ready Room.
I would prefer... the quarters you
provided me. They're safer.
All right.
There's no way out of here...
Maybe we took a wrong turn...
Me too...
What?
I'm thirsty too.
I didn't say anything about being
thirsty.
I heard you. You said, "I'm very
thirsty."
I was thinking about it, but I
didn't say anything.
You were thinking it...
The transceivers. Lorin said they
would align themselves to our psi
wave patterns...
The implants might be transmitting
our thoughts.
What am I thinking?
I don't know.
I can't hear your thoughts,
either. Maybe it was just a
fluke.
For now, I'm afraid we have more
immediate concerns. Does the map
indicate a way out of here?
Yes. We go up.
There's a ledge about thirty
meters up that connects to another
tunnel which should lead to the
surface.
Right.
I heard that.
They weren't words exactly... I
suddenly had this... sense of
fear... a fear of heights.
So much for it being a fluke.
What a strange sensation... your
thoughts just appeared in my mind.
If you sensed fear of heights, you
sensed pretty accurately.
Come on. We've done this
before... it's just like on the
Holodeck.
One hand-hold at a time... nothing
too fast... just a slow, gentle
climb.
Right.
I see you've done some
redecorating.
Just a few pieces of equipment we
needed for security reasons. You
understand.
Certainly.
He is all right.
Ambassador... how do you plan to
get my people out of Prytt
territory?
You must realize that what I am
about to tell you cannot leave
this room.
For some time now, we have had
certain... friends among the
Prytt. Citizens who have realized
that the long struggle between our
two peoples can only end when the
Prytt government is made to see
reason.
You've recruited a few Prytt
spies.
A crude, but accurate term. These
friends will be waiting for your
Captain and Doctor when they reach
the village of Ohn-Kor near the
Kes border. The map we provided
your officers will take them to a
tavern there.
Forgive me, Ambassador, but is it
wise to send two human fugitives
in Starfleet uniforms into a Prytt
village?
The danger is minimal. Our
operatives control most of the
town.
Once they have made contact with
Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher,
our friends will escort them
across the Kes border.
I'd still feel better if they
could rendezvous with your
operatives in a less public place.
Commander, I assure you we know
what we're doing. We have a great
deal of experience in dealing with
the Prytt. And we would hardly
risk the safety of your people...
after all -- we're still hoping
you'll recommend our entrance into
the Federation.
One of us is hungry.
That would be me.
Try to think of something else.
You're making me hungry.
What would you like me to think
about?
Something other than a large bowl
of vegetable soup.
My grandmother used to make it...
with beans and peas and carrots --
Beverly.
Sorry.
I am not being unreasonable.
I didn't say you were. I may have
thought it, but there's a
difference.
You're right. We can't react to
every random thought that crosses
the other person's mind.
It's astonishing how much...
clutter there is in our
consciousness. Odd memories
coming to the surface... bits of
half-remembered songs...
Stray day-dreams... scattered
minutiae... I wonder how true
telepaths sift through it all.
How can they get to what someone's
really thinking if their minds are
constantly churning all this
flotsam to the surface?
That is not funny.
I just wanted to see if you were
listening.
I think the link is getting
stronger.
Maybe we should put some distance
between us... that might weaken
it.
Not that I'm tired of hearing your
most intimate thoughts...
Certainly not.
Jean-Luc...
What happened?
I don't know... I suddenly felt a
wave of nausea.
Me too.
I don't see anything wrong with
either of us.
Maybe the air is toxic...
The same thing... but when you
moved back toward me... I felt
better.
It would seem we're stuck with
each other.
What's wrong?
I can't tell if we're supposed to
go over this hill... or that one.
The topography on this map is a
little vague.
Let me see.
This way.
You don't really know, do you?
What?
You're acting like you know
exactly which way to go... but
you're just guessing. Do you do
this all the time?
No.
But... there are times when it's
important for a Captain to give
the appearance of confidence.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I
couldn't resist...
I'm beginning to realize that you
seem to always have some...
acerbic remark on the tip of your
tongue.
At least I've trained myself not
to say it anymore. When I was a
little girl, my mouth was always
landing me in trouble with my
parents... my teachers...
Your friends... and someone named
Tom Norris... ?
That's right. We had one date...
which I brought to an abrupt halt
with the words... "Is that a beard
or is your face dirty?"
"Or is your face dirty?"
There's something more... you're
laughing, but...
You actually feel... embarrassed
about that incident.
Yes.
I thought I was being cute... but
I really hurt him.
That was a long time ago. And it
taught me a valuable lesson.
This... sharing of thoughts and
feelings... it's compelling in a
strange way...
Very.
We'd better get going.
I don't think so, either. Maybe
there's another way to reach the
village.
No. We'd have to backtrack
several kilometers to find another
way over this ridge.
The border's only two kilometers
east of here... there's a
forcefield protecting it, but
we'll have to find a way to deal
with that when we get there.
All right.
Is something wrong?
Have a seat.
Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher
did not show up at the designated
rendezvous point.
Do you know what happened to them?
No. We have no idea what happened
to them.
We find it strange that your
officers would follow the escape
plan so precisely -- but then fail
to make a crucial rendezvous with
our operatives.
It is possible they have been
recaptured.
Our sources would have informed us
instantly if that had happened.
But of course, if they weren't
captured... if they simply... made
a different rendezvous... we might
not ever know about it.
A different rendezvous? I'm not
sure what you mean.
Of course you're not. You
wouldn't know if your Captain and
Doctor were meeting secretly with
the Prytt.
Meeting in order to set up a
military alliance with the
Federation...
What?
It was a clever scheme... first
you pretend to "lose" your
officers during transport... then
you ask us for help... and get us
to expose several of our
undercover operatives in the
process. But what you didn't
expect was for us to get your
people out of prison so quickly.
They needed more time... more time
to plot the destruction of the Kes
with their new Prytt friends.
This is ridiculous. You're
starting to see conspiracies
everywhere. We were invited here
by the Kes, why would we want to
ally ourselves with the Prytt?
Why indeed?
You can believe what you want...
we're going to find our people
with or without your help.
Then I believe it's time for us to
be leaving the Enterprise.
Just make sure you take all that
junk with you.
No luck.
I'm beginning to think there's not
a single thing on this planet we
can eat.
Well... if we're lucky, we'll be
back on the Enterprise by this
time tomorrow and you can plant
yourself in front of a replicator
with a knife and fork.
Remember that Vulcan dish I
promised you for breakfast? I was
just thinking...
You hate having breakfast with me.
That's not true.
Yes, it is. As soon as I said,
"breakfast" I heard you say, "I
hate that."
That's not quite what I meant...
Well, what did you mean?
I simply... don't like...
... don't like what I've been
choosing for breakfast.
No, no. It's... just that I feel
breakfast should be... a simple
meal... and recently they seem to
have become more elaborate.
Tea and scones. That's all you
really want, isn't it? Tea and
scones. Why didn't you say so?
It didn't seem that important...
You don't like those elaborate
meals either.
I usually prefer something simple
myself... but somehow I thought
you might enjoy more variety.
Well, it's tea and scones for both
of us from now on.
I love firelight.
I love firelight.
There's something about the
flame... the smell of the
smoke... I've always felt it's
intoxicating in a way...
I remember when Jack and I took
Wesley on his first camping trip
to Balfour Lake. Wesley kept
throwing manta leaves in the fire
to watch them pop... Jack kept
telling him...
What?
Jean-Luc... I heard you. Don't
push it away.
Beverly, please. I don't want to
talk about this right now.
When I said, "Jack and I"... I
could feel this sudden wave of...
something.
I never knew you felt that way.
Didn't you?
I guess I always knew there was...
an attraction between us, right
from the start. But I had no idea
how strongly you felt...
Why didn't you ever tell me you
were in love with me?
You were married to my best
friend.
At first, it seemed like a
harmless infatuation... something
more hormonal than emotional. But
then...
But then as the months went by...
and the three of us starting
spending more time together...
I began to realize that it was
something more.
It wasn't right... and I knew I
wouldn't act on it... but I
couldn't help the way I felt.
And when Jack died... you felt
guilty.
I felt guilty before he died...
having those kind of feelings for
my best friend's wife. Then...
later, after the accident... I
told myself that no matter what
happened I would never let you
know how I felt.
You didn't want to feel as if you
were...
Betraying my friend...
That's why you didn't want me on
the Enterprise seven years ago.
I didn't know how I would react.
But gradually, I found that I
didn't feel that way anymore...
that twenty years was indeed a
long time...
And now we're friends...
Yes... friends.
We still have a lot of ground to
cover tomorrow. We should get
some sleep.
Right.
Ambassador. Thank you for coming.
Commander.
We're about to clear up this
misunderstanding once and for all.
Hail Minister Lorin, please.
Aye, sir.
Enterprise, I have warned you
about these unauthorized
communications...
Yes, I know. But I think it's
about time we all sat down
together and tried to work this
out. I have Ambassador Mauric
here and --
That is your misfortune. We have
nothing to say to either of you.
Commander... I know you're working
with the Prytt. Putting on a
little show like that for my
benefit does neither of us any
good.
We'll see.
Mister Worf...
I think there's someone waiting
for us in the Observation Lounge.
I should have known that anyone
willing to deal with the Kes would
be capable of such an outrage.
I'm sorry I had to resort to these
drastic measures, Minister, but
you left me little choice.
Don't pretend that the two of you
are enemies. It is too late for
a charade.
If that is an attempt to hide your
military alliance with the
Federation, you needn't bother.
I already know far more than you
can imagine.
Let's all just sit down and try to
talk about what's happened to
Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher.
I will not sit at a table with...
him.
No more than I would sit with her.
All right... then we'll stand.
The important thing is that we
start talking.
I am not authorized to talk with
a Kes official.
Then talk to me. Where are my
officers?
As if you don't already know.
I'm all right.
We are already aware of your plan
to use Federation technology to
build new attack satellites. You
will find that we are prepared for
them.
An interesting, if pointless lie.
I would rather discuss your own
plans to use Federation aid to
stage a takeover of Kolrod Island.
We have been over this before.
Kolrod clearly belongs to the
Prytt who originally--
That's it.
I can see that... diplomacy is not
going to get us anywhere today,
and I don't have time for an
extended negotiation session. So
it's time to lay all the cards on
the table.
That means it's time to stop
fooling around and get serious.
You're concerned that the Kes are
about to be admitted into an
associative membership with the
Federation.
Correct.
As First Officer of the Enterprise
I think I can promise you that is
not going to happen. The Kes will
be denied membership.
You do not have the authority to
do that. Despite whatever games
you may have played with the Prytt
since your arrival, we still plan
on taking our petition directly to
the Federation Council. They will
listen to our--
They will listen to the report of
the Enterprise Captain and his
First Officer. And I can tell you
right now that the First Officer's
report will go something like
this:
"Kesprytt is a deeply troubled
world with social, political, and
military problems that it has yet
to resolve. The Kes, although a
friendly and democratic people,
are driven by suspicion,
deviousness, and paranoia. In the
opinion of this officer, they are
not ready for membership."
Now to the matter of our missing
officers...
They are still charged with
spying, Commander. I have heard
nothing here which would alter
that.
Then maybe you should consider
this: If anything happens to them,
Starfleet is going to want a full
investigation. That means more
starships will be sent to
Kesprytt... and those ships are
going to want answers... which
means they'll be putting your
country under a very large and
very uncomfortable microscope.
Remember how unhappy you were when
we contacted just one of your
people without authorization?
Well, think of what it'll be like
when ten starships start looking
for answers. They'll be
contacting hundreds of your
people... they'll conduct massive
sensor sweeps... they might even
start sending down Away Teams.
And all because you wouldn't help
me find my missing officers...
I think I can use the tricorder to
set-up a multiphase pulse. That
should weaken the field enough for
us to get through.
No, no. The modulation frequency
should be in the upper-harmonic
range.
Right.
I'm going as fast as I can.
Minister, we have the human
female. The male is standing in
Kes territory.
Very well. Transmit their
coordinates to the Enterprise
Transporter Room.
Understood.
Thank you, Minister. Now, if
you'll excuse me...
Mauric is determined to take his
protest to the Federation Council,
but I don't think he'll get very
far.
I tend to agree, Number One.
Did I miss something?
I know... I know... you're
absolutely right.
That was wonderful.
My pleasure.
Don't take this the wrong way,
Jean-Luc... but I'm glad we're not
joined at the hip anymore.
Were you getting tired of my
company?
Just tired of bumping into you
every thirty seconds. I was
beginning to feel like you were
part of my uniform.
Champagne... ?
What shall we drink to?
Our... freedom.
Freedom.
Penny for your thoughts.
I was just thinking... that as
distracting as it was... I was
beginning to get used to...
"hearing" your thoughts.
So was I. It was very...
intimate.
You know... last night... I woke
up...
Oh?
I was awake for several hours.
And thanks to the implant, I got
to "hear" some very interesting
dreams of yours.
A man can't be held responsible
for what his mind does when he's
asleep.
What about when he's awake?
So now that we've had this...
unique experience... what do we do
now?
What do you mean?
You know exactly what I mean.
No I don't. The implant's been
removed, remember?
I mean now that we know how we
each feel... perhaps we shouldn't
be afraid to explore those
feelings...
I'm not afraid... but I'm also not
ready.
Good-night.
Good-night.
