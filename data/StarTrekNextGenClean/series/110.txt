Captain's log, stardate 41723.9.
In response to a Starfleet order
we are in the Xendi Sabu star
system having rendezvoused with
a Ferengi vessel which has
requested a meeting. Although...
... we arrived here and made
appropriate signals to the Ferengi
three days ago, they have so far
responded only with the message:
"Stand by, Enterprise."
Come!
You called for me?
Yes, Doctor. I've been feeling...
odd, lately. Fatigued. And now
I've got a headache.
A what?
Certainly you know what a
"headache" is, Doctor.
Of course. But I don't often
encounter one.
The reason for it seems fairly
obvious. What are these Ferengi
up to? "Stand by, Enterprise."
Stand by for what?
I can't find a thing wrong.
I can't either. But they could
be baiting some kind of trap...
With your head. I see nothing
physically wrong, but I want to
run additional scans in Sickbay.
Doctor, all I've got is...
... is an order to report to
Sickbay.
From the one person aboard who can
give you an order.
Captain from first officer.
They're finally sending a message.
On my way, Number One.
Sorry, Doctor. Duty calls.
They're prepared to talk, sir.
Have they given any hint what
they've been waiting for?
Negative on that, Captain. But
they have identified their Captain
as "Bok," DaiMon Bok.
If it's Bok I'm sensing, he seems
anxious to meet you, sir.
Me? Why me? I've never heard
of him.
You'll be able to see him now,
sir. They're willing to
communicate on visual.
A reminder of something we learned
the only other time we dealt with
Ferengi, sir -- their hearing is
very sensitive.
Yes, they could pick up even a
whisper being transmitted.
Consider ourselves reminded.
Open hailing frequencies.
Hailing frequencies open, sir.
Ferengi vessel! This is Captain
Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.
We are transmitting visually.
Is this THE Captain Picard?
Do we know each other?
I know you, Picard.
I'm afraid you have the advantage.
Is this... Bok?
I am Bok, DaiMon of the Ferengi.
I have asked you here to discuss
a mutual problem, Captain.
What problem is that, DaiMon Bok?
I insist on speaking of that
matter in person. Shall we meet
on your vessel or mine?
Hailing frequencies closed.
Captain, I sense considerable
deception on Bok's part. And
danger!
Then definitely, sir, you should
meet with him here. Keep him
under our control.
Now open, sir.
I appreciate your offer, DaiMon
Bok, and ask you to be our guests.
As you wish, Picard. Perhaps this
will begin a new era of
cooperation for both our peoples.
In one Earth hour, then?
One hour, Bok. End transmission.
I can't believe they're coming
here!
They agreed a bit too easily.
Then, in one hour we'll know why.
Are you accustomed to always
getting your way, Doctor?
When my way makes sense, Captain.
There are still forty minutes
before the Ferengi beam over; I'll
have these scans done in ten.
A lot of effort for something as
simple as a headache.
"As simple?" It is my job to know
your condition intimately. You
should not have a headache unless
something is wrong.
It may be true that headaches were
once quite common... but this was
in the days before the brain was
charted...
... before we understood the nature
of pain... when we were suffering
from such things as the common
cold.
And so why do I have a headache,
Doctor?
I haven't the slightest damned
idea!
What's that?
Something doctors use when they
feel foolish over being proven
wrong.
Feel better?
The pain's gone.
Medical fakery -- the pain's
actually still there, just
cloaked. I'll want further exams
when this Ferengi matter is
settled.
Sir! You'll soon be getting an
intruder alert!
What? Wesley, if you've something
to report...
If you'll scan heading four-four
mark one-six-three, Lieutenant,
you'll find...
Intruder alert, sir...
I've got something, sir... very
distant.
It's an old style starship,
Constitution Class, heading this
way under impulse power, sir.
Says who?
Carry on.
Answer the first officer's
question.
Uh... says the long distance
sensors, sir. I was in
Engineering, playing around with
boosting sensor output...
Very interesting. Boosting it
how?
We will discuss it later.
I read it now, sir, as... a
Constitution Class starship...
coming this way under impulse
power.
Sir? What's wrong?
Nothing, just... a mild headache.
The correct procedure, Ensign,
would have been to signal your
finding to the bridge immediately.
Yes, sir.
Bringing it here personally...
... perhaps with the idea of being
on hand for the Ferengi beam
over... might have imperiled our
ship had something hostile been
approaching.
Yes, sir.
We are receiving no signal at all
from the approaching starship,
sir.
Time, sir.
Time? Oh, for the Ferengi to beam
over.
Do you see any problems connected
with this old starship coming in?
Suggest we'll be safer, sir, with
the Ferengi over here whatever
is happening.
Concur.
Stand by!
Let's bring them on visually.
Hailing frequencies open, sir.
Enterprise to Ferengi vessel.
We are standing by to receive you.
Ready to transfer ourselves over,
my dear Captain Picard.
Question... where shall we receive
you?
On your own bridge, of course.
Ferengi efficiency!
Data? What do you read?
Nothing, sir.
It could take a few moments,
Captain. If they build up their
beaming energy through capacitors
as seems likely...
We welcome you in peace to the
Enterprise, DaiMon Bok.
It is our pleasure, Captain
Picard. Might I introduce my
first officer, Kazago, and my
second, Rata?
This is my first officer,
Commander Riker...
And Counselor Troi. Second
Officer Data; Lieutenant LaForge;
security officers, Lieutenant Yar
and Lieutenant Worf; Ensign
Crusher.
Yes, we have heard you use
females...
Clothed females. Most
interesting.
They are that, sir.
And the android was mentioned too.
What is its price? We should like
to purchase it.
It... he is not for sale.
Commander Data is...is...
You wouldn't want him, Kazago.
He's second-hand merchandise.
Second-hand, sir?
Oh, of course! A human joke...
Excuse, Captain, but the
unidentified starship is
continuing in, still no signal
at all...
Think nothing of it.. It is under
our control.
One of our starships under your
control?
Do not be alarmed. It is a gift
from us.
With which we honor the "Hero of
Maxia."
Who?
Why you, Picard, of course! Don't
you remember the Battle of Maxia?
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I do not.
Data?
Captain, he may refer to an
incident which occurred seven
years ago in the Maxia Zeta star
system, where an unidentified
starship...
Unidentified?! That fine vessel
was Ferengi!
Which you destroyed, sir.
My sincere regrets, Bok, but that
ship did not identify itself.
It simply attacked; we defended
ourselves...
Such mistakes happen in space.
Hardly a "mistake," sir. Your
report showed it deliberately
attacked...
Do you want the arriving vessel
on Main Viewer, sir? It is only
a thousand kilometers away now...
Put it on your viewer.
Main Viewer.
We have set its controls to
automatically take station in
space next to your Enterprise.
There is no one aboard it.
When, with your permission, its
log will be downloaded into this
ship's records.
At a price...
No price!
No price?
For what purpose? What is this
all...
I felt something too, Captain.
What is it?
Sir... ?
Perhaps it is... his conscience?
Why do you say that?!
Bridge to Sickbay...
No... no, I'm fine...
It seemed as if... as if it were...
something from your past?
I'm all right now; I'm fine.
What is this all about?
It is about the battle I
mentioned, Captain. A gift in
honor of that occasion. Look at
that ship closely.
Enlarge please, LaForge.
It... it is the Stargazer. My old
ship, but how... where did you find
it?
It was a derelict, adrift in space
on the far side of this star
system. How it got there...
... is none of my business,
Captain. But now that vessel is
yours, if you wish to have it.
We are not selling it to him?
Call it an act of friendship.
At no cost!? Ugly. Very ugly!
Captain's log, stardate 41724.1.
Bok and his officers have returned
to their vessel, inviting us now
to officially take possession of
the Stargazer. They will stand
by while completing the
downloading of its log to us.
Like before?
Perhaps... it hit with more impact.
"Hit?"
Sorry, but anything could be
important.
You say you "felt" something
yourself?
I... believe so. Like... well, a
thought...
But rather... "mechanical" in
nature.
Are you sure it wasn't one of my
thoughts? At that moment, I was
remembering being at the helm of
the Stargazer, a maneuver being
made. We were hit...
Something's burning... I smell
smoke!
Don't you smell it?
There's nothing burning, Jean-Luc.
Ah... no, of course. It was... the
memory I was calling up.
Sorry.
Memory or... "nightmare?"
Well, it was strong, whatever it
was.
Ready, Number One.
Staff's waiting if Doctor Crusher
approves.
I'll do better than that -- I'll
go along.
But if they don't know what the
Ferengi are up to, what good is
it to sit there guessing?
Well... sometimes it determines
exactly what you don't know.
Dead on target, my friend. Would
you like to go up and listen to
them?
Some day. Right now I'm happy to
be here.
We were traveling at warp two
through the Maxia Zeta star system
when an unidentified starship
suddenly appeared and fired on
us! From close range.
Where did it come from?
It must've been lying in a deep
moon crater nearby. The first
attack damaged our shields, and
in the confusion it hit us a
second time.
No clue who they were?
No name, no reason...
Can you identify them, Vigo? Our
shields are failing; if they come
in again... ?
Sir? Who's Vigo?
Ah... my weapons officer on the
Stargazer.
I was getting caught up in this.
Then, with your shields failing,
sir...
I improvised. With the other ship
coming in for the kill...
... I ordered a sensor bearing,
and when it went into its return
arc...
... you performed what Starfleet
textbooks now call "The Picard
Maneuver."
What any good helmsman could have
done. I dropped into high warp...
... then stopped right off the
target vessel's bow...
... and fired everything I had.
By blowing into warp speed, you
appeared for an instant to be in
two places at once...
And our attacker fired on the
wrong one.
As you say, "what any good
helmsman could have done."
But you did it first...
A "save our skins" maneuver. The
Stargazer was on fire, finished.
We had to abandon ship, and limp
through space in shuttlecraft for
weeks before being picked up.
I haven't thought about it in
years...
The Ferengi are standing by for
us to take possession of the
Stargazer, sir.
I want to go over to her.
I understand, sir.
Once my people make certain she's
safe.
USS Stargazer. Constitution
Class. Starfleet Registry NCC
2893...
I activated the emergency power
cells...
Amazing they still work.
The rest of the ship is all clear
of surprises, Lieutenant Yar.
When I read about this ship at
the Academy, I never dreamed I'd
ever be on her.
Yar to Enterprise. All clear,
sir.
Thank you, Lieutenant. Captain?
Yes, Commander
Stargazer searched and secured,
sir. Give her my best.
I will that, Number One.
Energize!
Hello, old friend...
You'll find this intriguing,
Captain.
What do you find, Data?
Last entry was dated seven years
ago, sir. By you...
"We are forced to abandon our
starship. May she find her way
without us."
Apparently, she did.
How are you feeling, Captain?
Fine, Doctor.
Lieutenant Yar, run a structural
analysis on the Stargazer for
impulse tow.
Data, download all computers to
the Enterprise and file...
I'm going to my old cabin.
Try this, "Hero of Maxia."
DAMNNNN!
OHHHH!
Captain?
Another headache, sir?!
That worries me. I want you back
on the Enterprise.
Yes, but... my things here...
I'll see they're sent to your
Enterprise quarters.
Enterprise now taking possession
of Stargazer, Kazago.
Permission granted, Riker.
Actually it was quite a bargain,
Kazago. I thought the Ferengi
always made a profit on things.
Set sub-warp speed for towing,
LaForge.
Starfleet has responded to our
request, sir. A tug will
rendezvous with us and tow the
Stargazer back to Xendi Starbase
Nine.
Very well, Data.
How was it, Captain?
Strange, Number One. Like
visiting the house you grew up
in, but no one's home, except the
phantoms of the past...
It has troubled you?
Not as much as this damn headache,
Counselor. Take over, Number One.
Aye, sir.
What's wrong?
I wish I could say.
... shields weakening, Captain!
Torpedoes armed! Where are they?
Ohmygod, sir!
Fire! Fire!!
What is it, Data? Why all the
mystery?
It is the records of the Stargazer,
sir. What the Ferengi call the
"Battle of Maxia"...
It seems the Captain's personal
log contains a much different
version of that conflict than the
official historic account.
What are you saying?
It would appear that the starship
which Captain Picard attacked,
had in fact, been under a flag
of truce...
What?!
And apparently, the captain
destroyed the ship without notice
or provocation.
Impossible. What about the fire
aboard the Stargazer?
An accident in Engineering.
And the proof?
It is logged in his own voice.
Would you care to hear it?
Sir? Sir?
First officer's personal log,
stardate 41724.2. An unexpected
discovery made by Commander Data
in the downloaded log of the
Stargazer...
... appears to indicate Captain
Picard was guilty of falsifying
the report he made to Starfleet
concerning the Stargazer's last
voyage.
What does this mean?
I don't know, sir. That sounds
like your voice.
Don't you know it is, Number One?
No, sir, I don't. I refuse to
believe you could have said that.
... and I admit I must have
mistaken their subspace antenna
for a weapons cluster.
Unfortunately, I fired our main
phasers...
... and our direct hit destroyed
the unknown vessel instantly.
I recognize, of course, your voice
has been simulated somehow. I've
already put Data to work on it.
Thank you, Will.
I never made that log entry, of
course. But it still creates a
duty for you to perform.
Yes, sir, I must report it to
Starfleet. But at this distance,
it will take at least a full day
for subspace communications to
reach there...
... and another full day for their
answer to return. I'd like the
truth on this by then.
Sir, you can't believe they'd
relieve you from command...
Why shouldn't they? Better safe
than sorry with the Ferengi now
making friendship overtures.
And it's certain that the Ferengi
are behind this faked log. No
wonder they're still out there,
waiting...
Headache back, sir?
Damn!
I'll call the doctor again.
It's no wonder you have one, with
all this going on, sir.
Try to relax. I've got things in
hand.
Once again...
This is a confession, given by
me, Jean-Luc Picard, commanding
USS Stargazer, in the hopes that
my belated honesty will be taken
into account by Starfleet when
judging...
LaForge, open hailing frequencies.
Open, sir.
I'll take it in the Ready Room.
A secure channel, Geordi.
Secure, Commander.
Starship Ferengi! This is
Commander Riker here. I'd like
to speak to First Officer Kazago.
A problem, Riker?
Is our channel secure on your end?
It is now.
Are you aware of the details of
the Battle of Maxia?
Captain Bok has just made me aware
of it, Riker. The infamy of your
Picard is now fully known.
Infamy?!
I would call the wanton
destruction of an unarmed vessel
infamy.
And if I produce evidence that
Captain Picard's log entry was
falsified to indicate that... ?
What else would your decadent
culture say to defend such
disgrace?! But I can hardly
imagine you contacted me to
discuss an ancient battle.
What do you want of me?
Just one question.
As you humans say, I'm all ears.
First officer to first officer,
Kazago, if your Captain Bok knew
of that, why this peaceful meeting
to present us with the Stargazer?
We freely give YOU back your
derelict warship and now you
accuse US of crime, Riker?!
I can bear NO more insults!
Who the hell is it?!
Not resting, Captain?
More like dying, Doctor. What's
wrong with me?!
I wish to hell I knew, Captain.
But something unusual has
definitely happened to you.
Why do doctors always state the
obvious like it's a revelation?
Why do captains always think
they're immortal?
Better now?
Aghhh! My head!
Now that has to do it right?
No!
You didn't say it's been this bad!
It hasn't been! But it is getting
worse, Doctor...
It has to be some kind of
emotional pressure connected with
the Stargazer...
I got the damn headache before
I even knew my old ship still
existed...
But maybe you're partly right...
Want to talk to Counselor Troi
about it?
What I need now is a friend...
I'm here.
The Stargazer was an exploration
vessel. The fight at Maxia was
not my first action, but it was
the first time I ever killed
anyone.
You had no choice...
Didn't I? I don't know
anymore... I just don't know.
Commander Riker told me about the
altered log, sir. If that's
troubling you...
The last three nights, I... hear
voices. I'm standing on the
bridge, fire all around me... the
klaxons, smoke, and I give the
order...
And now the Stargazer is really
here!
And that log... Am I going crazy?
How do I know if I was in my right
mind at Maxia? How do I know if
I'm in my right mind now?
What was... that?
Just something to let you sleep.
Yes... sleep... I need sl...
... shields weakening, Captain!
Torpedoes armed!
Where are they?
And now, dear captain, you are
ready to live the past!
Where did they... come from?
Phasers, sir? Sir?
SIR?
What should we do, sir?
Should we fire back?
Fire, Captain, FIRE!
You will injure yourself as once
you injured me!
SIR?!
Damage report!
Fusion generator under surge
control, sir!
Power systems failing!
Sensor bearing on hostile ship!
Seven, seven mark nineteen, sir!
Fire in Engineering...
Ready phasers, and lock!
Stand by for warp nine, heading
seven, seven mark twenty...
And ENGAGE!
Steady. NOW reverse and stop!
Phasers FIRE! Torpedoes AWAY!
Fire!
FIRE!!
By comparing the main Stargazer
computer log with Captain Picard's
personal log, I have found
"checksum" discrepancies, sir.
What does that mean?
All information is time-coded by
entry, and the bits when totaled
produce an aggregate amount
which...
I don't want a lesson in computer
science! Bottom line?
One of these two logs is a
forgery.
Correction -- the log just found
aboard the Stargazer is a forgery.
As I said. That is one of them,
isn't it?
You're looking better, Captain.
A little sleep, thanks to the
doctor, works wonders. Any report
on the logs?
Yes, sir. Whoever tampered with
your personal log was clever...
... but slightly clumsy. There's
no doubt it is a fabrication.
Number One, we think you should
see this brain scan graph which...
What are you doing here?!
I thought I was captain of this
starship, Doctor.
Of course you are, but I...
Thank you for your confirmation
of that.
But now, except for Commander
Riker, I want you all back at your
stations...
Is that clear?
I have some business concerning
your health, sir...
I mean you too, Doctor. I have
business with Riker.
Under protest, Captain.
You have orders for me, sir?
Release the Stargazer from the
tractor beam, Number One.
Sir?
The tractor beam.
Sir, are you abandoning...
No. Her inertia will carry the
Stargazer along on this heading
with us. Or did you sleep through
the Academy lecture on conserving
tractor beam power?
No, sir. I'll release her, or
course.
Obviously, there is some thought
process disorder here but I cannot
find any physical reason for it.
Anything?
I'm puzzled too. I keep sensing
random thoughts... but two sets
of them. As if they were his,
but intermixed with his from
another source.
I'm busy at the moment, Wesley...
I know you're busy, Mom, but when
I went back to the main sensors
in Engineering to try some more
sensitivity experiments...
Wes! I'll be glad to hear about
it when I'm through with...
But, Mom, this is important!
Does it have something to do with
Captain Picard?
Yes, ma'am...
... if that's what you're talking
about there. I don't know
anything about brain scans but
I glanced at these when you were
studying them, Mom, and I
noticed...
... these patterns here were like
patterns of the low-intensity
transmissions picked up from the
Ferengi ship.
I just went back and checked and
they're exactly the same.
What kind of transmissions?
I don't know. Engineering has
nothing like it on record.
Let's get to the captain...
No, they might be affecting the
captain. To Riker!
You're welcome, ladies.
Adults!
The captain, Commander?
Resting in his quarters...
... after ordering both of you
to your duty stations.
This is more important!
Than the captain's orders?
Yes, when we have reason to
believe his judgment is being
affected.
Well then, why not let everyone
in on it?
It affects them too. There have
been some strange...
Did he say "low intensity... ?"
... unusual low intensity
transmissions from the Ferengi
vessel...
Did who say?
My son!
... transmissions which exactly
match certain anomalies found in
the captain's brain scans.
Something over there is affecting
Captain Picard's thought patterns.
Computer, tell me Captain Picard's
location!
Captain Picard is in Transporter
Room Three.
What? Computer, emergency order
to Transporter Room Three...
New information. Captain Picard
is no longer aboard the
Enterprise.
Welcome back, Captain.
What is happening?
Shields up, computer.
Shields in place.
What are you doing?
Collecting on an old debt...
AGHHH-H-H!!
Stargazer! Respond, Captain!
Shields up, sir. No way to beam
over help.
I am reading something very
strange. A low intensity beam
of intermittent pulse inside this
starship.
I have a fix on it...
Inside Captain Picard's quarters.
You transferred some of his
belongings from the Stargazer... ?
Including a fairly heavy chest... !
Go take a look, fast!
The Stargazer is powering up!
I have been waiting a long seven
years for this, Picard!
I have no idea what you're talking
about...
Do you not, hu-man? Can you not
remember the crime you committed
against my very blood?
You murdered my only son!
Your son?
He was the commander of the ship
you destroyed!)
On his first voyage as DaiMon.
The ship... ? The... the Ferengi
ship that attacked me...
... or is it about to attack me?
And I have spent these years
searching... seeking... a proper
blood revenge. And I found it!
OHHHHH... ! OHHHHH... !
From a distant world which hu-man
evil has not yet reached. May
you never secure these! I am rich,
yet two of these cost me the
profits of an entire life.
You cannot... control me like...
Die well, Picard.
First officer's log, stardate
41724.3. Captain Picard, without
explanation, has beamed himself
to the Stargazer which is now
moving away from us...
... under its own power.
Hailing frequencies open, sir.
Enterprise to Stargazer, please
respond.
Enterprise to Stargazer... to
Captain Picard aboard Stargazer,
please answer.
Mister Data, what was Stargazer's
condition?
Considerable fire damage to
interior surface as reported, sir.
But none of her main systems are
crippled.
Armaments, Lieutenant Yar?
Six photon torpedoes short, sir,
probably used when the Captain
destroyed his Ferengi attacker
seven years ago. Otherwise fully
armed.
Where in the Captain's quarters
was it, Mister Worf?
His chest from the Stargazer, sir.
Just where I had left it -- he
hadn't yet unpacked.
So, he may not have even known
it was there. And if this is able
to pick up or magnify a
thought-altering transmission...
... it could have prepared him for
whatever's happening now.
Let's find out... or try to.
Contact the Ferengi vessel,
Lieutenant.
Hailing frequencies open, sir.
Enterprise to Ferengi vessel, we
transmit visually. Do you
respond?
Why is our gift to you under
power, hu-man?
I'll discuss that with your
captain.
He is working in our ship's
laboratory. Where is your
captain?
He's beamed himself aboard the
Stargazer, and I'm wondering...
... if this has anything to do with
it?
How do you have possession of
that?
It was found in our captain's
belongings, brought over from the
Stargazer.
It... is a forbidden device. A
Thought Maker. If your captain
is... criminal enough to own one...
Kazago, I ask again, first officer
to first officer... what is going
on? Something is happening that
neither of us seems to know about.
It... is not seemly to question
one's own DaiMon, Riker. I... am
not prepared to do that...
Sir... I have the Stargazer.
Switch now!
Captain Picard, this is the
Enterprise, sir...
Do not attack again! We are on
a peaceful...
He's living a delusion, sir. He's
seeing things we don't...
Give your identity! You force
us to defend ourselves!
Phasers full up! Arm torpedoes!
Why aren't shields at full
power... ?
We've lost him, sir...
When he put the shields up...
Damn, I said...
... put fusion generators on surge
control.
You're moving too slowly. Arm
the torpedoes, man!
Vigo! Get a fire control party
up here!
Shields weakening, Captain!
Weapons report!
Phasers coming to full charge,
sir. Torpedoes armed!
Who are they? Identify them!
They're turning for a third pass
at us, sir!
We can't take another hit,
Captain!
I can now feel anger from our
captain, first officer.
Frustration over whatever he
is re-living...
The Battle of Maxia, sir! That's
all it can be.
Mister Data?
What is that "maneuver" he became
famous for... ?
The Picard Maneuver!
Mister Data, what is the defense
against that?
There is no defense, sir.
Then devise one! Fast!
First Officer Kazago to hu-man
Riker.
Not now, Kazago!
We do not wish to become involved
in what has become clearly a
Federation matter...
Fine, fine, Enterprise out!
But you should also know that
DaiMon Bok no longer commands this
vessel, Riker. His first officer
has confined him for engaging in
this unprofitable adventure.
Good luck, First Officer Riker.
I have computed a possibility,
Commander. Since even deep space
contains trace gases, sir, a
vessel in the Picard maneuver
might seem to disappear, but our
sensors could locate any sudden
compression of those gases...
And use it as an aiming point?
Blast our own captain to bits?
Aim our tractor beam at it, sir!
Seize it! This class starship has
enough power for that.
In our captain's words... make
it so! Set sensors, tractor
beam...
I hope you're right, Data...
No question of it, sir...
Stand by!
Lock on tractor beam!
Ready phasers!
Captain Picard, listen to me!
Is that you, Vigo?
It's Commander Riker, sir!
Captain, hear me! Look around
you, the Ferengi are using a
thought device on you...
Stand by for warp...
Who are you?!
It's Riker, sir. Your Number One.
Look for a silver sphere...
There it is! Destroy it with
your phaser, Captain!
Phaser...
Yes, a sphere... Bok used it...
Destory it!
Phaser... destroy the sphere.
Captain! Are you all right?
Enterprise, lock on. Beam me
home, Riker.
