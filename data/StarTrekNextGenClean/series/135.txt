Captain's log, stardate 42523.7.
We are in route to newly
established Starbase one-seven-three for port
call. Crew rotation is scheduled,
and we will offload experiment
modules.
Hold it, that's my chair. My luck
is always lousy unless I start
on the dealer's left.
That would seem to be rank
superstition.
Bitter experience has taught me
it's a fundamental truth.
The game is five card stud,
nothing's wild.
This game is exceedingly simple.
With only fifty-two cards,
seventeen of which I will see,
and four players there are a
limited number of possible winning
combinations.
There's more to it than just the
cards.
The bets will give an indication
of the relative strengths of each
hand.
Time to pluck a pigeon.
I think I'm in trouble.
I'll raise five.
Too rich for me.
I will raise you three.
Your three and five more.
Is this what is known as the poker
face?
Are you playing or not?
I will fold.
You had nothing.
He bluffed you, Data.
It makes very little sense to bet
when you cannot win.
But I did win. I was gambling
that you wouldn't call.
But how can you tell?
Instinct, Data, instinct.
The game is seven card high/low
with a buy on the last card. And
just to make it interesting the
man with the axe takes all.
My God, if it isn't Phillipa
Louvois, back in uniform.
Don't gloat, Picard. It's almost
more irritating then when you're
being self-righteous.
Unbelievable, after all this time,
and we're picking up the threads
of old fights as if we'd never
been apart.
Ain't love wonderful.
What are you doing out here?
I'm in charge of the Sector
twenty-three JAG office. I'll
be making some good law.
And maybe do a little good along
the way, too. What do you think?
Anything is possible. You
returned to Starfleet.
I had to, it's the most exciting
and worthwhile place to be.
You didn't have to leave.
They forced me out.
No. That was your own damn
stubborn pride.
When I prosecuted you in the
Stargazer court-martial I was
doing my job.
No, you went way beyond doing the
job. You enjoyed it.
Not true! A court-martial is
standard when a ship has been
lost. I had a duty as an officer
in the Judge Advocate General.
Flummery, you've always enjoyed
the adversarial process more than
arriving at the truth.
Well, I hope you've learned a
little wisdom.
Watch it, you're doing it again.
I'm not being self-righteous.
Merely right.
A distinction, I would submit,
without a difference.
Come and sit down.
I can't stay long. I'm meeting
someone for dinner.
But he hasn't arrived yet.
What makes you think it's a man?
Past experience.
Cute. Try to remember that you're
an officer and a gentleman.
You know, I never thought I would
say this, but it is good to see
you again. You're still a damn
sexy man, Picard.
So buy me dinner.
I thought you were meeting
someone?
Once again you're always right,
Jean-Luc.
Admiral.
Captain Louvois. You're
acquainted with Captain Picard?
Yes, we're old... friends.
Captain, good to see you again.
May I present Commander Bruce
Maddox. He has an interesting
proposal for you.
But that can wait until later.
I'm eager to see the Enterprise.
Admiral, Commander Maddox, allow
me to introduce my first officer,
Commander William Riker.
Pleasure, Commander.
How long has it been since we've
seen each other?
You'd just been assigned as an
ensign aboard the old Reliant.
Oh yes, and I seem to remember
a certain young lieutenant who
had harsh words about snap
inspections, and the admirals who
pulled them.
The situation changes when you've
got the admiral's stripes.
There isn't an officer in
Starfleet who wouldn't give his
right leg to be where you are -- Captain
of the Starship
Enterprise. I'm no different.
I just have the power to get
aboard.
Happy to have you, Admiral.
Bridge. Congratulations on your
appointment. Command of a
Starbase.
Thank you, but I miss a ship.
A bit of advice, Captain. Don't
ever become an admiral. They make
you an administrator.
Admiral on the bridge.
I was a little surprised at the
decision to put a base in force
this close to the Neutral Zone.
As you know, we've had disturbing
news from both sides of the zone.
We're here to respond as needed.
And it won't hurt to have the
Romulans know we're nearby.
Well, Captain, I thank you for
this opportunity. For five
hundred years ships who've borne
the name Enterprise have been a
legend. This one is no different.
Admiral.
Oh yes, Captain. Commander Maddox
is here to do some work on your
android. Please take care of him.
Lieutenant Worf.
How have you been, Data?
My condition does not alter with
the passage of time, Commander.
The two of you are acquainted?
Yes, I evaluated Data when it
first applied to the Academy.
And were the sole member of the
committee to oppose my entrance
on the grounds that I was not a
sentient being.
What exactly will this work
entail?
I'm going to disassemble Data.
I think we will remove this
discussion to the lounge.
Explain this procedure.
Ever since I first saw Data at
its entrance evaluation at
Starfleet Academy, I've wanted
to understand it. I became a
student of the works of Doctor
Noonien Soong -- Data's creator.
I've tried to continue his work,
and I believe I am very close to
the breakthrough which will enable
me to duplicate Soong's work and
replicate this.
But as a first step I must
disassemble and study it. Data
is going to be my guide.
Data?
It sounds intriguing.
How will you proceed?
I'll run a full diagnostic on
Data, evaluating the condition
of its software. I'll then dump
its core memory into the starbase
mainframe computer and begin a
detailed analysis of its
construction.
You have constructed a positronic
brain?
Yes.
Have you determined how the
electron resistance across the
neural filaments is to be
resolved?
Not precisely.
That would seem to be a necessary
first step.
I'm confident that I'll have the
answer once I've examine the
filament links in your anterior
cortex.
But if the answer is not
forthcoming, your model will not
function.
I don't anticipate a problem.
You seem a little vague on the
specifics. What are the risks
to Commander Data?
Negligible.
His basic research lacks the
specifics necessary to support
an experiment of this magnitude.
Data is a valued member of my
bridge crew. Based on what I've
heard I cannot allow him to submit
to your experiment.
I thought this might be your
attitude, Captain.
Here are Starfleet's transfer
orders separating Commander Data
from the Enterprise, and
reassigning it to Starbase one-seven-three
under my command. Data, I'll
expect you in my office at nine
hundred hours tomorrow.
Look, it's a transfer, like any
other transfer.
No, it's not. This is one of my
key officers, and he's been
removed without consulting me.
I'm sorry about that, but
Commander Maddox's work in
robotics is considered critical
by Starfleet Command. Think
what's at stake here. If
Commander Maddox can succeed in
duplicating Noonien Soong's work
other captains on other ships
would have the advantage you now
enjoy: a Data on every bridge.
You don't want Data transferred,
fine. There's an easy solution.
Have him work with Commander
Maddox. Nakamura out.
Come.
You sent for me, sir?
Please, sit down. We've got a
problem.
I find myself in agreement with
that assessment of the situation,
sir.
Your service to this ship has been
exemplary. I don't want to lose
you.
I am pleased to hear you say so.
Thank you.
There is a solution which presents
itself.
Yes, sir?
Undergo the procedure, then the
transfer order becomes moot.
I will not submit to this
procedure.
Data, I understand your objections
to this procedure, but I also have
to consider Starfleet's interests.
If Commander Maddox is correct
there is a possibility that many
more beings such as yourself could
be constructed.
True, but possibility is a word
which can encompass any number
of outcomes -- good and bad.
But if he's right, Starfleet would
be immeasurably enriched.
Captain, I am a Starfleet
officer. Can they force me to
do this?
It's precisely because you are
a Starfleet officer that they can.
We take an oath to serve. In this
case this is the form your service
is taking.
Sir, Lieutenant LaForge's eyes
are far superior to human
biological eyes, true?
Yes.
Then why are not all human
officers required to have their
eyes replaced with cybernetic
implants?
I see. It is precisely because
I am not human.
That will be all, Mister Data.
Computer. Pull all relevant
Starfleet regulations concerning
officer transfers.
Working.
My God, twice in as many days.
I need your help.
An historic moment.
I've been trying to make heads
or tails of this gibberish, and
it's finally defeated me. My
android officer has been
transferred so he can undergo a
highly dangerous procedure. I
want to stop it.
He can refuse to undergo this
procedure, but we can't stop the
transfer.
Once Maddox has Data under his
control anything could happen.
I don't trust that man.
We agree to certain risks when
we join Starfleet.
Acceptable risks, justified risks,
yes, but I can't accept this.
It's unfair and unjust. What
about his rights...
All this passion over a machine.
Don't start. Is there an option?
There's always an option. He can
resign.
So you came to me for help.
Yes, I came to you. You're the
JAG officer in this sector. I had
to come to you.
Wait! I didn't mean it that way.
I'm... I'm glad that you thought
you could... well, come to me.
Trust is too painful a word.
I wish things were different for
us.
"When in disgrace with fortune
I all alone beweep my outcast
Is it just words to you, or do
you fathom the meaning?
It is customary to request
permission before entering an
individual's quarters.
I thought we could talk this out,
that I could try to reassure you.
Your memories and knowledge will
remain intact.
Reduced to mere sterile facts
of the events. The substance,
the flavor of the moment could
be lost. Take games of chance...
Games of chance?
Yes, I had read and absorbed every
treatise and textbook upon the
subject, and felt myself tolerably
well prepared for the experience.
Yet, when I finally played poker,
I discovered that the reality bore
little resemblance to the rules.
The point being?
That while I believe that you can
download the information contained
in the positronic brain, I do not
think you have acquired the
expertise necessary to preserve
the heart of those experiences.
There is an ineffable quality to
memory that I do not believe can
survive the shutdown of my core.
Ineffable quality. I would
rather that we had done this
together, but one way or the other
we are doing it. You're under
my command.
No, sir, I am not under your nor
anyone else's command. I have
resigned from Starfleet.
Resigned. You can't.
I regret the decision, but I must.
I am the culmination of one man's
dream. This is not ego or vanity,
but when Doctor Soong created me
he added to the substance of the
universe. If by your experiments
I am destroyed, something unique
and wonderful will be lost. I
cannot permit that, I must protect
the dream.
And so must I. Keep packing,
you will be reporting.
Captain's log, supplemental.
Commander Bruce Maddox, having
been thwarted by Data's abrupt
resignation from Starfleet is now
seeking a legal remedy for his
woes. Captain Louvois has
requested my presence at those
discussions.
Your response is emotional and
irrational. You're endowing Data
with human characteristics because
it looks human. But it's not.
If it were a box on wheels I
wouldn't be facing this
opposition.
Overt sentimentalism is not one
of Captain Picard's failings.
Trust me, I know.
Data is a valued member of my
crew, an outstanding bridge
officer, a --
If I'm permitted to make this
experiment the horizons for human
achievement become boundless.
Consider, every ship in the
Federation with a Data on board.
Utilizing their tremendous
capabilities. Acting as our hands
and eyes in dangerous situations.
That is worth a little
inconvenience.
Look, you're preaching to the
choir here.
So why don't you get to the point?
Data must not be permitted to
resign.
He's an officer in Starfleet.
He has certain rights...
Rights! Rights! I'm sick to
death of hearing about rights!
What about my right not to have
my life work subverted by blind
ignorance?
We have rule of law in this
Federation. You can't simply
seize people, and experiment with
them to prove your pet theories.
Now you're doing it. Data is an
extraordinary piece of
engineering, but it is a machine.
If you permit it to resign it will
destroy years of work in robotics.
Starfleet doesn't have to allow
the resignation --
Starfleet is not an organization
that ignores its own regulations
when they become inconvenient.
Whether you like it or not, Data
does... have... rights.
Let me put it another way. Would
you permit the computer on the
Enterprise to refuse a refit?
An interesting point, but the
Enterprise computer is property.
Is Data?
Of course.
There might be law to support that
position.
A decision with such broad-ranging
implications must be supported
by an official ruling.
And I trust you will apply the
same zeal to your research that
you used during the Stargazer
court-martial.
You're supposed to rip the
wrapping off a present.
But with the application of a
little care, Wes, the paper can
be utilized again.
You're missing the point.
The Dream of the Fire, by K'Ratak.
Thank you, Worf.
It was in the hands of the
Klingons that the novel attained
its full stature.
I couldn't disagree more, but
we'll save that argument for
another day. Now listen
carefully. I didn't get you a
present --
That is quite all right. None
was expected...
Instead I'm going to give you
something far more valuable -- my
advice. You've spent years
in the womb of Starfleet. Now
you're about to start a new life.
You'd be wise to consider the
experiences offered by
groundside living.
Thank you. I will take that under
advisement.
Excuse me, please.
Is something wrong?
Of course there is. You're going
away.
No one regrets the necessity more
than I, but you do understand my
reasons?
Oh yeah, I understand. I just
don't like your being forced out.
It's not fair.
Doctor Pulaski would, at this
juncture, no doubt remind us that
life is rarely fair.
Sorry, but that doesn't make it
any easier.
I shall... miss you.
Me too.
You take care, Data.
Deanna... does Data have...
do you feel anything from him?
I can't sense anything from Data.
But that proves nothing. There
are many minds from which I can
read no meaning.
There's got to be more to him than
software, nets and chips.
It is possible that Commander
Maddox is correct and we are
anthropomorphizing Data.
Assigning to him emotions and
responses which he may not have.
I'm not sure I see that as a
problem.
A little farewell celebration?
Yes, to which I don't recall
inviting you.
I couldn't miss this. I can't
wait to hear Data's plans.
They are currently somewhat
indefinite, but my programming
offers a number of alternatives.
I am considering teaching. I have
had some success with my star
pupil.
I have a better idea. Carnival
work. They could bill you as the
walking encyclopedia. Ask him
any question --
Number One, Captain Louvois has
called. We're expected in her
office. Meet me in Transporter
Room Five.
On my way.
I know you're just leaving. I'll
escort you.
I have completed my research,
and based on the Acts of Gould
passed in the early twenty-first
century, Data is the property of
Starfleet. He cannot resign and
he cannot refuse to cooperate with
Commander Maddox.
And if I challenge this ruling?
I will be required to hold a
hearing.
Then I so challenge. Convene your
hearing.
Captain, that would be exceedingly
difficult. This is a new base.
I have no staff --
Surely there are regulations to
cover this eventuality.
There are. I can use serving
officers as legal counsel. You
as senior officer would defend.
Very well.
And who gets the unenviable task
of prosecuting this case?
You do. The next most senior
officer aboard defendant's ship.
I can't. I won't. Data's my
friend, my comrade. We've served
together and I not only respect
him, I have affection for him.
This isn't about friendship. This
is about duty, and how we search
for truth.
A system that pits people against
each other can't be the answer.
When people of good conscience
have an honest dispute we
sometimes must resort to this kind
of adversarial system.
You want me to try and prove that
Data's a mere machine. I can't.
I don't believe it. I know he's
more than that. I'm neither
qualified nor willing to do this.
You're going to have to find
someone else.
Then I'll rule summarily based
upon my findings. Data's a
toaster. Have him report to
Commander Maddox immediately for
experimental refit.
I see I have no choice but to
agree.
Good. But you better do your duty
in that courtroom. If I think
for one minute that you're not
giving me your best effort I'll
end this right then and there.
You don't have to remind us of
our duty. Just remember yours.
I've never forgotten it. Not
then, and certainly not now.
Captain Louvois has issued a
ruling that you are the property
of Starfleet Command. You can't
resign.
I see... from limitless options
I am reduced to none, or rather
one. I can only hope that
Commander Maddox is more capable
than it would appear.
No, you're not going to submit.
We're going to fight this.
Captain Louvois may be overly
attached to the letter of the law,
but she has not forgotten its
spirit. She's convening a hearing
and we are going to lay the
question of your legal status to
rest once and for all.
I have been asked to represent
you, but if there is some other
officer with whom you would feel
more comfortable --
Captain, I have complete
confidence in your ability to
represent my interests.
Care to try your hand, Number
One?
Another time. It's too close to
our real contest.
This isn't about you and me.
Isn't it? Data may be the issue,
but our performances are what will
be judged.
That's the nature of the
adversarial process.
Which can only work when the
opponents are of equal ability.
Are you suggesting that we are
not evenly matched?
No, but for Data's sake it has
to be said. I've been forced into
this, and I have only one option.
To give this my best effort.
I see.
Then... you are here...
to warn me...
that you are going to do...
Everything within your power and
within the boundaries of the
law...
to win!
Yes.
So am I.
All right, I'm going to need to
know everything about you.
Sir, all of that information is
stored in the Enterprise computer
banks.
I want to hear it from you.
Very good, sir. Activation
occurred twenty-seven years ago
on Omicron Theta. I entered the
Academy in '44, and graduated in
'48 with honors in probability
mechanics and exobiology. First
posting...
Data, Data, Data, whoa, stop.
I could get this from the
computer.
I believe I indicated that
earlier, sir.
I need to know how you think,
what you want, how you feel. What
drives you, motivates you.
Drives? Motivates? Sir, may I
inquire as to the purpose of this
line of questioning?
We have to prove that you're a
sentient life-form.
But I am not. I am a machine.
That's not what I need to hear.
How can we deny the obvious?
We're searching for an argument
which will legally deny that
obvious fact.
But if it is a fact how can
argument alter --
Data!
Sir?
Stop babbling.
The law recognizes many things
as people that aren't possessed
of flesh and blood. It's a little
legal fiction, you see.
I am beginning to understand why

All rise.
Be seated. Counselors, are you
ready?
We are, your honor.
This hearing convened on stardate
42524.1 is to determine the legal
status of the android known as
Data. The office of the Judge
Advocate General has rendered a
finding of property, defense has
challenged. Commander Riker.
Your honor, there is only one
issue in this case and one
relevant piece of evidence. I
call Lieutenant Commander Data.
Verify, Lieutenant Commander Data.
Current assignment, USS
Enterprise. Starfleet Command
Decoration for...
Your honor, we'll stipulate to
all of this.
Objection, your honor, I want it
read. All of it.
Sustained.
... Gallantry, Medal of Honor with
clusters, Legion of Honor, the
Star Cross.
Commander Data, what are you?
An android.
Which is?
Webster's Twenty-Third Century
Dictionary, Fifth Edition, defines
Android as an automaton made to
resemble a human being.
An automaton. Made. Made by
whom?
Sir?
Who built you, Data?
Doctor Noonien Soong.
And he was?
The foremost authority in
cybernetics.
More basic than that. What was
he?
A human?
Thank you. Data, what is the
capacity of your memory, and how
fast can you process information?
I have an ultimate storage
capacity of eight hundred
quadrillion bits. My total linear
computational speed has been rated
at sixty trillion operations per
second.
Your honor, I offer into evidence
prosecution's exhibit A. A bar
of plasteel with a tensile
strength of forty kilo-bars.
Commander Data, would you please
bend that.
Objection, your honor. Many races
possess meta-human strength. It's
not relevant to the issue before
this court.
I'm afraid I can't agree, Captain.
Proceed with the demonstration,
Commander Riker.
Drawing on the log record of the
construction of the prototype
android Lore, also constructed
by Noonien Soong, I request that
I be allowed to remove Commander
Data's hand for your inspection.
Objection! What is the point of
all this?
The issue before this court is
whether Data is machine, and by
extension property. I'd say this
is pretty damn relevant.
I'm sorry.
Data is a physical representation
of a dream, an idea conceived of
by the mind of a man. His
purpose? To serve human needs
and interests. He is a collection
of neural nets and heuristic
algorithms. His responses are
dictated by an elaborate software
program written by a man. The
hardware
was built by a man.
And this man has turned him off.
Pinocchio is broken, the strings
are cut.
I request a recess.
Granted.
You should get some sleep.
I've lost, and I'm not even sure
I mind. Data is a machine. But
there is something bothering me.
Something I'm missing. Or is it
just wounded pride that I've lost
and in front of her.
What is it that lies between you?
Ancient history.
Unfortunately the past always
resonates in the present, and
decisions made today reach into
the future.
The Stargazer court-martial. It
should have been a routine
hearing. Yes, I had lost my ship,
but my actions were entirely
justified.
Phillipa was assistant to the
prosecution. She dug up every
obscure case and citation and the
panel hammered at me for three
days. It damn near ended my
career. It did end us. She's
enjoying this situation. She
knows I disapprove of the
adversarial system. Now she's
forced me into active
participation, and she's both
pleased and angered to see me fail.
Emotions. They're such slippery,
contradictory things. It's a
wonder any of us ever crawled out
of the oceans, or swung down out
of the trees.
Well, there's only one thing to
do. I go to her in the morning,
and we discuss a deal.
I had heard a lot about you before
I joined the Enterprise. About
how Picard was a man who never
knew when to lie down and admit
he was beat.
I have to salvage at least some
of Data's rights. If Data agrees
to undergo Commander Maddox's
procedure we can get out of this
hearing before he's declared the
property of Starfleet command.
If Commander Maddox is successful
in disassembling and reassembling
Data, what has he gained?
The ability to build another.
A hundred others, a thousand.
To do what?
Explore for us. Enter the
dangerous situations.
All those future Datas risking
their lives for the people who
created them.
You said something earlier about
decisions today.
Having implications for the
future.
Precedent! This case will set
the precedent for all the future
Datas. It will determine their
status, and they'll all be
property.
There is an ancient word for it -- slavery.
Not a word we want back in our
vocabulary.
Good luck, sir.
Commander Riker has dramatically
demonstrated to this court that
Lieutenant Commander Data is a
machine. Do we deny that? No.
But how is this relevant? We too
are machines, just machines of
a different type. Commander Riker
has continually reminded us that
Data was built by a human. We
do not deny that fact. But again
how is it relevant? Does
construction imply ownership?
Children are created from the
building blocks of their parents'
DNA. Are they property? We have
a chance in this hearing to
severely limit the boundaries
of freedom. And I think we
better be pretty damn careful
before we take so arrogant a step.
I call Lieutenant Commander Data
to the stand.
What are these, please?
My medals.
Why pack them? What logical
purpose do they serve?
I... I do not know, sir. None
I suppose. I just wanted them.
Is that vanity?
And this?
It was a gift from you, sir.
You value it?
Yes, sir.
Why?
It is a reminder of friendship
and service.
And this? You have no portraits
of any other of your crewmates.
Why this person?
I would prefer not to answer that
question, sir. I gave my word.
Mister Data, may I remind you, that
you are under oath.
And under the circumstances, I
don't think Tasha would mind.
She was important to me... we
were... intimate.
I have no further questions of
this witness.
Commander Riker, do you wish to
cross?
I have no questions, your honor.
I call to the stand Commander
Bruce Maddox as a hostile witness.
Verify, Maddox, Bruce, Commander.
Current assignment, Chair of
Robotics, Federation Institute
of Technology. Major papers...
Enough. Suffice it to say, he's
an expert.
Commander Maddox, it is your
contention that Data is not a
sentient being and therefore not
entitled to those rights reserved
for all other life-forms in this
Federation?
Data is not sentient, no.
Why, Commander?
Because Data is a piece of
outstanding engineering and
programming.
What is required for sentience?
Intelligence, self awareness,
consciousness.
Do you know what sentience is,
Commander?
Of course.
Excellent. Then you can enlighten
the rest of us.
Prove to this court that I'm
sentient.
This is absurd!
Why? Because you can't do it?
No, it's just pointless. We all
know you're sentient.
So I'm sentient, but Data isn't?
That's right.
Why?
Well... well, you're self aware.
Ah, the second ingredient. But
let's deal with the first
requirement. Is Data
intelligent?
Yes.
Why?
It has the ability to learn and
understand, and to cope with new
situations.
Like this hearing. What about
self awareness. What does that
mean? Why am I self aware?
Because you are conscious of your
existence and actions. You're
aware of yourself and your own
ego.
Data, what are you doing now?
I am taking part in a legal
hearing to determine my rights
and status. Am I property or
person?
And what's at stake?
My right to choose. Perhaps my
very life.
My rights. My status. My right
to choose. My life. He seems
pretty damn self aware to me.
Well, Commander Maddox, I'm
waiting.
This is exceedingly difficult...
Do you like Data?
I don't know it well enough to
like or dislike it.
But you admire him?
Oh yes, it's an outstanding --
Piece of engineering and
programming. Yes, you've said
that. You've devoted your life
to the study of cybernetics in
general?
Yes.
And Data in particular?
Yes.
And now you're proposing to
dismantle him.
So I can rebuild him and construct
more!
How many more?
Hundreds, thousands. There's no
limit.
And do what with them?
Use them.
How?
As effective units on Federation
ships. As replacements for
humans in dangerous situations.
So much is closed to us because
of our fragility. But they...
Are expendable.
It sounds harsh but to some
extent, yes.
Are you expendable, Commander
Maddox? Never mind. A single
Data is a curiosity, a wonder,
but a thousand Datas, doesn't that
become a new race? And aren't
we going to be judged as a species
about how we treat these
creations? If they're expendable,
disposable, aren't we? What is
Data?
What? I don't understand.
What... is... he?
A machine!
Is he? Are you sure?
Yes!
But he's met two of your three
criteria for sentience, and we
haven't addressed the third. So
we might find him meeting your
third criterion, and then what
is he?
I don't know. I don't know!
He doesn't know.
Do you? That's the decision
you're facing. Your honor, a
courtroom is a crucible. In it
we burn away the egos, the selfish
desires, the half-truths, until
we're left with the pure product
-- a truth -- for all time.
Sooner or later it's going to
happen. This man or others like
him are going to succeed in
replicating Data. And then we
have to decide -- what are they?
And how will we treat these
creations of our genius? The
decision you reach here today
stretches far beyond this android
and this courtroom. It will
reveal the kind of a people we
are. And what
... they are going to be. Do you
condemn then to slavery?
Starfleet was founded to seek out
new life.
Well, there he sits, your honor,
waiting on our decision. You have
a chance to make law. Well, let's
make a good one. Let us be wise.
This case touches on metaphysics,
and that's the province of
philosophers and poets. Not
confused jurists who don't have
the answers. But sometimes we
have to make a stab in the dark,
and speak to the future. Is Data
a machine? Absolutely. Is he
our property? No... (this will
be rewritten with additions).
You see, sometimes it works.
Continue your work, Commander,
and when you are ready I will
still be here.
You'd be willing after what I've
put you through?
Yes, it would be a less lonely
universe if there were more of
my kind.
He's remarkable.
You didn't call him "it."
Sir, there is a celebration on
the Holodeck.
I have no right to be there.
Because you failed in your task?
No, God, no. Data, I came this
close to winning.
Yes, sir.
I could have cost you your life!
Yes, that is true, but
Commander... Will, I have learned
from your experience.
What could you have possibly
learned from this kind of ordeal?
That at times one must deny their
nature, sacrifice their own
personal beliefs to protect
another. Is it not true that had
you refused to prosecute, Captain
Louvois would have ruled summarily
against me?
Yes.
That action injured you, and saved
me. I will not forget.
You're a wise man, my friend.
Not yet sir, but with your help
I am learning.
