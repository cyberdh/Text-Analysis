Doctor Beverly Crusher, Personal
Log, Stardate 44821.3. Began
an analysis today of the
respiratory problems being
experienced by the populations on
the two moons of Peliar Zel.
Finally got an actual letter from
Wesley... topped the class in
exo-biology, but he's still
struggling in Ancient
Philosophies.
And... there's... a new man in
my life.
Ambassador Odan... Doctor
Crusher... I was just on my way
to see you.
Hello, Data...
I have completed my study of the
atmospheric variations which have
occurred on the moons since the
new technology was implemented.
Thank you, Commander. That will
be most helpful in my efforts to
mediate the quarrel.
I could go over them with you now.
It would not require more than
two hours.
We do appreciate it, Data... but
the Ambassador and I have set
aside this time... to analyze
the incidence of lung disease
among the moons' inhabitants.
Then it is perfect timing, Doctor
-- what better occasion to
integrate my results into your
study?
Now that I think about it,
Commander... you're absolutely
right. Unfortunately, I'm not
feeling well... perhaps Doctor
Crusher could get you started,
inputting your information... but
I must I return to my quarters.
Ambassador, are you still having
those awful headaches?
I'll bring you a hypospray to take
care of it...
I would be most grateful...
Put a cold cloth on your forehead
and lie down, Ambassador. I'll
be with you shortly.
I'll set you up at the medical
monitor, Data... it'll take you
a while to input the figures,
won't it?
At least an hour... but I do not
believe much time can be saved
from that estimate by exhibiting
such haste now...
Data... there are times... when
every second does count.
Somehow, I had an unnatural fear
that Data was going to barge in
and ask to discuss the peripheral
effects of magnetospheric energy
taps.
If I don't get back and look at
his projections, he might come
looking for me.
When I first met the formidable
Doctor Beverly... I thought to
myself... "This woman is ice...
through to her bones... "
Who would have dreamed... that
instead of ice, there is fire...
I can't believe this has
happened... in just a week...
Stay here... don't go...
Odan... are we... is this...
interfering? With your work on
the Peliar Zel problems?
Fortunately I've done about as
much as I can until we get there.
Because I wouldn't be able to
keep my mind on work now...
Odan... I have to get back...
Promise me we'll be together
tonight...
I promise...
Then go, Doctor Beverly...
It's just Beverly...
Not just Beverly. It's Beverly's
smile and her kindness, her
beauty, within and without. So
much more than just Beverly...
Picard to Ambassador Odan...
Yes, Captain? This is Odan...
The Federation representative from
Peliar Zel has come on board.
Could you meet us in the
Observation Lounge?
I'll be right there, Captain.
And Ambassador... if you should
run into Doctor Crusher, would
you ask her to join us as well?
By all means. If I run into her.
Where've you been?
With a patient. Minor emergency.
Ambassador Odan, this is Governor
Leka Trion, of Peliar Zel.
Ambassador... thank you for
coming.
I knew your father.
His efforts helped keep our
people at peace for several
generations.
I would hope to serve you as well
as he.
I hope Doctor Crusher was able
to help you with your headache.
Thank you. Actually, she was.
Governor Leka has intercepted us
before we reached her planet in
order to update us on the
situation.
It has grown progressively worse.
The people on our moons have been
in discord ever since they
migrated from the planet five
centuries ago. For us on the
planet... it is like having two
squabbling children. We try to
help settle their arguments
without taking sides... but this
time, we are at a loss.
I've been studying the information
you sent... If I understand
correctly, the people of Alpha
moon have found a way to tap
directly into the magnetic field
of your planet, and now rely
exclusively on that energy
source.
Yes. But the Beta moon seems to
be suffering some environmental
damage as a result.
My design models suggest that Beta
will begin to experience rising
temperatures... erratic tide
surges... and in general the
beginnings of global warming.
The impact on the health of the
Betan people is clear. There
will be profound medical
repercussions.
Alpha is unwilling to lose their
new-found energy source... Beta
accuses them of intentionally
courting genocide... our efforts
to find a compromise have failed.
And now --
-- we've received intelligence
that both sides are arming for
war. If that happens... the
people of my planet will begin
to take sides... the outcome can
only be disastrous.
We will be in orbit around Peliar
Zel within six hours. If you can
arrange for the representatives
of Alpha and Beta to be there,
Ambassador Odan can beam directly
to the planet.
Excuse me, Captain... I would
prefer to shuttle to the surface.
I would not recommend it. There
are many radical factions involved
in this dispute. It would be
difficult to guarantee your
safety.
I'm sure I'm not the first who
has expressed discomfort with the
idea of molecular transport.
Thank you, but I much prefer to
keep myself intact. I'll shuttle
down.
As you like.
Counselor... ?
It's Ambassador Odan... I continue
to feel such... fluctuations...
of emotion from him.
Maybe it's just spring, Deanna...
Or perhaps these sensations are
perfectly normal among the Trill.
It could be... we know so little
about them...
But he seems a lovely person...
very much a gentleman, don't you
think?
Yes. Quite.
Is that the colgonite astringent
you have on your eyes? I've never
tried it...
Yes... I mean, I guess it is...
someone just put it on me...
I never knew you even came in
here...
I don't. I mean, not usually...
But sometimes it feels good just
to indulge yourself...
I guess so...
Especially when you haven't done
so for a while...
What's that supposed to mean?
Beverly... you're in love.
How... how did you know?
I don't really think it's much
of a secret.
It isn't?
No. You've been -- glowing.
"Glowing... " Well, yeah... that's
just how I feel, Deanna...
What... ?
Nothing --
Yes, there is, I can tell. What
is it?
Just... something I sense in Odan.
What? What do you sense?
I'm not sure how to describe it...
and I'm not saying there's
anything wrong, it's just...
Beverly... how well do you really
know him?
I... I feel like I know him better
than anyone I've ever known...
but...
Am I being foolish? I don't think
so... and yet... it's only been
a couple of weeks... Of course,
maybe that means it's just
infatuation... but I'm a grown
up, I know the difference between
love and infatuation...
But one thing I'm sure of... is
that I haven't felt like this in
a long time...
And you like it...
I like it.
Come.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Ambassador. We've entered
orbit... the shuttle will
transport you to the surface in
a few minutes.
I am ready, Captain.
How will you proceed once you're
there?
I cannot answer that. I never
know until I am into the
situation... meet the people
involved. I work very much by
instinct, not by pre-arranged
plan.
It seems to work well for you.
I do like to go into a situation
as well informed as possible...
and your staff has been quite
helpful in briefing me on the
problems involved here.
Particularly Doctor Crusher.
My staff is quite capable. I'm
glad they've been useful.
Your Doctor Beverly is an
extraordinary person... both as
a scientist... and as a woman.
I'm sure that's true. Well...
shall we make our way to the
Shuttlebay?
Captain... you know her better
than I... do you have any idea
how -- committed -- she is to
remaining with Starfleet?
I wouldn't presume to speak for
her.
Of course not. I just thought...
you've known her for so long...
Ensign Taggert to Captain
Picard...
Yes, Ensign?
The shuttle is ready to transport
the Ambassador.
Very well.
I can find my own way, Captain.
I hope to bring good news when
I return.
Commander Riker asked to pilot
you himself, Ambassador.
I am honored.
I don't know when I'll be back...
I know... have a safe trip.
I will stay safe, Doctor
Beverly... I have good reason
to return...
I have researched earth customs.
This flower is given to express
love.
Yes, it is...
Initiate shuttle pre-flight
sequence.
Pre-flight under way...
counting to clearance...
Shuttle has cleared the Bay door.
Commander Riker, you will be out
of shield range in five seconds.
Acknowledged, Lieutenant. We'll
be entering the upper ionosphere
in two minutes, twenty seconds.
Captain... an unidentified ship
is emerging from the limb of the
moon.
Hail the vessel.
I have visual contact. I don't
recognize it.
Sir, it claims to be an escort
vessel from the Beta moon.
There was no mention of an
escort... request a security
clearance code.
They do not answer, sir.
Commander, stand by to return to
the Shuttlebay.
Captain -- the escort ship is
loading its phaser banks!
Increasing power to the shields...
coming about...
Engage tractor beam. Number One
-- report.
We've lost the port thruster and
both back-up stabilizers... I'm
losing control...
We're bringing you in.
Captain, the shuttle hull has been
weakened. We're breaking up...
you can't tow us. Better beam
us directly on board...
No... don't do it...
I can't stabilize the shuttle...
If you transport me, it will kill
me... please...
Number One... we're ready to beam
you aboard.
Belay that, Captain. I'm going
to bring her in manually.
Advise Doctor Crusher we have a
medical emergency.
He's in shock... he's lost a lot
of blood... but that doesn't
account for these readings...
Eosinophilia in the cerebrospinal
fluid at forty-six percent.
Sedimentation rate is
twenty-nine... but his lymphocytes
are intact...
It's as though there's a parasite
at work...
Odan... I have to do exploratory
surgery. You may have a parasitic
infection...
You must not.
But... you won't survive...
What is that... ?
Beverly... that... is me...
What... ?
This body... is just a host. I
am that parasite... and that is
what must survive.
It has always been this way...
the Trill are a joined species...
a host and a symbiont... and in
this fashion we have survived for
millenia...
You're dying... what can I do?
The host body is dying... You must
contact the Trill quickly... tell
them I need another host. They
will send a replacement.
I know it is hard to accept...
but I beg you, Doctor Beverly...
help me... this mission must be
completed.
Odan's host body died of the
injuries just over an hour ago.
But the symbiont being...
Odan... is still alive.
Odan is the one who negotiated
the last treaty. The man everyone
thought was his father was just
another host body.
And the reason Odan refused the
transporter...
It would have damaged the
symbiont.
We have contacted the Trill.
Another host will arrive within
forty hours.
I've placed Odan in stasis.
He can survive for an hour...
maybe two... but not beyond that.
Is it possible I could serve as
a temporary carrier?
No, Data. The relationship
requires a biological being.
We are at a desperate impasse with
the situation in the Peliar
system. The attack on our
shuttlecraft has inflamed the
dispute.
Who was responsible, Captain?
No one will admit anything. Each
side accuses the other and threats
are mounting. We need Odan...
Doctor... could a human host carry
him?
I... believe so. From Odan's
description of the process... it
should be possible. But --
Then I volunteer.
There's been no precedent for a
human host. I couldn't guarantee
what... what might happen.
Would you be able to remove the
symbiont when the new host
arrives?
In theory, yes. I just don't know
what might happen to a human body
in the process.
Commander... the risk is too
great.
Weigh it against the prospect
of war.
It is your choice, Will.
Then let's get to it.
I've given you a local
anesthetic... but you must be
conscious while the implantation
takes place. Drugs might damage
the symbiont.
I understand.
Laser scalpel.
How are you feeling? Is there
pain?
No... just... strange
sensations...
Vital signs?
Heart rate one hundred ten...
blood pressure ninety over
forty...
I can't close yet... the
assimilation isn't complete...
Pulse one thirty... and
climbing... E.E.G. erratic.
He's going to start fibrillating.
Two hundred milligrams
metrazene...
Will... hang on...
I'm closing...
No change...
The metrazene should have
stabilized him... I'll give it
ten seconds more before we go
in again.
Blood pressure leveling off...
I think he's stabilizing.
That's better... signs are
returning to normal.
Will... it's Beverly. Can you
hear me?
Hello...
You're going to be all right.
How do you feel?
I am just fine... but you look
tired, Doctor Beverly.
I realize it will be disturbing,
Governor... but you must convince
the inhabitants of the moons that
I am Odan... I have his thoughts,
his memories, his skills...
They will perceive you as a
Starfleet officer... perhaps with
your own agenda...
The man they knew as my father...
the man who stands before them
now... both are merely hosts.
It is your task to help them
understand.
I will try. I cannot promise they
will listen. They are more
factionalized than ever, and
listening is a skill which seems
to have evaporated in the heat
of argument.
Speak softly, Governor. People
who cannot hear an angry shout...
will often strain to hear a
whisper.
I will do what I can.
Well done.
Sorry... a little dizzy...
Mister Worf, take the Ambassador
to his quarters.
I'll be all right... just need
to lie down a minute...
Bridge to Crusher...
Yes, Captain?
The Ambassador is not well.
Please see to him in his quarters.
Right away, sir.
I'm getting a slightly elevated
white cell count... six-tenths
of a degree of temperature...
... nothing that indicates
rejection.
That's good...
But you look awfully pale...
Just a little weak...
light-headed...
Cerebral blood flow looks
normal...
I'll leave you a metabolic
booster... use it if the symptoms
get worse...
Beverly...
Beyond that, I don't know what
to do.
This is... all new for me.
For me as well.
Please don't go... we need to talk
about this...
I... don't know what to say...
where to begin...
Nor do I... but I know that
silence will injure us...
Maybe you should have thought
about that sooner. Maybe you
should have told me what you were.
It didn't bother you to stay
silent yesterday...
But... it never occurred to me.
This is what I am... did you tell
me you are only a single being?
Of course not... it is normal
for you...
I don't know how to handle this...
I just... don't know who you
are...
I understand... but whoever I seem
to be... I am Odan... the man who
loved you... and that has not
changed. I still love you. I
can't help that.
But if that causes you pain...
I will suppress it. I will keep
my distance, Doctor Beverly. I
would never hurt you.
Five card draw. Ante up.
Commander -- come on in...
Geordi... I believe the correct
term now would be "Ambassador."
You can call me anything you like.
I know this must be difficult for
you.
May I join you?
Sure! Sit down... right here...
We are pleased you're here.
Are you familiar with this game,
Ambassador?
No.
But... I seem to have done this
before...
Ambassador, what is the precise
nature of the symbiotic joining?
Are you Odan? Or Commander Riker?
Or a combination of both?
I wish I could give you an answer
as simple as the question.
Ordinarily, the host body has no
personality. This time... is
different somehow.
I've never done this... and yet
I know how.
And something compelled me to come
here tonight... though I didn't
consciously know what would await
me. It is as though... Will Riker
is here with me... I have never
felt that with other hosts.
I guess the question is... will
the Commander be alright... when
he comes back?
Gentlemen... I am making you
uncomfortable. Please... continue
without me.
May I join you?
The first man I ever loved
unconditionally... was named
Stefan.
He was a soccer player... I would
watch him race down the field and
I thought my heart would stop
because he was so beautiful...
We married and had three
children... twin boys, Andrew and
Alex, and then a girl, Jennifer...
Stefan became a famous artist and
created huge, breathtaking metal
sculptures... I kept house and
made the world easy for him...
and he came to adore me as much
as I worshipped him...
At least in my daydreams. Stefan
was eleven... and I was eight.
He never even knew I existed.
Deanna... I loved Odan. I'm sure
of that... I had no doubts, no
fears...
... and now... I don't know what
it was I loved. His eyes... his
hands, his mouth... his body?
They're gone. If that was all
it was, I should mourn him and
go on...
But there was so much more... I
felt completely free with him...
unguarded... at ease with
myself... There were so many
things that made him special to
me. Where are they? Are they
still here... alive in Will Riker?
I look at Will and I see someone
I've known for years... a kind of
brother. But... inside... is it
really Odan... ?
Help me, Deanna... please...
What... what do your feelings tell
you?
I feel the pull... it's
powerful...
I wish he'd never come on this
ship... I was happy tending
patients and doing my research...
Don't wish that, Beverly... you
can never be open to love if you
won't risk pain...
I don't care... I'd give anything
not to feel the way I do now...
there's no happiness that's worth
this...
He's here. He just walked in.
Look at him.
I don't want to look at him...
Talk to me Deanna, please... keep
talking.
The first man I ever loved... was
my father. He was strong and
tall... he carried me when the
ground was muddy... he chased away
the monsters who hid under my bed
at night... he sang to me and he
kept me safe. And then he went
away.
What I wouldn't give to hear his
songs again... to feel his arms
protect me. I never will. But
I can still feel his warmth, his
love... as though he were here
with me.
Beverly, if you can feel those
things from the man we know as
Will Riker, accept them, accept
the love.
Captain's Log, Stardate 44823.8.
Representative of the moons of
Peliar Zel have agreed to come
on board to meet the new
Ambassador Odan.
White count is elevated... it's
higher every time I read it...
Are you in pain?
Not much...
Ambassador... I can stall the
representatives...
No. They would consider it
deception. I must meet them.
Surely... to present yourself in
this condition... will not help
our cause.
I promise you, Captain... they
will not know I am ill.
Captain... the emissaries.
May I present Kalin Trose, of
Alpha moon... and Lathal Bine,
of Beta moon.
Thank you for receiving us,
Captain.
Is this Ambassador Odan?
Lathal Bine... It was your aunt
who represented Beta thirty years
ago...
That is correct.
A formidable woman. I had the
utmost respect for her.
And who was it who spoke for
Alpha... so long ago... ?
It was you, of course, Kalin
Trose. Then you were a young man,
bristling with passion and zeal...
But wise enough to see that your
people needed peace to ensure
their future...
And... how did you manage to
achieve a compromise... between
that young man and the iron-willed
woman of Beta moon?
They agreed to trade places for
a week... understand each other's
situation with more informed
eyes... after that -- an agreement
came swiftly.
Nothing you have said is beyond
what a school child could learn
from a history book.
But it's not commonly known...
that during those negotiations...
Kalin Trose, you quelled a plot
by radicals on your moon to
assasinate the Beta delegation.
It... is true.
Perhaps he was wiser in his youth
than he is now. Odan -- you must
convince him to stop --
Do you accept me? Will you allow
me to work with you?
Yes. The people of Beta moon
accept you.
And Alpha moon?
I will consider it. But I must
consult others.
This is a typical tactic... he
is an obstructionist, you can see
that --
Kalin Trose, you may confer with
your people. But we must have
your answer within eight hours.
You shall have it.
Beverly... help me...
All his vital functions are
overworked. His immune system
is under attack. I can only guess
that he's going through classic
rejection syndrome.
Is there any treatment you can
give him?
I can administer an
immunosuppressant. It would help
with the symptoms... but it
wouldn't correct the underlying
cause. He's carrying a foreign
organism in his body.
I don't know what to do... medical
school didn't exactly prepare me
for a situation like this...
You're doing all you can...
Thank you. I wish that were more
comforting.
Don't worry about me, Captain.
I'm fine.
Ambassador... when you feel up
to it, please join me in my Ready
Room.
I'm giving you something that
should help you feel better. At
least temporarily.
The pain is gone... thank you...
Please... don't...
Let me touch you... just for a
moment...
No... please...
It was a fast decision, which we
must take as positive. The Alphan
representative has agreed...
somewhat dubiously... to let you
mediate the dispute.
I was sure they would. They are
reasonable people... just trapped
in their own anger.
I have no doubt, however, that
they will bolt if anything goes
wrong in your discussions.
Then it's up to me to make sure
nothing goes wrong.
Have I said something wrong... ?
No... it's just... for a
moment... you sounded more like
Will Riker.
We have received word that your
new host will arrive in eighteen
hours. Will you be all right
until then?
The medication which Doctor
Beverly gave me has helped. I
will find a way to keep going.
It is an awkward situation for
her. As you can imagine.
Yes. Yes, I certainly can.
And for you as well.
My life has been spent... trying
to help others find solutions to
insoluble problems. And now...
I am confronted with one of my
own for which there is truly no
answer.
Lemon tea...
Computer... location of Doctor
Beverly Crusher.
Doctor Crusher is in her
quarters.
Can you make balso tonic?
There is no formula on record.
Please supply a molecular
structure.
Never mind.
Come in...
I thought... I should see how
you're doing. If you needed
another hypospray...
I don't think so... the symptoms
have not returned...
Ah. Well... that's good.
Yes.
Tomorrow is an important day.
Do you feel -- ready for it?
I think so. I have been
preparing.
That's good.
Yes.
I'll check your vital signs in
the morning... before the
representatives get here.
They must not know I'm taking
medication...
You could arrange to take a series
of breaks...
That's good...
Yes...
Beverly... I want you...
If you are going to leave... you
must go now...
I'm not leaving.
Captain's log, Stardate 44824.4.
The representatives of Peliar Zel
and its two moons are ready to
transport on board. We have
learned that they each have
troops massed and are ready for
combat if this final effort at
peace is not successful.
White count is back up...
temperature elevated... the
effects of the medication are
wearing off faster every time.
I'll administer one now... and
hope it holds for an hour or
two...
No... no more.
Ambassador... it's clear you're
in pain. You can't get through
the next hours without help --
I must.
Are the injections damaging the
host body... Riker's body?
Yes. I cannot put him at further
risk.
But how can you function? Conduct
the meeting?
I'll manage.
We will respect your wishes.
Further... I will conduct the
mediation today... but at the end
of today, regardless of the
outcome... I must be removed from
Riker's body. Even if the new
host has not yet arrived.
But... you wouldn't survive...
Riker will not survive unless I
am removed. He has given
enough...
Odan...
Your word.
Very well.
Worf to Captain Picard...
Yes, Mister Worf?
The representatives have arrived.
I will escort them to the
Observation Lounge.
Thank you.
I'll stand by with the medication,
just in case. The pain may become
so intense --
Beverly...
Whatever else I have been to
you... I am your friend. I cannot
imagine what you are going
through... but it must be a kind
of hell. I want you to know...
I am here... to help you... in
any way I can.
Jean-Luc...
Computer, what time is it?
Fifteen thirty five hours.
They've been in there almost six
hours...
Captain... a message from the ship
carrying the Trill host...
Are they here?
No. They are experiencing
difficulty. They do not
anticipate their arrival for
another nine hours.
Nine hours...
Ambassador...
It was worth it...
They will not go to war...
Mister Worf, make sure the
representatives are safely
transported off the ship.
Ensign, set a course to intercept
the Trill ship. Prepare to go
to warp nine.
Sir, it could take more than two
hours to reach the vessel.
I have no choice... I gave my
word. I have to remove him.
Let's hope we reach the new host
in time.
Will is all right. His vital
signs have stabilized... he's
sleeping now.
And... how is Odan?
I have placed him in stasis. He's
fine for the moment.
You need some rest, Doctor.
No. If Odan is to survive, he
must be implanted in the host as
soon as he arrives. I'll wait
here.
It will be some time yet.
I know.
Doctor...
Is the Trill host here?
Yes.
Thank goodness... bring him in.
Doctor...
I am Kareel. I am to become host
to Odan.
... the operation to implant Odan
into the new host was completed
at nineteen hundred hours and
appears to have been successful.
There have been no difficulties
with assimilation...
Doctor Beverly...
Could we talk for a moment?
You should be sleeping. You need
rest.
I've never felt better.
Except once or twice...
My poor Beverly... this has been
so hard for you...
I want to thank you... for your
caring... for standing by me...
I congratulate you. You averted
a war that would have cost many
lives...
Yes. It seems... everything has
turned out for the best.
And yes... I am still Odan... and
I still love you. I cannot
imagine that ever changing.
I'm glad you're all right.
Is there to be nothing more?
Perhaps it is a human failing...
but we are not accustomed to
these kinds of changes. I
can't... keep up. How long will
you have this host? What
would the next one be? I
couldn't live with that kind of
uncertainty...
Perhaps... someday... our ability
to love will not be so limited.
I understand.
Odan...
I do love you... please remember
that.
I will never forget you.
