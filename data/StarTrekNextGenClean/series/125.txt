First officer's log, stardate
41775.5. We are en route to the
ocean world known as Pacifica...
Our mission is routinely
scientific in nature. We look
forward to seeing the warm blue
waters and fine white beaches that
make Pacifica a treasured jewel
of the galaxy.
... So the guy staggers to his
feet and goes back to the girl.
She smiles, looks him right in
the eye and says "Just try that
in hyperspace!"
Ah, I see. So the difficulty in
attaining such complex
positioning in a zero gravity
environment, coupled with the
adverse effect it would have on
the psychological well being of
the average human male, is what
makes this anecdote so amusing.
Yes. Very humorous indeed.
Hysterical, in fact.
What's our e.t.a. at Pacifica,
Mister LaForge?
Twenty two hours, fourteen
minutes.
Increase to warp six.
Aye sir.
Think anyone'll mind if we arrive
a little ahead of schedule?
I know I won't. I've been looking
forward to a nice swim.
You are aware Counselor, that the
Holodeck can be programed to
recreate an oceanic environment.
It's just not the same, Data.
Have you ever gone for a real
moonlight swim?
One can swim in moonlight?
How about you, Worf?
Swimming is too much like bathing.
-- Commander Riker.
I am receiving a Code Forty-Seven.
Verify.
It is a Code Forty-Seven, sir.
Starfleet emergency frequency.
Code Forty-Seven... Captain's eyes
only.
Riker on the bridge, Captain.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
What is it, Number One?
An incoming message -- Code Forty
Seven, sir.
Pipe it through.
This is an emergency communique.
It is not to be discussed with
fellow officers unless deemed
absolutely necessary. There will
be no computer record of said
transmission.
Understood.
Proceed with voice print
identification.
Picard, Jean-Luc. Captain, USS
Enterprise.
Voice print verified.
Walker...
Hello, Jean-Luc. Been a long
time.
Too long, my friend. Why are you
contacting me on this frequency?
It was a difficult decision. I
felt it was worth the risk.
Risk?!
It's about Starfleet... about
something we've always considered
to be impossible.
I don't understand.
I can't explain it now. We need
to talk, face to face.
You're using a Code Forty-Seven!
I have to know what this is all
about.
Not over subspace. No.
For God's sake Walker, you know
this is a secure channel --
-- No!
I want you to meet me on Dytallix B.
When?
Immediately.
Impossible. We're expected at
Pacifica --
-- That can wait.
You owe me. And you owe it to
yourself to hear what I have to
say.
Something's beginning... Have you
felt it?... Creeping out of the
woodwork...
An infestation.
What is?
Don't trust anyone. Remember
that, Jean-Luc. Don't take
anything for granted.
Walker --
-- Dytallix B. We'll be waiting.
Are you familiar with Dytallix
B, Lieutenant?
Uh, well...
If I may, sir? Dytallix B is one
of seven uninhabited worlds mined
for the Federation by the Dytallix
Mining Company. I believe B is
in the nearby Mira system.
Fine. Chart a course for it
immediately, warp seven. And
there will be no records or
logs mentioning any aspect of
this diversion.
Captain, they're expecting us at
Pacifica. Shouldn't we contact
them to let them know --
-- Negative, Will. Nothing goes
out without specific orders from
me.
Hopefully our delay will be
minimal.
I have the readout on Dytallix
B, Commander.
On screen.
Dytallix B is the fifth of six
planets circling the red giant
known as Mira.
One side always faces the sun --
where temperatures reach up to
one hundred and eighty degrees
Celsius. The mines line the
temperate zone between the day
and night sides, but they are
long deserted.
Why the devil would we be going
there? Are there any miners or
indigenous life forms on the
planet?
I believe the answer is negative
to both questions, sir. In a
manner of speaking, it is nothing
but a lifeless hunk of rock, a
useless ball of mud, a worthless
chunk of --
Thank you, Data. I get the idea.
Captain, we're approaching
Dytallix B.
Very good, Number One. I'm on
my way.
Captain, sensors are detecting
three Federation starships already
in orbit around the planet.
Identify.
Two are frigates: the Renegade
commanded by Tryla Scott, and the
Thomas Paine, Captain Rixx
commanding.
The third is just coming into
range now, sir... It is an
Ambassador Class heavy cruiser...
The USS Horatio.
Horatio?
Isn't that Walker Keel's ship?
Attempts at communication have
been ignored by all three vessels.
You will make no further attempts,
Mister Worf. Any life-form readings
on the surface, Mister Data?
Three sir. All gathered inside
what appears to be the entrance
to a mining tunnel.
Very well. Relay those
coordinates to the Transporter
Room. I'm beaming down.
Alone, Captain?
Alone, Number One.
Good to see you, Jean-Luc. Thanks
for coming.
This is some greeting, "old
friend."
Tell me Jean-Luc -- where did we
first meet?
Answer the question!
On Tau Ceti III. It was a bar --
Quite an exotic one at that.
What do I win?
Do you recall the night you
introduced Jack Crusher to
Beverly?
You know full well I hadn't even
met Beverly then. You introduced
them.
My brother introduced them.
You don't have a brother -- two
sisters, Anne and Melissa. Now
what the hell's this all about?!
Apologies, Captain. We had to
make sure you were really you.
Walker, what's going on?
Captain Picard, meet Captains
Scott and Rixx.
I believe we've met... The
Altairian conference?
Tryla Scott. It's said you made
captain faster than anyone in
Starfleet history, present company
included.
Are you that good?
Yes. I am.
Starfleet's finest.
Fancy meeting you here.
We all came secretly, Picard.
To discuss the threat.
What threat?
Have you noticed anything about
Starfleet Command lately?
Anything unusual?
No. We've been on the outer rim
for awhile. Haven't had much
contact with them.
Some of us have seen strange
patterns emerging. Unusual orders...
High-ranking officials backing
irrational proposals --
-- Starbase twelve was completely
evacuated for two full days! No
explanation given.
And what about the deaths?
Mckinney... Ryan Sipe... Onna
Karapleedeez...
All dead?
A series of "accidents".
Or so they say; it's hard to be
certain of anything. Interfleet
communications are at a minimum.
But something is happening.
And we fully expect the Enterprise
to be targeted soon.
Targeted for what? By whom?
We're not sure yet.
Dammit Jean-Luc, I tell you that
some of Starfleet's top command
people are changing! This could
affect the very core of our
organization. Officers I've known
for years are bluffing their way
through talk of old times!
That's their weakness! A lack
of memory.
He doesn't believe us. He thinks
we're crazy.
You've given me nothing to believe
in! Just vague talk of wild
schemes. Who's behind it, and for
what purpose? How are people
being changed?
I can't say exactly. But I think
its spread to my own ship.
My first officer hasn't been the
same since we stopped off at
Earth. Our medical officer says
he's perfectly normal, but I don't
think I trust him either.
Walker --
-- We know we don't have all the
answers. All we ask is that you
keep your eyes open.
That's sound advice at any time,
Captain.
Stay in touch with us -- covertly.
This meeting never took place as
far as Starfleet is concerned.
Please... I'm asking you as a
personal favor.
I'm glad, Jean-Luc... Glad you're
still one of us.
Tell Beverly... I said hello.
And watch your back, Picard.
It seems you're in turmoil.
Friends... close friends, are few
and far between. I'm a private
man, Deanna. My Starfleet duties
have shielded me from social
circles. My two oldest and
closest friends were Jack Crusher,
may he rest in peace, and Walker
Keel. Until various missions
split us apart, we were almost
inseparable.
I trust Keel completely. If he
felt it necessary to violate
regulations, I know he must have
a good reason.
And you are about to put your
career at risk for him.
Isn't that what friendship's all
about, Counselor?
-- They illicitly used the
emergency channel to draw you
here. Then they asked you to keep
secrets from your superiors.
Effectively, to disobey Starfleet
regulations.
The people involved are all of
the highest caliber. If I didn't
believe in their loyalty, I
wouldn't have gone this far.
Don't you think you should tell
the rest of the crew?
No. I won't risk implicating
them. Not until we have solid
evidence that something really is
wrong.
Take us out of orbit, Mister La
Forge.
Aye, sir.
Resume heading to Pacifica, warp
factor eight.
Aye sir, warp eight.
At that speed sir, we should
arrive nine point six three hours
behind the original schedule.
Very well. Data, I have an
assignment for you. One
especially suited to your talents.
Computer -- this is Lieutenant
Commander Data. Access all
Starfleet Command orders to
starships, starbases and colonies,
for the past six months.
Working.
I understand the Horatio was in
orbit around Dytallix. Did you
see Walker?
Yes. He asked me to say hello
to you.
I would have liked to have seen
him --
-- That wasn't possible, Doctor.
Captain... I'm picking up an
unusual disturbance in a nearby
quadrant.
Confirmed, sir. Sector
sixty-three.
Specify. What kind of
disturbance?
Hard to say at this distance,
Captain.
I suppose Pacifica can wait a
little longer.
Yes. Let's investigate. Maintain
speed and alter course
accordingly.
Aye sir, changing course to
three-five-one mark four.
Approaching Sector sixty-three,
sir.
Slow to impulse, Mister LaForge.
Aye sir, slowing to impulse.
Sensors beginning to pick up small
objects, Captain.
On screen.
Doesn't look natural.
Agreed.
Enlarge and identify.
It looks like... debris.
From a space vessel of some kind.
It could be one of the ships that
was orbiting Dytallix.
Agreed, sir. This sector is
in close proximity to that planet.
Any identifying marks, Worf?
Nothing so far... Sensors not
detecting any bodies in the
flotsam... but judging from the
amount of wreckage...
... I'm sorry sir.
It can only be the Horatio. She's
been totally destroyed.
Captain's personal log, stardate
41776.1. The death of my friend
Walker Keel, has had a powerful
impact on me. I now believe there
may be a cancer growing within
the ranks of Starfleet.
I've decided to alert my executive
officer to the suspicions voiced
by Keel and the other two captains.
There is no proof of anything.
The last time I saw Admiral Quinn
he tried to warn me of a subversion
inside the Federation. Then Walker
tried, and now he's dead.
Subversion? Personally I don't
believe in conspiracy theories.
Startling. Quite extraordinary,
in fact.
Directions unclear. Please repeat
request.
That was not a request. I was
simply... talking to myself.
A human idiosyncrasy triggered
by fascination with a particular
set of facts. Or sometimes
brought about by senility. Or,
used as a means of weighing
information before reaching a
conclusion. Or, as a --
-- Thank you, sir. I comprehend.
Continuing with record scan.
Intriguing.
I do not think the explosion of
the Horatio was an accident. It
was sabotage.
But we can't be certain.
Perhaps we can.
My orders were to search for
abnormal patterns in Starfleet's
directives. I believe I have
found just that.
These are various outposts and
starbases where I have detected
unusual activity over the past
few months.
What sort of activity?
An uncustomary reshuffling of
personnel, usually in the command
areas. The new officers have had
abnormally frequent contact with
the highest levels of Starfleet
Command.
Why hasn't anybody noticed this
before?
The orders were given with great
subtlety. To use an aphorism,
Starfleet's left hand did not know
what its right hand was doing.
Can you speculate as to the
purpose of these reassignments?
I believe it is a clandestine
attempt to control vital sectors
of Federation territory.
It could be a prelude to invasion.
But who's behind it?
There is insufficient data to make
such an assesment.
What do you suggest we do, warp
over to Starfleet headquarters
and demand to know what's going
on?
Why not?!
Yes...
... Why not indeed?
We're talking about a threat to
the entire future of the
Federation. I don't think any
of us can rest easy until we've
gone to the source.
Captain's personal log,
supplemental. We have altered
course and are traveling toward
Earth. I have apprised the
remaining bridge crew of our
situation.
Approaching Earth, sir.
Standard orbit, Mister LaForge.
Standard orbit, sir.
Any word from Starfleet Command,
Mister Data?
Nothing so far, sir.
Strange...
I have a message coming in from
Starfleet Command, Captain.
On screen.
Greetings Enterprise. I am
Admiral Savar. This is Admiral
Aaron, and I believe you know
Admiral Quinn.
Yes. Good to see you again,
Admiral.
And you, Captain.
Of course. We are always delighted
when the Enterprise returns to
the nest. Yet we are puzzled by
the timing of your visit.
Yes sir, I can imagine you would
be.
Governor Delaplane of Pacifica
informs us that you canceled your
scheduled stop there. Is this
true?
It is, sir.
Explain yourself, Captain. Why
have you returned to Earth?
That... is something I'd rather
discuss in person, Admiral.
Please excuse us a moment,
Captain.
They seem normal enough.
On the surface. Any thoughts
counselor?
Hard to say, sir. I sense that
someone is hiding something, but
I can't tell who or what.
I can't say I'm overjoyed to see
Remmick again.
Considering what we've done, their
response has been pretty
temperate.
I don't like it, Captain. We
can't trust --
Forgive the delay, Captain Picard.
We'd be delighted if you and your
first officer would join us for
dinner.
Yes. Delighted.
This should give you a good
opportunity to expatiate your
viewpoint.
To elaborate upon whatever it is
that's troubling you.
We accept your gracious offer.
Excellent. Preparations are
already underway.
We'll greet you in the reception
area in say... twenty minutes?
Fine.
I, uh, won't be able to attend the
dinner I'm afraid. But I would
like to see the ship and say hello
again, Captain.
Of course. Looking forward to
seeing you. Enterprise out.
Quinn wants to see us alone --
at least we know he's still on
our side.
Are you ready to beam up to the
Enterprise sir?
Yes, Commander, quite ready.
Welcome aboard, Greg. You
remember Commander Riker.
Yes, hello again Commander.
I must say, you're looking well.
Never felt better in my life.
Last time we met you told me how
tired you'd been feeling.
Tired of life, I was. But not
anymore. I look forward to new
challenges now.
I'd sure like to see some more
of the ship.
Remember what you told me back
at Relva 7? About the threat you
perceived to the very fabric of
the Federation?
Is that why you're here? Because
of what I said?
That's one of the reasons.
Jean-Luc! You took me far too
literally. I was only referring
to the difficulty involved in
assimilating new races into the
Federation.
It's an ongoing and tumultuous
process that can cause stress and
strain on all aspects of our
alliance.
I'm sorry... I must have
misunderstood.
I'm the one who should be
apologizing.
If I led you down the garden path,
I humbly ask forgiveness.
Of course.
Now gentlemen, I believe you have
a dinner to attend, while I would
like to freshen up a bit before
looking around some more.
We have a guest accommodation at
your disposal, sir.
Outstanding.
I should be getting down to the
planet. Commander Riker will be
at your disposal to show you
anything you'd like to see.
That's really not necessary --
-- I insist.
You can join me on Earth when the
admiral's tour is completed.
I may want to stay a while,
Jean-Luc.
Of course, Admiral. Stay as long
as you wish.
That's not Gregory Quinn. He may
look like him and sound like
him... but it isn't him.
Can you be absolutely certain,
sir.
I am certain, Number One. I want
you to go back to that cabin and
keep your eye on his every move.
Have Beverly concoct a reason for
a complete medical examination.
How?
I don't care how! Just do it!
Use force if necessary.
He's a senior admiral.
It's not him, Will. I know that
now. What we need to find out
is how he's been duplicated.
And who or what's behind it.
Captain... if you're right --
-- I am right.
-- Should you be beaming down
alone? Unarmed?
I'll take care. Find out what
you can, and then join me -- in
force if you believe it's
warranted.
Energize.
Good luck, sir.
Welcome home, Captain Picard.
Thank you, sir. My first officer
will be joining us shortly.
Yes, I'm sure he will.
You've met Commander Remmick,
haven't you?
Under less than ideal
circumstances. It is nice to see
you again, Captain.
I hope you have a healthy
appetite. We've prepared a
special meal in your honor.
I'm honored.
Tell me, why is it so quiet here?
The last time I saw this corridor
it was bustling with activity.
It often is. Tonight's a quiet
night.
Yes, a quiet night.
Let's have some Andonian tea while
we wait for your Riker. Then you
can tell us what's brought you here.
I see you keep up with our duty
roster.
Of course, Captain. The
Enterprise is very important to
us.
Ready for your tour, Admiral?
Quite ready, Commander.
What's in the case?
Actually... I brought this for
Doctor Crusher. But perhaps you'd
like you to see it first?
What is it?
A form of life. Discovered quite
accidentally by a survey team on
a distant uncharted planet.
Why haven't we heard anything
about that?
Oh, you'll be hearing more about
it shortly. But first there is
much scientific study to be done.
After all, this is a superior lifeform.
Superior?
Totally.
Now come, Riker. Take a good
look.
I think I'll summon our science
officer --
It won't like your science
officer. It likes you.
Now look!
Vitamins. They do wonders for
the body.
Ahh, your life is so painful now.
But soon you'll be one of us.
Riker to Security. Emergency --
I'd like to begin the discussion
of why I'm here.
In time Captain, in time. First,
a toast.
To the Horatio, gentlemen.
The Horatio.
What an awful tragedy. Such a
terrible loss of life.
It's interesting you mention the
Horatio. That's one of the things
I wanted to discuss.
Really?
Has the cause of her destruction
been ascertained?
Absolutely.
Implosion, due to extreme
negligence on the part of her
captain.
Drink up, Picard. I believe
you'll find it an excellent
aperitif.
It's good that you're here. He
slipped and hit his head.
This is Lieutenant LaForge in
Guest Quarter Sixteen. We have
a possible medical emergency.
Your Doctor Crusher is most
capable; I'm sure he'll be all
right. Now if you'll excuse me,
my time here is limited...
Come on, Klingon. It's just you
and me now...
Do Klingons fear death as much
as humans? I could snap your neck
in a second, but that wouldn't
be as much fun.
Are you all right?
If I could see... I'd be seeing
stars.
Who... what is he?
Let's find out.
Retinal scans are an exact match
... It really is Quinn!
How can that be? He picked me
up like a rag doll.
I'm going to run a complete
internal scan.
Keep me posted, Doctor. I'll
be on the bridge.
What is this?
What do you know of conspiracies,
Captain?
Not nearly enough I suppose.
But that's the charming thing
about them, isn't it? When a
machination is real, no one knows
about it. And when it's
suspected, it's almost never real.
Except of course, in the paranoid
delusions of those who believe.
Sorry to interrupt. Dinner is
served.
Wonderful! Bantering with the
captain has given me quite an
appetite.
I'd like to contact my ship. To
inform Commander Riker that we're
ready to sit down.
Of course, Captain. We'll wait
for you at the table.
Picard to Riker.
Doctor Crusher here, Captain.
May I speak freely?
I suppose we have no choice.
Where's Riker?
He was attacked by Quinn. Or what
We thought was Quinn.
Specify, Doctor.
A parasitic being has invaded his
body. It has complete control
over all brain functions. It
seems to breath through a small
"gill" protruding through the back
of Quinn's neck. Look for this,
Captain. I believe it will be
visible on anyone who has been
compromised.
Any idea what it is or where it
comes from?
Negative. I've never seen
anything like it before.
Lieutenant Worf. If the situation
is under control, we could use
you on the bridge.
It's okay. He won't be waking
up for a long time.
Continue, Doctor.
By the placement of the tendrils,
the parasite appears to stimulate
the vicim's adrenal glands which
generate great strength and
resistence to --
-- Spare me the medical details,
Doctor. Just tell me if you can
remove it.
Not without killing the patient.
You must set your phaser on kill,
Captain. Stun has little effect --
Doctor, one does not beam into
Starfleet Headquarters armed.
Your food is getting cold,
Captain.
About to go to dinner now, Doctor.
Have Riker join me when he's
available. Picard out.
Go ahead and start, Captain. We
don't stand on ceremony around
here.
Oh do eat up, Picard. Just raise
your hand if you want seconds.
You're not going anywhere.
You'll be one of us soon.
You were meant for the doctor.
It couldn't be helped. Riker
walked in on us unexpectedly.
No matter. The doctor will soon
be joining us. All in good time.
Ah, Captain Scott. Good, the
setting is now complete.
You didn't really think we were
in the dark about your intentions,
did you?
Patience is one of our virtues,
Captain. Instead of going after
you, we allowed you to come to
us.
More dramatic this way, don't you
think?
Yes... one thing both races share
is a love of theatre. And you've
put on a fine show.
What exactly is your race? Where
do you come from?
It's not important. Let's just
say... we've come a long way to
join you.
It's a perfect match. We're the
brains and you're the brawn.
You'll understand soon, Picard.
Indeed. We've been moving slowly,
cautiously, for many months now.
Careful to cover our tracks.
Careful not to arouse suspicion,
until it's too late.
And it is too late. For you, that
is.
Well said, brother. Picard and
Riker control the Enterprise.
Which means we control the
Enterprise.
Eat hearty, brother! Relish your
new body!
Aaron!
Hold it, Aaron!
Come on!
Can I help you, gentlemen?
Is there any trouble? Perhaps
if you'd tell me what it is --
-- Remmick!
No, Will!
You don't understand.
We mean you no harm. We seek
co-existence.
Captain's log, stardate 41780.2.
Admiral Quinn is expected to make
a full recovery...
There is no trace of the parasite
which took control of him. We'll
never know how many of these
life-forms infiltrated Starfleet,
but it seems they could not
survive without the "mother
creature" which had taken over
Commander Remmick...
... Still, the haunting question
remains... Who were these
beings... and will we ever have
to face them again?
It was Doctor Crusher's idea to
simulate the blue splinter. We
had to make sure it would fool
everyone, including you.
That it did, Number One. Rest
assured.
I have attempted to trace the
message Remmick was sending. I
believe it was aimed at an
unexplored quadrant of our galaxy.
Any idea what the message was,
Data?
Well... I believe it was a beacon.
A beacon?
Yes, Captain. A homing beacon...
sent from Earth.
