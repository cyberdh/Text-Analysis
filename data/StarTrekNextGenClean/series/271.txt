			So why were you rolling around in
			Cypirion cactus?
			Do you know Rebecca White?
			The new Tactical officer...
			We went for a walk in the
			Arboretum... we sat down... got
			comfortable... things got a
			little romantic...
			Then I rolled over.
			Blurred vision... dizziness...
			palpitations... a stinging
			sensation in the lower spine...
			it's Terrelian Death Syndrome,
			isn't it?
			I thought we agreed you'd come to
			me before checking the Starfleet
			Medical Database.
			Yeah, well.. this time I'm glad I
			did... maybe we've caught the
			cellular decay before it's too
			late.
			Reg. You don't have Terrelian
			Death Syndrome.
			You... you're sure?
			I'm sure.
			Then I guess it must be...
			Symbalene blood burn.
			No, no... I don't see anything
			wrong with you at all...
			Wait a minute... there is a slight
			imbalance in your K-three cell
			count.
			My K-threes... oh, no...
			Barclay... I'm sure it's nothing.
			Let me run a micro-cellular
			scan...
			This will take a couple of
			minutes.
			You should leave a couple of those
			in... just to teach him a lesson.
			Charming bedside manner...
			How's my smallest patient doing?
			I believe she is doing well. Her
			appetite has increased by seven
			percent, and she is starting to
			engage in pre-natal behavior.
			She's getting close. You'll have
			a fresh litter of hungry kittens
			before the week is over. Let me
			run an amniotic scan, just to make
			sure everything's fine... and then --
			Doctor -- my capillaries are
			shrinking!
			Alissa, could you take care of
			Spot for a minute? Start a
			preliminary amniotic scan...
			Yes, Doctor.
			My intravascular pressure -- it's
			... it's gone right through the
			roof.
			You're right... it's elevated.
			You've also got heightened
			electrophoretic activity.
			Electrophoretic activity... is it
			serious?
			Well... based on this, I'd say
			you've got...
			Seventy... maybe eighty years.
			Eighty years!
			Eighty years?
			Yes, Reg. What you have is a mild
			case of Urodelan Flu. It's
			nothing serious. Most humans have
			a natural immunity to it... but it
			looks like the T-cell in your DNA
			that would normally fight off this
			infection is dormant.
			So I have... bad genes?
			You have one dormant gene out of
			a hundred thousand, and I can
			activate that gene with a
			synthetic T-cell -- let your body
			attack the infection naturally.
			You should be fine in a couple of
			days.
			Thank you, Doctor. I... I feel
			much better now.
			Good. Now stay away from that
			Medical Database...
			And you stay out of the Arboretum.
			Everything looks fine, Data. You
			want to know the sex of the
			kittens?
			I have noticed that many humans
			prefer not to know in order to
			experience the surprise during
			birth. I believe I will preserve
			the mystery until then.
			I know what you mean... I don't
			want to know either.
			Alissa... ?
			Spot's not the only one who's
			going to be a mother.
			Alissa, that's wonderful!
			How did Andrew take the news?
			He was a little shocked... but
			he's getting over it.
			I have spent the past nine weeks
			as an expectant parent. I would
			be happy to share my insights with
			your husband.
			If my experience is any indication --
			he will need all the help he can
			get.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47653.2.
			We are performing field tests of
			our new tactical systems and
			weapon upgrades. Mister Worf is
			supervising the exercises.
			Our next test will involve the new
			photon torpedoes. The explosive
			yield has been increased by eleven
			percent... and I have enhanced the
			targeting systems for increased
			accuracy.
			Sounds fascinating, Mister Worf.
			Please proceed.
			Setting targeting coordinates to
			zero-zero-five mark three-one-seven...
			spread pattern delta
			nine-four...
			Torpedoes armed and loaded.
			Fire when ready.
			Worf?
			One of the torpedoes has veered
			off course. It appears to be a
			malfunction in the guidance
			system.
			Abort and destroy.
			Torpedo is not responding... the
			subspace detonator will not
			engage.
			Lock phasers...
			The torpedo is out of range.
			Even with your new, improved
			phasers?
			Maintain a sensor lock on the
			torpedo -- we'll have to go after
			it.
			That would be inadvisable, sir.
			The asteroid field is unusually
			dense -- the Enterprise is too
			large to navigate through it
			safely.
			Then I'll take a shuttlecraft to
			retrieve it.
			Mister Data, you're with me.
			Captain -- the shuttle pilot on
			duty is Lieutenant Hayes...
			I happen to be a reasonably
			qualified pilot, Number One.
			Besides, these... tests hardly
			require the Captain's personal
			attention.
			Understood. Enjoy yourself, sir.
			In the meantime, Mister Worf --
			you should consider analyzing your
			new guidance system.
			Captain, I will need a few minutes
			to take care of some personal
			affairs.
			Me?
			It is possible that it will take
			several days for Captain Picard
			and me to complete our mission.
			I would prefer to have a human
			present to supervise the birthing
			process.
			Well... I'd be honored...
			I have noticed that you are the
			only other member of the crew whom
			Spot seems to like.
			Really? I find that hard to
			believe. She's such a sweet
			little kitty...
			She is to you. However there have
			been several... injuries when
			other crewmembers have attempted
			to care for her.
			So... has she picked the place?
			The... "place"?
			Cats usually like to pick out a
			specific location to give birth...
			It's usually someplace dark... and
			secluded...
			I'll bet this is it.
			I'm curious, Data. Who's the
			father?
			I am not certain. Spot has
			escaped from my quarters on
			several occasions. And there are
			twelve male felines on board.
			I intend to run a full DNA
			analysis on the kittens once they
			are --
			Picard to Data. Report to
			Shuttlebay Two.
			On my way, Captain.
			Goodbye, Spot. I believe you are
			in... good hands.
			Don't worry about a thing, sir!
			Problem?
			I have performed thirteen
			diagnostics of the weapons array,
			and I can find nothing wrong with
			the guidance system.
			I'll have Geordi run a diagnostic
			of the torpedo bay itself... maybe
			he can find something.
			Must you to stand so close to me?
			Lieutenant... are you alright?
			I am... fine, sir.
			No, you're not. You've been
			working for the past six hours.
			You're tired. Take a break.
			But sir --
			That's an order, Worf.
			Thanks for waiting.
			Do not approach me unannounced --
			especially while I am eating.
			Worf... we were supposed to have
			lunch together, remember?
			I was hungry.
			Well, I'm hungry too...
			Bring me an order of... Ongilin
			caviar. Make that a double order.
			Caviar... for lunch?
			I'm in the mood for something
			salty. Besides, it's no stranger
			than what you're eating.
			Have you noticed how dry the air
			is on the ship? I wonder if the
			environmental controls are set
			properly....
			You're excused.
			Is something wrong?
			It has been a difficult day. The
			torpedo guidance system failed...
			it was my fault.
			You always say that, Worf...
			It was my fault. I designed the
			guidance system.
			Worf... calm down.
			I think you're under more stress
			than you'd like to admit. Maybe
			you should get some rest...
			Yes... perhaps you are right.
			Excuse me.
			I didn't mean right now...
			We removed the torpedo bay's
			primary guidance module and found
			a power fluctuation in the forward
			sensor cluster and we think there
			may be a radial imbalance in the
			phase discriminator. Now what we
			want to do next is run a level
			four diagnostic, but that's going
			to mean shutting down auxiliary
			power to nineteen decks and --
			Wait... slow down... I lost you
			back there...
			Which sensor cluster?
			The forward. It's... it's a power
			fluctuation in the converter
			nodes. Minor adjustment -- minor.
			It's all right in here in this
			diagram, sir.
			I'll... take a look at this later.
			In the meantime, go ahead and run
			your diagnostic. I'll notify all
			departments about the power shutdown.
			I'll check that!
			He's full of energy today.
			I can't get him to slow down.
			He's been working since late last
			night...
			Looks like a plasma conduit just
			cut out in Junction Seventeen.
			I'll go take a look...
			Hold on, Reg -- I'll go with you!
			We'll keep you posted, sir.
			Computer, increase ambient air
			temperature by two degrees
			Centigrade... and increase
			relative humidity another ten
			percent.
			Computer, reset environmental
			controls to standard.
			Worf, it's freezing in here.
			You have already raised the
			temperature three times. It is
			too hot.
			Live with it.
			Computer, execute my original
			command.
			I need a bath...
			You have the Bridge.
			Here we are.
			It looks like the conduit
			ruptured. No problem, I'll just
			bypass it...
			Reg... wait a second... look at
			the corroded edges... and the
			blast pattern. This conduit
			didn't just rupture on its own...
			it looks like something dissolved
			the bulkhead and ate through the
			conduit...
			And that... that caused the
			rupture?
			I think so. Whatever dissolved
			the bulkhead was highly
			corrosive... but it's not like
			any solvent I've ever seen...
			There's a high level of cholic
			acid here... enzymatic agents...
			If I didn't know any better, I'd
			say this solvent was organic.
			Maybe we should run a bio-spectral
			analysis of the solvent... take a
			closer look.
			Good idea. But let's take a break
			first, give ourselves a chance to --
			You go ahead, sir. I'll take care
			of it.
			I don't know what's gotten into
			you, Reg...
			Computer, adjust temperature to
			twenty-nine degrees Celsius...
			relative humidity to ninety
			percent.
			It's awfully hot in here.
			Counselor Troi would not let us
			turn down the temperature.
			Where is she? This is supposed to
			be her watch.
			She said she needed... a bath.
			A bath?
			Yes sir.
			Permission to be excused. I am
			not... feeling well.
			Commander, we received a
			communication from Starfleet.
			They wanted to know when they
			could expect your performance
			analysis of the new weapon
			systems.
			The weapon systems... ?
			Yes, sir.
			The ones we've been testing for
			the past few days... ?
			Oh, that's right...
			What should I tell them, sir?
			Tell them... we're not finished
			yet...
			Worf... what are you doing in
			here?
			I had to be with you...
			Well, as you can see, I'm a little
			busy right now. Please come back
			later.
			Computer, increase water
			temperature by five degrees.
			Get out of the water. Now.
			Worf... what do you think you're --
			Leave me alone, or I'm going to
			call security.
			It's just so cold in here...
			May I have a glass of water... ?
			Your temperature has dropped eight
			degrees. I want to run a
			hypothalamic series right away.
			Doctor, we've had three other
			crewmembers complaining about the
			temperature levels. Some feel
			like they have fevers... others
			are freezing, like Counselor Troi.
			Call Doctor Selar and Doctor
			Hacopian. We may have some kind
			of viral infection going around.
			I'm going to check on Worf...
			Worf, have you had any unusual
			symptoms lately? Headaches...
			nausea... dizziness?
			Worf? Worf... can you hear me?
			I think we'd better run a full bio-scan.
			I want you to lie down.
			Worf, lie down...
			Okay... we'll do this sitting up.
			What's this... ?
			Worf, how long have you had this
			on your neck?
			It's full of some sort of bioacidic
			compound... almost like a
			venom sack...
			Open your mouth.
			I managed to get her into stasis
			before the venom paralyzed her.
			She's going to need reconstructive
			surgery... but I
			think she'll be alright.
			Sir, we analyzed the venom and
			compared it to the acidic compound
			we found in Junction Seventeen...
			and on Decks Ten and Twelve. They
			all have the same enzymatic
			composition...
			Are you saying that Mister Worf
			has been... spraying this...
			this...
			Venom.
			Venom... all over the ship?
			I'd say so.
			Commander, sixty crewmen have
			begun to exhibit strange
			behavioral changes.
			Memory loss... fatigue...
			headaches...
			Doctor Selar and I are trying to
			coordinate everything... but we're
			having a tough time understanding
			what we're dealing with.
			I think one thing is clear...
			there's some sort of disease
			aboard the Enterprise... and it's
			spreading.
			I'm having trouble concentrating
			myself... it's like my mind
			keeps... wandering... I can't...
			Commander -- I have seven security
			teams hunting for Worf, but for
			some reason sensors are having
			trouble locking onto him. I've
			called a Level Two Security Alert --
			do you think we should go to a
			Level One?
			I... don't know. What do you
			think?
			I think we should...
			Okay... sounds good... then you'll
			take care of that... security
			thing, won't you?
			Yes sir.
			I'll... contact Starfleet... let
			them know what's happening. You
			have your orders. Dismissed.
			Computer, send a subspace message
			to Starfleet command... security
			channel, authorization...
			Alpha-four seven authorization
			required to activate security
			channel.
			Computer...
			Awaiting authorization.
			Captain's Log, supplemental.
			Commander Data and I have
			recovered the stray torpedo after
			a three day search. We are
			enroute back to the Enterprise.
			Captain, the ship is not at the
			pre-arranged coordinates.
			Have they been delayed?
			I do not know. I am unable to
			raise them on any communication
			channel.
			Scan the vicinity... see if you
			can find them...
			The Enterprise appears to be
			adrift. I am reading power
			fluctuations on all decks...
			Life signs?
			There are life signs, but the
			sensor readings are highly
			distorted. I am unable to
			identify specific lifeforms.
			Adjust our axial stabilizers to
			match the attitude and rotation
			rate of the Enterprise...
			I'm going to dock the shuttle
			manually...
			Main power is off-line. All
			systems are in Emergency or Standby
			mode... and there is no
			response from any manned station.
			Any sign of the crew?
			I cannot access the internal
			sensors from here. We will have
			to go to the Bridge.
			What's that smell?
			It is a mixture of methane, uric
			acid and ammonia. There is also
			an abundance of pheromones in the
			air.
			That sounds like... animals.
			Yes, sir. I am able to discern
			over three hundred different
			vocalizations.
			Look at this...
			It is composed of reptilian DNA...
			I believe it is an epidermal layer
			that has been cast off during
			molting.
			But it seems to be humanoid...
			Yes, sir. I cannot explain it.
			There are no species aboard the
			Enterprise that shed their skin in
			this fashion.
			This is Commander Troi's
			quarters... can you tell if she's
			inside?
			No, sir.
			I want to take a look inside.
			Stand ready.
			The environmental settings in this
			room have been altered...
			Deanna!
			What's happened to her... ?
			Her DNA is in a state of ribocyatic
			flux... her genetic codes
			are being re-sequenced... and her
			cells are mutating as a result.
			At a fundamental level, she is no
			longer human.
			What... is she?
			Her respiratory tissue has become
			capable of metabolizing water as
			well as air... and her eyes have
			developed nictitating membranes...
			I believe she has become...
			amphibian, sir.
			She's been injured...
			There is Klingon DNA in the wound.
			It is saliva.
			You mean, she's been bitten?
			It would appear so.
			I will need to run a full biospectral
			analysis.
			First we've got to get the ship
			under control... let's go to the
			Bridge.
			His upper spinal column has been
			broken in three places.
			It looks like he's been attacked
			by some sort of animal...
			Has his DNA changed, as well?
			Yes. However, the mutation was in
			its initial stages when he died.
			I've restored attitude control to
			the ship. But I can't get main
			power back on-line... it looks
			like the entire power transfer
			grid has been destroyed...
			Captain, I am picking up one
			thousand eleven individual life
			readings within the ship. All
			exhibit a genetic flux similar to
			the one we observed in Counselor
			Troi.
			Then the entire ship has been
			affected...
			Most of the lifeforms are
			scattered throughout ship's
			quarters... but there are several
			large concentrations in the
			arboretum, and the aquatics lab.
			Commander Riker... ?
			Wil... ?
			His cranial plates have thickened
			by twenty percent -- his brain is
			much smaller, sir. I doubt he can
			comprehend our language.
			I think he's trying to
			communicate...
			Wil, can you --
			He looks almost... proto-human.
			Yes, sir. His DNA would seem to
			confirm that observation.
			Captain... I believe the crew is
			de-evolving.
			This tranquilizer should keep him
			unconscious for another seven
			hours.
			What have you found out?
			I have analyzed Commander Riker's
			DNA structure. A synthetic T-cell
			has invaded his genetic code.
			This T-cell has begun to activate
			his latent introns.
			Introns?
			They are genetic codes which are
			normally dormant. They are
			evolutionary holdovers --
			sequences of DNA that provided key
			physical and behavioral
			characteristics millions of years
			ago, but are no longer necessary.
			For instance, Counselor Troi's
			gill slits and other amphibious
			characteristics were derived from
			introns which still contain
			amphibious codes.
			So these... introns are causing
			her DNA to re-combine in an
			earlier configuration?
			That is correct. In her case, the
			DNA is creating an amphibious
			lifeform which became extinct over
			fifty million years ago.
			Commander Riker's introns are
			changing him into one of the
			earlier hominids...
			Yes, sir. I would say...
			Australopithacine.
			Each of these stages is another
			link in the evolutionary chain,
			stretching back to the origins of
			all lifeforms on Earth.
			Because introns can include
			genetic material from many
			different species over millions of
			years of evolution, it is possible
			that a wide variety of
			transformations is occurring among
			the crew.
			What about crewmembers who are not
			from Earth?
			All humanoid life has a similar
			genetic pattern. The virus should
			affect non-human crewmembers in
			the same way. They are each deevolving
			to earlier forms of life
			on their homeworlds.
			I feel I must point out, sir, that
			you have become infected with the
			intron virus, as well.
			How long before I start to change?
			According to my calculations,
			within the next twelve hours, you
			will begin to exhibit the first
			signs of your eventual
			transformation.
			Which will be what... ?
			I believe you will also de-evolve
			into some form of early primate.
			Possibly similar to a lemur, or
			pygmy marmoset.
			Well... before I begin scurrying
			about, searching for food, we need
			to find some answers.
			How do we reverse the process?
			I am uncertain. We will need to
			run several micro-cellular scans.
			However, the ship's main computer
			has been damaged. Possibly by
			crewmembers who did not know what
			they were doing.
			The computer in my quarters has an
			independent processing and memory
			storage unit, and should not be
			affected. I suggest we work from
			there.
			Agreed.
			I believe Spot has had her
			kittens.
			They sound hungry.
			Yes. I am curious as to why Spot
			is not taking care of them.
			Spot... ?
			It would seem the intron virus
			isn't limited to humanoid
			lifeforms.
			No, sir.
			What is it?
			These kittens were born within the
			last twenty-four hours. It
			appears that Spot's transformation
			took place at approximately the
			same time.
			So... Spot gave birth to the
			kittens while she was... changing
			into a reptilian form?
			I believe so. For some reason,
			the intron virus was not passed on
			to the kittens. I do not know
			why.
			As I remember my biology, there
			are several natural immune systems
			that come into play in the womb of
			the mother... to protect the
			unborn from viral infections...
			That is true. The placental
			barrier, maternal antibodies and
			amniotic fluid all serve as a
			filtration system.
			Maybe we could... inhibit this
			intron virus by using some of the
			natural antibodies in Spot's
			amniotic fluid...
			It would take further research,
			but I believe that to be effective
			on humanoid crewmembers, humanoid
			antibodies would be necessary.
			Then perhaps we should locate a
			humanoid who's pregnant...
			Nurse Ogawa recently became
			pregnant...
			Then we need to locate Nurse
			Ogawa.
			I have traced her combadge signal
			to Deck Seventeen, Section Twentyone
			Alpha.
			The Arboretum...
			One of the warp plasma vents has
			failed. Main Engineering has been
			abandoned -- there is no one there
			to fix the problem.
			I can repair the damaged plasma
			vent from here.
			I'd better check the status of the
			warp core...
			Data!
			What was that?
			I believe it was Lieutenant
			Barclay. He appeared to be
			partially transformed into an
			arachnid.
			A spider?
			I recognized the chitin
			colorations. He is becoming a
			member of the Pisauridae family.
			Captain. Are you all right?
			I have the most intense feeling
			of... fear... panic... as if I
			were being watched...
			I can't explain it.
			You may be experiencing the
			initial stages of your
			transformation. Early primates
			were often prey for larger
			carnivores -- as a result, their
			instincts probably included a
			heightened sense of awareness.
			If that's the case, then my
			instincts tell me... we'd better
			hurry.
			Captain.
			I have analyzed Nurse Ogawa's
			embryo. It has been unaffected by
			the virus. I believe I can use
			her amniotic fluid as a template
			for a retro-virus. It would
			neutralize the synthetic T-cell,
			and re-establish the original
			genetic patterns of each host.
			How soon can you have it ready?
			It will not take long to isolate
			the appropriate genetic material.
			However, I will need to get the
			Sickbay computer back on --
			What -- what's that?
			It is large, approximately two
			hundred kilograms... and it is
			heavily armored with an exoskeleton
			of some sort...
			The lifesigns appear to be...
			Klingon.
			Worf...
			Set your phaser to heavy stun.
			We have no way of knowing if the
			stun setting will have any effect
			on him, sir. And a higher setting
			may kill him.
			Listen to that... he sounds
			angry... aggressive...
			What does Worf want... is he
			responding to some sort of
			predatory instinct? Does he see
			us as prey?
			There are crewmembers in the
			corridors and other sections of
			the ship. It would be much easier
			for him to capture and consume one
			of them, rather than attempt to
			break through a door.
			Then... what does he want?
			Predators use vocalizations to
			frighten off other predators... to
			mark territory... and to initiate
			the mating process...
			The mating process...
			Counselor Troi has been bitten by
			a Klingon... but it's not in a
			life-threatening location...
			nowhere near a major artery or
			organ...
			And look at the wound itself...
			the penetration of the bite is
			very shallow, as if he didn't
			intend to seriously injure her...
			What are you suggesting, Captain?
			Is it possible that Worf thinks of
			Troi as his mate?
			If that is true, then he must now
			by trying to reach her.
			We... we can't just leave. We've
			got to stay here and protect
			her... and keep working on the
			retro-virus...
			If we can't stun him, then we'll
			have to distract him somehow...
			lure him away from Deanna...
			The mating instinct is quite
			strong in Klingon biology. I am
			not certain what would serve as an
			effective lure.
			Klingons have a highly developed
			sense of smell... if we could
			duplicate Deanna's pheromones, we
			might be able to convince him she
			has left Sickbay... and is
			somewhere else on the ship...
			I am extracting a blood sample
			from one of her sebaceous glands,
			where pheromones are produced.
			I believe I can activate the
			pheromones with a bio-activant
			solution.
			Can you amplify the pheromones?
			They'll have to be far more
			powerful than Deanna's actual
			scent.
			I believe this will produce the
			desired effect.
			I will use it to draw Worf to a
			different part of the ship.
			No... you... you must stay here...
			continue working on the retro-virus...
			I'll go...
			Captain, that would be extremely
			unwise. Worf may be much faster
			than --
			No time... no time to argue.
			Computer -- activate medical
			database.
			Main computer systems are inactive --
			unable to comply.
			Computer, bypass database system --
			activate local subprocessors only.
			Acknowledged.
			Deck Seventeen.
			Computer, display progress of
			genetic re-sequencing.
			Genetic re-sequencing in progress --
			DNA to seventy percent normal.
			Computer, increase nucleotide
			substitution by thirty-two
			percent.
			Data to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead.
			The retro-virus is working. I can
			release it into the ship's
			atmosphere in a gaseous state, but
			it will take some time to take
			effect.
			Acknowledged.
			Are you all right, sir?
			I'm fine, Mister Data. Proceed...
			Well, Mister Worf... let's hope
			you wake up feeling like a new
			man.
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			Commander Data has succeeded in
			returning the crew to normal.
			Doctor Crusher has determined that
			the synthetic T-cell she used to
			cure Mister Barclay's Urodelan flu
			initiated the intron virus which
			swept through the ship.
			So... this was my fault...
			No... in a way, it was mine. I
			didn't realize it at the time, but
			there's an anomaly in your genetic
			chemistry that caused the
			synthetic T-cell to mutate...
			Instead of just activating one
			dormant gene, it started to
			activate all of them -- including
			your introns.
			And that... that caused me to devolve...
			Along with every other member of
			the crew. The T-cell became
			airborne and started to spread
			like a virus...
			You know, Reg... this is a
			completely new disease. And it's
			traditional to classify a new
			disease with the name of the first
			diagnosed patient...
			You mean... you want to name the
			disease... after me?
			That's right. How about...
			"Barclay's Proto-morphosis
			Syndrome"?
			"Barclay's Proto-morphosis"...
			it... it has a nice ring to it...
			Thank you, Doctor...
			He transformed into a spider...
			and now he's had a disease named
			after him...
			I think I'd better clear my
			calender for the next few weeks.
