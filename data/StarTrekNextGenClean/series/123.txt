			All hands, this is the captain.
			The sun in the Delos system is
			undergoing large-scale magnetic
			field changes, producing violent,
			gigantic flares.
			We will be studying this star
			at close range. Even though we
			will be running with full
			deflectors, the closeness of the
			event and its severity are going
			to create problems.
			Intense magnetic fields have a
			disruptive effect on electrical
			systems. We can therefore expect
			an interruption of communications,
			and potential temporary loss of
			other systems. As a precaution,
			we are now going to Yellow
			Alert...
			Stay sharp, everyone.
			Engineering, this is Ops. Bring
			all systems on line and direct
			full power to the shields.
			All sections secure.
			Lieutenant LaForge?
			Course set.
			Half impulse.
			Half impulse, aye.
			On Main Viewer.
			Mask out the photosphere.
			Magnify. Quadrant one-seven,
			sector four-zero-three.
			I've never seen anything like
			this before. The violence of
			these eruptions is awesome.
			And humbling, Number One.
			Reading an unusual number of
			sunspots and eruptive prominences,
			sir. The magnetic field is
			extremely irregular.
			Captain, deflectors are being hit
			by a huge burst of X-rays.
			Wow -- look!
			Sir, my console seems to be
			overloading.
			The X-ray burst is disrupting
			systems, Captain. I'm adjusting
			deflectors to compensate.
			Increase power to forward deflectors.
			Status report.
			All systems operational, sir.
			Captain. The level of tension
			on the ship is mounting.
			Understandable. Data?
			If we are to investigate this
			unusual solar activity -- we must
			get closer.
			Mister LaForge, move us closer.
			We'll be pushing our deflectors
			to the limit, but we'll get a good
			look at this phenomenon.
			Captain, I have intercepted what
			seems to be a distress signal.
			Let me hear it.
			This... (garbled) -- this is
			... (garbled) -- on the freighter
			Sanction... (garbled) ... and
			unable to... (garbled) .... Need
			help.
			The transmission is from a
			freighter in orbit around the
			fourth planet of the system.
			However, the receiving station
			is on the third planet.
			Open hailing frequency.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			Unidentified freighter, this is
			the USS Enterprise. May we be
			of assistance?
			Whoever you are, YES!
			(garbled) .... cannot maintain...
			(garbled) ... if you can help...
			Can't you enhance the image?
			Too much interference.
			Set a course to intersect with
			the freighter. Warp two.
			Aye, sir.
			Maintain Yellow Alert.
			Can't control... (garbled) ... ship
			is losing orbit... (garbled) ...
			heading into atmosphere...
			without help, we'll burn up.
			It is a freighter -- very old.
			Captain, our sensors are being
			severely affected by the sun
			flares.
			Helm -- get us in as close as
			possible to the freighter's
			orbit.
			Aye, sir.
			There are six life forms aboard
			the freighter.
			Captain, the freighter's orbit
			is decaying.
			How long until it loses integrity?
			A matter of minutes.
			Unidentified freighter, this is
			the USS Enterprise.
			Enterprise, this is the Aurelian
			freighter... Sanction.
			Put this on the Main Viewer.
			The visual transmission is still
			breaking up.
			Freighter, this is the Enterprise.
			What is your situation?
			... (garbled) ... We are...
			Get us off here.
			Please -- help us.
			This is the Enterprise -- with
			all this interference it is
			difficult to copy your
			transmission -- if you all talk
			at once... it is impossible. Now
			-- please -- say again. What is
			your situation?
			I am T'Jon -- the captain of the
			Sanction.
			At last.
			How can we help?
			We have lost -- I don't know...
			something -- and I am no longer
			able to maintain this orbit, nor
			am I able to use main thrusters.
			Everything's just kind of... you
			know... dead, I guess. It's
			all... you know... shut down.
			That's very vague. What's the
			computer analysis?
			The computer's not working very
			well.
			Data... can you tap into their
			computer and clarify the
			situation?
			I will attempt it.
			Captain, the tractor beam is
			available, if you want it.
			At least we can pull them out of
			orbit before they enter the
			atmosphere.
			Yes. Captain T'Jon -- we are
			going to lock on our tractor beam
			and pull you out of orbit.
			Hey -- that's great.
			The solar flares are interfering
			with the tractor beam, Captain.
			I am unable to lock on.
			Captain, the freighter's orbit
			continues to deteriorate.
			Captain T'Jon, we are unable to
			attach our tractor beam because
			of the intense solar activity.
			I understand.
			Thanks for trying.
			Captain, I have determined what
			is malfunctioning on the
			freighter.
			Enterprise to Sanction. We have
			analyzed your problem.
			Great.
			Your ship's design uses an
			electromagnetic coil to constrict
			the exhaust flow. That coil is
			misaligned.
			Have you the necessary tools to
			realign the coil?
			I don't think so.
			Captain, I believe we can provide
			the freighter with a temporary
			substitute. Ship's stores contain
			a coil of the proper type.
			Can we beam it over?
			Yes.
			Captain T'Jon, we will beam over
			a replacement coil.
			That's great... and that will fix
			us up?
			Well, once it's installed.
			Right.
			... And how do we do that?
			What's the matter with these
			people? How can he be the captain
			of the vessel and be ignorant of
			its simplest functions?
			If this weren't so serious it
			would make you laugh.
			Captain T'Jon -- how long have
			you been in command of the
			freighter?
			Seven years. This is my
			twenty-sixth voyage to Brekka.
			And you don't know how to align
			a control coil?
			It's never come up.
			Is there anyone on board who can
			do it?
			Hold on a minute... I'll ask.
			Sorry -- nobody here knows
			anything about it.
			I'll beam over with a team.
			Captain -- I strongly recommend
			against anyone from this ship
			beaming over. The solar
			interference is too great.
			The freighter has entered the
			planet's atmosphere.
			Disintegration is imminent.
			We are running out of options.
			Let's get them off there.
			Captain T'Jon. Prepare to beam
			over.
			If you think that's best.
			Unless you have another option
			-- yes, I "think that's best."
			Whatever you say.
			I can't maintain a positive lock.
			An unusual E-M burst. Readings
			off scale.
			Freighter Sanction, this is the
			Enterprise. We are having
			difficulty getting a fix.
			Have them go to their own
			Transporter Room. It will be
			tricky, but perhaps I can link
			the two transporters in series
			and get them over with the
			increased power.
			It's worth a try.
			Captain T'Jon -- go immediately
			to your Transporter Room.
			Contact me from there.
			Right, Enterprise -- we'll call
			you from there... but, if you
			can't get us with your
			transporter, what makes you think
			ours will do the job?
			I'm going to interconnect them.
			I didn't know you could do that.
			Hurry -- we're running out of
			time.
			We're on the way.
			I don't think they're going to
			make it.
			Captain T'Jon doesn't seem to
			care one way or the other.
			Worf -- how much time do we have?
			One minute, twenty-eight seconds.
			Captain T'Jon -- are you there?
			Yeah. We're in the transporter
			room.
			Great. Activate your transporter.
			Set coordinates nine -- seven --
			zero -- three... mark two...
			six... eight.
			Did you say... two -- eight --
			six... or eight -- eight -- six.
			TWO -- SIX -- EIGHT.
			Got it.
			The hull temperature of the
			freighter is passing three
			thousand degrees.
			What's the holdup, Number One?
			We are establishing the link now.
			We are ready.
			Then all six of you get on the
			transporter platform -- on my
			signal, energize.
			I've got their initial transporter
			signal. Interlock complete.
			Energize on my mark. Four --
			three -- two -- one -- energize.
			Did you get them off?
			No. They stayed on the freighter
			-- and sent their cargo.
			Cargo!? Are those people crazy?
			What could possibly be that
			important?
			Sir -- the freighter is
			disintegrating.
			Captain, the freighter is entering
			the atmosphere. Her hull
			temperature is building.
			Number One -- I don't understand
			these people. Their lives are
			in danger and they're sending over
			cargo?
			Unbelievable.
			We're losing the freighter.
			You've got to beam those people
			over now.
			Clear that cargo. Beam it to a
			hold.
			Aye, sir.
			Freighter Sanction... this is the
			Enterprise, get on the transporter
			pad and...
			Forget it. Just lock on to any
			life forms you can find and get
			them over.
			Trying, sir.
			The freighter is going down.
			Transporter Room! You're out of
			time.
			Reading six life forms...
			But I can't get a solid lock.
			We've no choice. Energize.
			You said SIX - where are...
			... the other two?
			The lock didn't hold, sir.
			Re-establish.
			It's too late.
			Number One!?
			Two are lost, sir. But we saved
			four.
			I am Commander William Riker of
			the USS Enterprise.
			I'm sorry. We were unable to
			rescue the other two.
			Were they with you...
			... or with you?
			With us.
			We did everything we could, if
			you had come instead of the cargo,
			you could have all made it.
			The cargo... Where is it?
			You did save it, didn't you?
			Yes, we did. It's in one of our
			cargo holds. You act like it's
			more important than your comrades.
			May we see it?
			Thank you. It's just we thought
			we had lost it.
			Careful with your choice of words,
			T'Jon. It's ours, not yours.
			We paid a fair price for it!
			You offered a fair price, but we
			have not received it.
			You accepted our goods in trade!
			Then where are they? Tell me!
			That's not our problem!
			No more than the barrel is your
			property. It's as simple as this.
			The goods were never delivered;
			they were destroyed with your
			ship.
			Hence the deal was incomplete;
			hence possession of the Felicium
			remains ours!
			We need it.
			Commander, I request you transport
			my associate --
			-- and myself down to our planet,
			with our merchandise.
			Yes, get them out of here! But
			the barrel stays.
			There's no reasoning with you.
			Langor, you expect too much from
			them. You always have and you
			are always disappointed.
			You didn't pay -- so it's not
			yours.
			Damn you, Sobi --
			Stop this! Now!
			Security to Cargo Bay Eleven!
			Behave yourselves, Gentlemen.
			Escort our "visitors" to the
			Observation Lounge.
			A natural electrical charge... ?
			Formidable.
			Yes, and a difficult weapon to
			confiscate.
			We have to resolve this. There
			isn't much time.
			What can you offer?
			Everything we had went down with
			the Sanction.
			Then it is going to be difficult
			to accommodate you.
			Solar flares are increasing in
			magnitude, sir. Deflectors are
			shaky, but holding.
			Maintain.
			And our rather combative guests,
			Number One?
			Waiting for you in the
			Observation Lounge, sir.
			Data, what can you tell me about
			the inhabitants of this system?
			Not very much, sir. The only
			recorded contact with the Delos
			system was over two hundred years
			ago. A scout ship reported two
			inhabited planets, both
			technologically just on the edge
			of acquiring space travel.
			Odd that in two centuries, neither
			civilization advanced further.
			Sir, I find it strange that none
			of our visitors feel much remorse
			about the two freighter passengers
			who perished... yet their barrel
			of cargo is a source of great
			anxiety to them.
			Yes, let us pay a call and get
			some answers. Counselor, Number
			One, Mister Data...
			Captain, may I present Sobi and
			Langor from the planet Brekka,
			which we are now orbiting. And
			T'Jon and Romas... from the
			neighboring planet, Ornara.
			I am sorry we could not save your
			ship.
			You could have repaired it.
			Yes.
			We have only two left. Neither
			works. They are critical to our
			survival. Could you fix them?
			Mister Data?
			Our computer downloaded the
			specifications for the magnetic
			coils the freighters depend on,
			sir. Assuming the malfunction
			is similar... suitable
			replacements can be fabricated.
			Instruct Engineering to proceed.
			Aye, sir.
			Now, as for our cargo...
			Our cargo, Captain.
			Wrong, Sobi --
			My first officer has said
			ownership of the cargo is in
			dispute. This is a question which
			must be settled by whatever legal
			mechanisms exist between your
			societies.
			Captain Picard, you don't
			understand. This is a matter of
			life and death.
			Why is that? What is the cargo?
			Medicine.
			Indeed.
			Our home planet is in desperate
			need, Captain. Ornara suffers
			from a lethal plague.
			The cargo you have impounded
			represents the only hope of life
			for our people.
			Is that right?
			Yes.
			You must think us heartless
			brutes, Captain, but look at our
			side of it. The plant which
			yields the medicine Felicium grows
			only in remote areas of our home
			planet Brekka.
			It must be painstakingly
			cultivated, harvested, and
			purified... a complex and
			expensive process.
			That single shipment of Felicium
			represents an enormous investment.
			We can't just give it away!
			We paid for it.
			We are asking only for what is
			ours.
			That is your viewpoint. Ours,
			of course, differs.
			You are going to hold to that
			position.
			I am constrained to abide by the
			terms of our agreement.
			Then you condemn us to death!
			Romas --
			You disgust me! If you saw the
			suffering the plague has brought,
			would you still be so heartless?
			We are going to get to find out,
			when you see what the plague does
			to us.
			Romas -- you and T'Jon carry the
			disease?
			Yes. Every Ornaran does.
			Then you may have brought it
			aboard my ship!
			Was there a medical scan during
			transport?
			Unverified -- the solar flares may
			have caused a malfunction in the
			biofilters --
			Red Alert! Medical emergency --
			decks twelve and thirteen. Doctor
			Crusher to the Observation Lounge
			immediately!
			You find us well, I trust?
			As far as I can tell. Your
			physiology is somewhat different
			but I detect no dangerous virus
			or bacteria.
			I assure you we are in perfect
			health.
			We're not! We need our medicine.
			Our medicine.
			We paid for it -- it's ours now!
			Enough!
			Of course you are right, Doctor.
			Could we leave now?
			I see no reason why not.
			Escort them to their quarters.
			Captain, could I talk with you
			please... in private.
			Not right now.
			What have you learned?
			The Brekkians are free of
			infection. The Ornarans have all
			the symptoms of a disease -- but
			I can't find a cause.
			Perhaps the transporter filtered
			it out when they were beamed
			aboard?
			There's no record of it. Then
			again, the solar flare activity
			may have caused a transporter
			malfunction.
			Are they going to die?
			The physiology is somewhat
			different from ours, so I need
			to check further, but... my
			instinct says no.
			Do you think we are in danger from
			this plague?
			Again, I don't think so, but I
			need more time to know for sure.
			There are some missing pieces to
			the puzzle, don't you feel that
			too?
			What's missing here is a little
			humanity.
			Are we losing our professional
			detachment, Doctor?
			Perhaps. As Captain, I think you
			should know that I am developing
			a very active dislike of the
			Brekkians.
			Understandable.
			Captain, you must give us back
			our cargo.
			I can't do that.
			Why not? It belongs to us.
			And the Brekkians insist it is
			theirs.
			They lie!
			Maybe so, but it's not for me to
			decide.
			We need some now... NOW! I don't
			care if it's your 'decision' or
			not... get us some!
			Captain, what's happening to us,
			is happening to thousands more
			on Ornara. Please understand the
			magnitude of the problem.
			Your people don't need it --
			-- they don't need it... our
			people do!
			If you don't give it to us, you
			will be party to murder... not
			only us, but an entire
			civilization!
			Sorry, I did not mean to insult
			you. I'm feeling very shaky.
			We cannot hold out much longer!
			No, Captain -- I think they should
			have it. They believe it will
			help them. That in itself might
			control their symptoms.
			I'll talk with the Brekkians.
			Thank you, Captain. I appreciate
			anything you can do.
			May I say, Captain, how impressed
			we are with your ship and its
			facilities.
			Thank you.
			And its crew. Everyone is so
			efficient and professional.
			I am glad you are comfortable.
			I've come to seek your agreement
			to an Ornaran request.
			We cannot --
			Wait. Let the Captain speak.
			We want to be reasonable.
			The Ornarans are quite ill and
			are insistent that they need
			Felicium.
			That is not surprising.
			Then would you object to allowing
			them enough Felicium for their
			immediate needs?
			Captain, we Brekkians are in
			business -- we are not in the
			habit of giving away what has not
			been paid for.
			You would let them die rather than
			share the medicine?
			We want to be fair, Captain. We
			agree to permitting them two
			dosages for immediate use.
			No charge.
			I'll have our medical officer
			handle it.
			I trust you won't mind if we are
			present while you open the cargo,
			Captain.
			Point-zero-one milliliters is the
			proper individual dosage.
			A very potent substance.
			We've perfected our distillation
			process over the years. In my
			grandfather's day, the same amount
			of Felicium would have filled five
			rooms this size, Captain.
			No doubt you have applied your
			technology from other industries
			to the refinement of this product.
			We have no other industry.
			None at all?
			We don't need any. The Ornarans
			provide us everything we need --
			in exchange for this.
			Fascinating. Your society
			dedicated exclusively to the
			production of a single product.
			A product for which you have no
			use for, but which the Ornarans
			can't live without.
			One of the little ironies of life,
			Captain.
			But one we'd be fools not to take
			advantage of. It is mutually
			beneficial.
			The Ornarans provide us with the
			necessities of life and we provide
			them with the necessities of
			living. It is a fair exchange.
			A most interesting relationship.
			Excuse me... I'll take this to
			Sickbay.
			Can I help?
			No.
			Hurry up!
			You are feeling better?
			Yes. Thank you. I'm fine now.
			Report, Doctor Crusher.
			I may not know Felicium's full
			effect on Ornaran physiology.
			But I know how to interpret
			physical reactions.
			Are the Ornarans recovering?
			Both T'Jon and Romas are fine...
			in fact, too fine.
			Felicium is a narcotic.
			Then T'Jon, Romas -- indeed every
			Ornaran --
			-- is a drug addict.
			It's a fascinating little tale
			we've run into of disease -- rescue
			-- commerce -- and interdependence
			between two worlds.
			You have piqued my interest,
			Number One -- please continue.
			Mister Data.
			Beginning several thousand years
			ago, the two worlds took different
			paths. Ornara became technically
			sophisticated, Brekka did not.
			Then two hundred years ago Ornara
			was stricken by a devastating
			plague.
			Their advanced technology could
			offer no solution.
			Somehow, and there is limited
			information on this point, the
			cure was found in a plant which
			is indigenous to only Brekka, and
			which resisted all attempts at
			cultivation on Ornara.
			In any case a trading situation
			quickly developed, which still
			exists.
			The Ornarans acquire the Felicium
			from the Brekkians, and in
			exchange, the Ornarans provide
			the Brekkians with foods and
			staples.
			A nice arrangement for the
			Brekkians.
			And for the Ornarans -- without
			the medicine they would all die.
			No they wouldn't. Captain, here
			are the results of my analysis.
			Felicium is definitely a powerful
			and addictive narcotic. What's
			more, despite what the Ornarans
			have been saying, it's not a
			medicine. It was a medicine, and
			it did cure the plague, two
			hundred years ago.
			And they no longer need it.
			The plague is irrelevant now: it
			doesn't exist... and it's not
			going to recur.
			The Ornarans have no medical need
			for Felicium.
			No, but their physical and
			psychological need is very real.
			What are you going to do?
			Based on what we know so far...
			there is nothing I can do.
			And you don't think drug addiction
			and exploitation is sufficient
			cause?
			This situation has existed for
			a very long time. Those two
			societies are intertwined in a
			symbiotic relationship.
			With one society profiting at the
			expense of the other.
			That's how you see it.
			I can synthesize a non-addictive
			substitute which will ease their
			withdrawal symptoms.
			No. We can't do that either.
			I know this. You can't let them
			have the Felicium.
			Why? Because it goes against our
			moral sensibilities? Our mission
			is not to force Federation or
			Earth values on others in the
			galaxy.
			In this case... you're wrong,
			Captain. One hundred percent
			wrong.
			Captain, I am receiving a call
			from Ornara.
			Patch it in here.
			The signal's ragged, but I think
			I can put it on the Viewscreen.
			I am Margan. Are my people on
			board your ship?
			Some of them, yes.
			May I speak with them?
			Yes.
			Lieutenant Yar, have the Ornarans
			brought in... no, wait, I don't
			want them to have access to the
			bridge.
			We will contact you in a few
			minutes.
			I will take this in the guest
			quarters.
			I can understand how this could
			happen to the Ornarans... What
			I can't understand is why anyone
			would voluntarily become dependent
			upon a chemical.
			Yet, the voluntary addiction to
			drugs is a recurrent theme in many
			cultures.
			As in the twenty-first century...
			when Earth governments used
			narcotics to control the military.
			Or look at the twentieth century.
			The dangers of drug abuse were
			well known, yet their use was
			commonplace.
			Why?
			That is what I do not understand.
			No one wants to become dependent.
			That happens later.
			But it does happen. So why do
			people even start?
			Oh, lots of reasons... My home
			planet was a place of great
			poverty and violence. For some,
			the only escape was through drugs.
			I fail to comprehend how a
			chemical substance can provide
			an escape.
			It doesn't. But it makes you
			think it does.
			You have to understand -- drugs
			can make you feel good.
			They put you on top of the world.
			You're happy... Sure of yourself.
			In control. A lot of people never
			feel that otherwise.
			But it is artificial.
			It doesn't feel artificial. It
			feels natural, good, and mind
			expanding.
			Until the drug wears off. Then
			you pay the price. Once you come
			down, you're lower than when you
			started. So you take the drug
			again -- and it kicks you back
			up. But not as high this time.
			So you take more.
			But each peak gets lower and
			the valleys get deeper. Before
			you know it -- you're taking the
			drug not to feel good but to keep
			from feeling bad.
			And that's the trap.
			You think the drug expands your
			universe -- but it actually
			shrinks it. Shrinks it to where
			you and the drug are all that's
			left.
			Pretty soon, all you care about
			is getting your next dosage.
			You'll lie, cheat, steal --
			anything to get that fix.
			Certainly by then you would
			realize the danger.
			That's the worst of it. You don't
			care. The drug is your salvation
			-- your survival. Nothing else
			is important.
			I guess I just don't understand.
			Wesley, I hope you never do.
			Lieutenant Yar, we are ready in
			the guest quarters.
			T'Jon. Have you got it?
			Well, it's here, but...
			You've got to get it to us.
			T'Jon... please... We're dying
			here. You don't know... this is
			the worst it's ever been.
			I'm doing everything I can.
			See... what happened was...
			Stop. I can't listen. T'Jon...
			we need the medicine. So, many
			people... so much suffering.
			You've got to get it to us. I
			can't... I can't go on. Help,
			T'Jon... please.
			I'm sorry.
			Take us to our planet - leave us
			there with our medicine or this
			person dies.
			Don't you see -- I have no choice.
			We were sent to bring back the
			Felicium. The suffering on my
			planet is too great. People are
			dying. It doesn't matter any more
			whether we are entitled to the
			Felicium... we have to have it.
			Let him go.
			Take us there now -- or give us
			a shuttle -- but we must have the
			medicine... if you refuse, this
			person dies.
			I will not be coerced.
			I'll do it. I'll kill him.
			No you won't. You're not a killer
			and neither am I.
			Help us... please... help us.
			I'm not sure that I can.
			Captain Picard, we couldn't help
			overhearing. Could I see you for
			a moment?
			Come with me, Doctor. This could
			be interesting.
			We have thought about this a great
			deal.
			Both of us feel deeply about what
			is happening on Ornara.
			Although this is going to cause
			hardship to us and to our people,
			we have decided to give the
			Felicium to them.
			They can pay for it when they are
			able.
			We don't want to cause any
			suffering.
			I wonder why I expected this.
			Pardon?
			It's the other shoe.
			The Ornarans are not aware, are
			they?
			Of what?
			That the plague which nearly
			destroyed Ornara... infected your
			world as well.
			You don't know that for sure.
			It had to.
			But somehow, one of your ancestors
			realized that your desire for the
			drug continued after the disease
			had been cured. They made the
			connection and were able to end
			their addiction.
			But these same wonderful people
			also realized that their neighbors
			never found out. Their need for
			the drug grew to the point it is
			now. Your sole source of support
			comes from providing the narcotic.
			And the refinement process of
			which you are so proud was a way
			to make Felicium even more
			addicting... and tighten your
			grip on the Ornarans even further.
			Are you going to tell them?
			No. I can't tell them. You see,
			I am bound by the rules of the
			United Federation of Planets,
			which say I am not to interfere
			in other worlds, other cultures.
			To tell them any of this would
			be interfering and would violate
			the Prime Directive.
			You're talking to us about it...
			Telling you things you already
			know... which changes nothing.
			Jean-Luc. I can synthesize
			something which will alleviate
			their suffering and make
			withdrawal painless.
			That won't be necessary, because
			if I understand the captain, he
			is going to allow the Ornarans
			to have the Felicium.
			Yes, I am.
			You can't do that. Some things
			go beyond words on a page. These
			Brekkians have knowingly enslaved
			others. They have caused untold
			suffering and hardship, just so
			their pitiful lives could be
			easier. At least don't give the
			Ornarans more drugs.
			It is not for me to make any of
			these decisions.
			You are absolutely right, Captain.
			Captain, we've arrived at Ornara
			and assumed standard orbit.
			Acknowledged. Thank you.
			Forgive me for doing what I must.
			I'm beaming you down to your
			world... with your Felicium.
			Good. I knew it would work out
			this way.
			You've made the only humanitarian
			decision, Captain.
			Langor and I will beam down to
			Ornara with you.
			We'll work out payment terms for
			the Felicium.
			On behalf of my people, I extend
			thanks for your benevolent
			attitude.
			And I also thank you, Captain,
			for doing the right thing.
			Your gift of these coils will
			ensure that our freighters will
			continue to work.
			No.
			No.
			I will not supply you with spare
			parts for your freighters. If
			you want them repaired, you'll
			have to do that yourself.
			In a short time our freighters
			will be inoperable.
			Quite possibly.
			But we depend on those freighters!
			We must have those parts.
			If you withhold those coils,
			you're disrupting the stability
			of both our planets --
			-- and interfering with a trade
			arrangement that has lasted for
			generations! What of this Prime
			Directive of yours?
			Nothing in the Prime Directive
			compels me to help you.
			You're an executioner, Captain.
			You want our world to perish.
			No. That's not what I want.
			But without our freighters, there
			will be no more shipments of
			Felicium! We will die!
			You must trust in yourselves.
			There are... other options.
			And you must understand that my
			oath as a Starfleet officer gives
			me no choice in the matter.
			Transporter Room. Lock onto our
			guests and their cargo and beam
			them down to Ornara.
			Captain, I hope you realize what
			you've done to us.
			Of that, you can be sure.
			Good luck.
			When the Felicium runs out, the
			people of Ornara will suffer
			horrible withdrawal pains.
			No doubt.
			We could have made their burden
			easier.
			Only in the short run. Painful
			as it will be, the people of
			Ornara -- and the people of Brekka
			-- must shape their own destinies.
			It sounds so... heartless.
			Doctor, it was not an easy
			decision.
			I just hope it was the right one.
			Mister LaForge, take us out of
			orbit.
			Aye, sir. Course laid in.
			Engage.
