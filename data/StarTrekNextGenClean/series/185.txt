Second Officer's Personal Log:
Stardate 44390.1 Record entry
for transmission to Commander
Bruce Maddox, Cybernetics
Division, Daystrom Institute.
Dear Commander Maddox,...
In reference to your most recent
letter, I agree that your study
lacks sufficient primary source
information on my programming.
Therefore in response to your
request, this correspondence will
include a complete record of my
activities during a normal day,
focusing on my perceptions of
friendship.
Good morning, Commander. You are
fifteen minutes early.
Well, it's a special day. I
thought the... father of the bride
would enjoy being relieved a
little early on the wedding day.
Thank you, sir.
Nervous?
I cannot become nervous. However,
I do sense a certain...
anticipation regarding my role
in the wedding.
All systems normal, sir. Sickbay
reported that Lieutenant Juarez
went into labor at zero four
hundred hours. We remain on
station awaiting the arrival of
the starship Zhukov and guest
quarters have been prepared for
Ambassador T'Pel.
Very well. I have the Bridge.
Aye, sir.
Begin day watch.
Initially Commander Maddox, I
found it difficult to maintain
friendships since human emotions
are often puzzling to me.
Eventually, I developed a program
enabling me to predict human
emotional responses to specific
actions.
Come in.
It is time for the wedding
rehearsal.
I know...
I've decided not to go through
with it, Data.
You do not wish to rehearse?
No, I'm... calling off the
wedding.
May I ask why?
It's just the right thing to do.
Have your feelings for Chief
O'Brien changed?
I'm supposed to be getting
married, Data. I should be
happy... but I'm not. I just feel
this weight pressing down on me.
Will cancelling the wedding make
you happy?
Yes.
He'll probably be just as relieved
as I am.
Data, you introduced us, you mean
a lot to both of us... I'd really
appreciate it if... you would tell
Miles for me.
If you wish.
I have often heard my friend Chief
O'Brien say that above all else,
he wants to make Keiko happy.
Since cancelling the wedding will
make her happy, I must conclude
the Chief will be pleased at her
decision.
I have good news.
Oh?
Yes. Keiko has made a decision
designed to increase her
happiness.
She has cancelled the wedding.
She what?
Cancelled the wedding? Today?
Without even a word... of all the
childish, selfish... !
Next time, maybe I should break
the... good news.
Commander Maddox, it would appear
that my program designed to
predict emotional responses
needs... adjustment.
Personal Log: Supplemental. This
is the one thousand five hundred
fiftieth day since the Enterprise
was commissioned.
Besides the arrival of Ambassador
T'Pel, other events occurring
today include four birthdays,
two personnel transfers, a
celebration of the Hindu Festival
of Lights, two chess tournaments,
one secondary school play, and
four promotions.
Overall... an ordinary day.
The Zhukov is ready for transport,
sir.
Energize.
Welcome aboard the Enterprise,
Ambassador.
I would meet with your Captain.
Unlike my human friends, I am not
affected by feelings or emotional
considerations. In that sense,
I am closer to being Vulcan than
human, but I am not attracted to
Vulcan philosophy. Their devotion
to logic does have a certain
appeal in its simple purity...
... but I find theirs to be a
somewhat... stark philosophy,
lacking beauty... and joy.
Ambassador T'Pel...
I come to serve.
Your service honors us.
My first officer, Commander
William Riker.
Leave us, please.
Charming woman.
The tone of Commander Riker's
voice makes me suspect that he
is not serious about finding
Ambassador T'Pel charming. My
experience suggests that in fact
he may mean the exact opposite
of what he says. This is a form
of expression I have not yet been
able to master.
You don't need a haircut. You
were just in here last week.
Hey, I wouldn't be back here so
soon if you'd done it right the
first time...
When I have difficulty
understanding human behavior I
often turn to Commander Geordi
LaForge. I consider him to be...
my best friend.
I know you want to be beautiful...
I'm just a barber, not a miracle
worker.
Just try to keep my ears on
straight today, all right?
Friendly insults and jibes...
another form of human speech
that I am attempting to master.
Hi... here for a trim?
My hair does not require
trimming... you peabrain.
What?
My hair...
'Peabrain'?
I am experimenting with friendly
insults and jibes. It was not
meant as a serious disparagement.
Well... I wouldn't try it out on
the Captain.
Geordi, I am still confused about
Chief O'Brien's reaction this
morning.
He was just surprised, Data. He
didn't mean to blow up like that.
He knows Keiko probably doesn't
want to call off the marriage.
She's just getting cold feet.
Cold feet... jitters... a nervous
reaction to an impending event
of great importance.
Right. Don't worry,
everything'll be fine. She'll
change her mind again.
She will?
Absolutely.
Then you believe the wedding will
still proceed?
Trust me, they'll get married...
so you better find a gift.
I find Lieutenant Worf to be what
is called a kindred spirit. We
were both orphans and were both
rescued by Starfleet officers.
In many ways, we are both still
outsiders in Human society. I
do not fully understand why, but
I find it... comforting to think
that I am not alone in that
regard.
Are you here to find a wedding
gift?
Yes.
I would appreciate your help in
selecting an appropriate item.
Of course. I have attended human
weddings before.
This is a traditional gift?
My adoptive parents often give
these... things at family
weddings. A human custom.
It was my understanding that the
item selected should reflect the
personality of whoever is giving
the gift.
This does not remind me of you.
Have you ever been an actual
participant in a human wedding?
No.
You would not consider it to be
an honor?
An honor, perhaps. But human
bonding rituals involve a great
deal of talking, dancing, and
crying.
Dancing...
Continue to monitor the
contractions. I'd say she still
has a couple hours to go.
You're going to be just fine.
I am rarely in need of Doctor
Beverly Crusher's professional
services as my biomechanical
maintenance program (tech) is
self-sufficient. But I often
observe as she practices medicine
on others and have learned a
great deal about the human
condition from her.
Doctor, may I ask a favor of you?
Of course.
Will you teach me how to dance?
What?
I would like to learn how to
dance.
Why me?
It is in your service record.
'Awarded first prize in tap and
jazz competition, Saint Louis
Academy---
Okay, okay.
Have I said something to upset
you?
It's just... that was a long time
ago.
I'd rather not be known as... as
the dancing doctor. Again.
Then your answer is no?
All right. But let's keep this
between us.
Of course, Doctor.
Commander Data, please report to
the Bridge.
Acknowledged.
Mister Data... I need a tactical
projection of possible future
Romulan deployments along the
Neutral Zone. Access all
Federation records on the subject
and then report to my Ready Room.
That is a very general request,
Captain. Is there a more specific
area you wish me to study?
No.
Set course one-three-zero mark
two-four-six. Warp seven.
That course will take us very
close to the Neutral Zone,
Captain.
I'm aware of that. Proceed.
Lay in the course.
It is fortunate that I am able
to perform my duties without
emotional distractions. If that
were not the case, a sudden course
correction toward the Neutral Zone
would make me very... nervous.
Personal Log: Supplemental.
Commander Maddox, there are still
many dynamics of social
interaction which I do not
understand.
The belief among humans that a
captain must remain distant from
his crew is puzzling. Captain
Picard and I have worked together
closely for over three years...
Come.
... and yet I cannot truthfully
refer to him as my friend. I find
that thought to be...
disappointing.
Based on your analysis, what is
the current Romulan strategy
behind the deployment of their
ships in this sector?
Their ships are deployed to
support a policy of confrontation
designed to test Federation
defenses along the Neutral Zone.
Do you predict any change in the
near future?
I project a ninety percent
probability that they will
continue to pursue this policy.
Are there any indications of a
more conciliatory attitude on
their part?
No, sir.
Caution is clearly called for,
Captain. However, the mission
must proceed as planned.
Starfleet Command agrees with you,
Ambassador. But I would feel
better if you would consent to
an escort or...
Thank you, Mister Data.
Feline supplement seventy-four.
Computer, run fluidic sensor
diagnostic.
Diagnostic complete. All systems
functioning within normal
parameters.
Come in.
Am I intruding, Commander?
No.
Would you care to sit down?
When one of my friends is
distraught, I know that I should
attempt to make him more
comfortable.
May I offer you some refreshment,
chief?
No, thank you, sir. First of
all... I'd like to apologize for
this morning in Ten Forward...
There is no need to apologize.
I was not offended.
Perhaps you would like a pillow
or a more comfortable chair to
sit upon.
Uh... no sir. Thank you, sir.
Would you care to listen to music?
Brahms? Aurelia? Mexler?
No, sir... really... I'm fine.
I came here to... to ask for your
help.
It's about Keiko... I'd like you
to talk to her... convince her
to go through with the wedding.
Would Counselor Troi not be a more
appropriate choice to speak with
Keiko?
She already has... it didn't
help.
You've known her longer than I
have... I just thought she might
listen to you.
She won't even talk to me...
I do not know what to say to her.
Just talk with her... try to make
her see reason. She's going off
half-cocked and not thinking this
through. You've worked with her
for a long time... she respects
your opinion.
Perhaps she has not fully analyzed
her decision.
Thank you, sir. I won't forget
this.
Commander Maddox, I noted that
Keiko was quite calm and rational
when she informed me of her
decision this morning.
Therefore, I can predict that
she will respond to an objective
analysis of the situation based
on the available facts.
It is fortunate that she has not
let emotional considerations cloud
her judgement. It should make
my task much simpler.
Hi.
Am I disturbing you?
No...
There is a high likelihood that
your decision to cancel the
wedding was an error.
What?
I believe you made an incorrect
analysis of the facts at hand.
What do you mean?
You do not seem happy.
Well, no...
Your decision was based on the
assumption that cancelling the
wedding would bring you happiness.
That has proved to be incorrect.
Data... it's not that simple.
Since your action did not produce
the desired results, the most
advisable solution is to
re-examine the decision-making
process and look for errors.
I knew what I was doing. It's
my decision.
That fact is not in dispute.
However, you may have acted with
undue haste... and in doing so,
you have unintentionally hurt
Chief O'Brien's feelings.
I did what I had to! Why are you
doing this? I thought you were
my friend.
I am your friend.
Then leave me alone.
If I have offended---
Just... leave me alone.
It is clear that I need guidance
to resolve this situation.
Counselor Troi's advice should
be useful.
In many ways, she is the friend
that I understand the least. Her
life and her duties are predicated
on her understanding and
perception of emotions. Since
I have none, no doubt she finds
me as much of a mystery as I find
her.
Chief O'Brien talks to me... Keiko
talks to you... why do they not
talk to each other?
That's a good question, Data.
I wish I had a good answer for
you. Perhaps when they're ready,
they will.
Many aspects of this situation
are puzzling. I have been
studying relevant texts on the
subject of marriage, but I have
not found a suitable guide.
A suitable guide for what?
In an effort to be helpful, I
am trying to calculate the
variables involved in a successful
marriage.
Good luck.
There are many different
opinions. On Galvin Five, a
marriage is considered successful
only if children are produced
within a year of the wedding.
Andorian marriages require groups
of four people unless two---
Data... would you like my advice
on how to help them?
Don't. This is something they
need to work out for themselves
now.
But I am their friend. Should
I not stand with them in a time
of difficulty?
There are many ways of helping
a friend... sometimes the best
way is to leave them alone.
Do you believe marriage to be the
right decision for them?
I don't know. They are very much
in love, but sometimes that isn't
enough. Marriage is an agreement
to share who you are with someone
else... to spend your lives
together... to grow old together.
'To grow old together?' Is that
an integral component of
marriage?
Why do you ask?
Although I am an android, I have
not excluded the possibility that
I too may someday marry.
There's nothing wrong with that.
I believe I have much to offer
a potential mate, however we
cannot grow old together,
Counselor, because I will not grow
old.
You do have a lot to offer,
Data...
Commander Data, this is Ambassador
T'Pel. Please report to my
quarters.
Acknowledged.
Enter.
You have a priority three
clearance aboard the Enterprise?
That is correct, Ambassador.
I require information on this
ship's defense and navigational
systems. Access code kappa alpha
four-six-zero-one-seven-zero-four.
That code is valid.
What is the field strength of the
ship's deflector shields at
maximum output?
May I ask what is the purpose for
this request?
I require the information.
I have the same safeguards as the
ship's computer. Therefore, I
must report any inquiry regarding
restricted information to the
Captain along with a report
stating the nature and purpose
of the inquiry.
Your reaction suggests that you
do not wish the Captain to be
informed of your inquiry.
No. I was not interested in the
information. I was curious as
to your security safeguards.
They appear to be adequate.
Cancel request. You may leave.
Commander Maddox, I have often
wished for the sense that humans
call intuition or instinct.
Since Vulcans do not lie, I must
accept the Ambassador's
explanation... but I still wish
I could have a... gut feeling
to back up this conclusion.
Program Crusher Four in progress.
Hi.
Whatta ya think? It's a recreation
of the studio where I took my
first dance lesson.
It appears to be quite suitable,
Doctor.
All right, then. Let's start with
something real simple.
Go ahead, try it.
Good! Now try this...
Wait a minute...
Try it again, but watch my
arms...
And... you say you're never done
this... ?!
That is correct. Perhaps it would
be beneficial to show me the final
lesson.
Okay...
That was the easiest lesson I've
ever given.
Then I have succeeded in learning
how to dance?
You seem to have... picked up the
basics.
Thank you, Doctor. I am now ready
to dance at the wedding.
Wedding?
Keiko's wedding.
But you never... you didn't say
it was for the wedding.
Is that important?
Well... yes. They don't do a
lot of tap dancing at weddings...
Why not?
Because... well... actually I'm
not exactly sure, Data. But we'd
better try a style of dancing
they will do at the wedding...
Computer, run "Blue Moon".
Compared to what we were just
doing, it's very simple. Just
follow me. One, two, three,
four---
No, no... you're trying to---Ow!
Move more slowly... that's it...
no, now you're--Ow! Stop music.
I am sorry.
I don't get it... you picked up
tap dancing so quickly...
I cannot reproduce your
performance if I cannot see your
feet.
You need something to copy. You
can't just... dance?
No, Doctor.
All right... this time, watch my
feet. Computer, start music.
Don't try to imitate me. You
have to lead.
Lead where?
Indicate to your partner where
you're going to step.
How is this accomplished... ?
Watch me, I'll lead...
Notice I don't repeat the same
pattern over and over... I
improvise... Good... Now you
lead...
Look up... into my eyes...
Good... You're holding me too
tight, Data...
This is a very complex set of
variables to coordinate.
You're doing fine... now smile,
like you're enjoying yourself...
Doctor Crusher please report to
Sickbay.
Is it Lieutenant Juarez?
Yes, Doctor. Her contractions
are now one minute apart.
I'm on my way.
Why don't you try it with an...
artificial partner for a little
while? Don't be afraid to
experiment.
I will. Thank you, Doctor.
Computer, create dance partner,
female.
Begin music.
... he still won't talk... so they
put the Count's head on the
chopping block... 'one more
chance' says the Queen. 'No' says
the Count. The headsman swings
his axe and just as the blade
falls, the Count says 'Wait, wait,
I'll talk!' but it was too late.
And the moral to the story is
don't hatchet your counts before
they chicken.
Commander Riker's easy-going
manner and sense of humor is
fascinating. It is one reason
why he is so popular among the
crew. I believe it may also be
partly responsible for his success
in matters of love. There may
be a possible correlation between
humor and sex... the need for more
research is indicated.
Commander, we have reached the
designated coordinates.
All stop.
Captain Picard to the Bridge.
Hold position. Long range scan.
I have detected a ship in the
Neutral Zone, Captain.
Configuration... Romulan Warbird.
Yellow Alert.
Mister Worf, hail the Warbird.
Aye, sir.
They are responding... text only
Captain.
We are to proceed to the agreed
coordinates.
Set course zero three seven mark
zero zero five, warp four. Take
us into the Neutral Zone, Ensign.
Captain, the Warbird is holding
position. In three minutes we
will be within phaser range.
Red Alert.
My crew knows their duty,
Ambassador. They will take no
provocative action... without my
order.
Hold position at these
coordinates.
Slow to half impulse.
Open a channel.
Open.
This is Ambassador T'Pel. I have
arrived.
I am Admiral Mendak.
There is no established protocol
for a meeting of this nature.
The logical course is for me to
transport aboard your ship and
begin the negotiations.
Yes...
Captain, I note your defensive
systems have been activated.
As are yours, Admiral.
It was not meant as an
accusation...
Indeed, I salute your show of
strength. Ambassador, we are
honored by your presence. You
may transport aboard at your
convenience.
The honor is mine.
Instruct your Transporter Room
to stand-by. I will beam to their
ship without further delay.
Ambassador, I must once again urge
you to reconsider. The Enterprise
can accommodate a Romulan
delegation without sacrificing
security or---
Captain Picard, I find your
arguments illogical. Please carry
out my instructions.
Bridge to Transporter Room Three.
O'Brien here.
Prepare to beam Ambassador T'Pel
to the Romulan ship.
Aye, sir.
Maintain a lock on her signal
once she's aboard their vessel.
At the first sign of trouble I
want to be able to bring her
back.
Understood.
Transporter activated...
Captain---!
Transporter emergency! I'm
losing her signal!
Boosting power to autosequencers.
Engaging computer override.
O'Brien what's happening down
there?
I'm losing the pattern... trying
to re-establish...
I'm sorry, sir... I wasn't able
to retrieve the signal... the
Ambassador's dead.
The signal lock wasn't broken,
sir. I had just entered the
transfer sequence when the
Ambassador's pattern began to
break up. I tried to go to
emergency manual control, but the
pattern deteriorated too rapidly
and...
Personal Log: Supplemental. The
risks aboard a starship are
accepted by all who serve, but
I have never failed to observe
a deep emotional response to the
loss of a comrade. It is at times
like this that I greatly miss the
ability to share human feelings.
Captain, there is no prior record
of this type of accident occurring
on a starship. Back-up systems
and safeguards are designed to
prevent just such an occurrence.
I can't find any system flaws in
the unit, sir. All the
Engineering status reports were
normal. None of the backups were
activated and the autosequencers
all functioned normally.
Any prior malfunctions with this
Transporter unit?
No, sir. In fact, we replaced
the transition coils only a week
ago.
Could there have been some kind
of interference from the Romulans?
Nothing that I could see... their
shields were down... there was
no power interruption... no
subspace bias.
I want that unit pulled and its
systems checked again. I also
want a level one diagnostic
performed on all Transporters.
Aye, Captain.
Her molecular structure
dissipated instantly once the
pattern was lost. There were a
few organic compounds left on the
pad, but there's not enough
material for an autopsy.
To die in a Transporter
accident... Hardly a fitting end
for one of the Federation's most
honored diplomats.
Bridge to Captain. Admiral Mendak
wishes to speak with you.
We're still waiting, Captain.
Is there a problem?
There's been... an accident.
Ambassador T'Pel... was killed
in a Transporter malfunction.
What kind of malfunction?
We're investigating that right
now. I'm sure that---
I should have known the Federation
wasn't serious about this
conference.
Admiral, I can assure you that
the Federation places the highest
priority on this mission and its
goal.
Well played, Captain... well
played. Starfleet opposes
normalization of relations with
the Romulan Empire and so you are
ordered to create... an accident.
You're mistaken. I am ready and
willing to discuss the
establishment of full diplomatic
relations under the same terms
as Ambassador T'Pel.
A generous offer, since you know
that we were only willing to
negotiate with T'Pel.
I salute you again, Captain. It
was a maneuver worthy of a
Romulan. I suggest we both leave
the Neutral Zone before there
is... another accident.
Set course for Federation
territory, warp two.
Engage.
Mister Data, take charge of the
investigation. Study computer
logs, sensor information...
everything. I refuse to believe
this was a simple malfunction.
Yes, sir.
Captain Picard was the person who
first interested me in the works
of Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle.
I have subsequently become a great
admirer of the fictional detective
Sherlock Holmes and his ability
to solve mysteries by careful
examination of the available
evidence.
I have found Holmes' methodology
of deductive reasoning to be quite
useful in performing my duties.
One of his adages is that once
you have eliminated the
impossible...
... whatever remains, however
improbable, must be the truth.
I'm afraid I can't give you
another lesson right now, Data.
That is not my purpose. I wish
to examine the remains of
Ambassador T'Pel found on the
Transporter pad.
I'm working on my report right now.
Have you compared the genetic
code with the Ambassador's last
recorded Transporter ID trace?
No... that's not part of the
standard procedure. Why?
I could be pursuing an untamed
ornithoid without cause.
A wild goose chase?
Okay... let's see what happens...
Computer, access Transporter ID
trace of Ambassador T'Pel.
All right... there's the genetic
record of the Ambassador when she
beamed aboard the Enterprise.
Now, the breakdown of the
organic material found on the
Transporter pad should be
identical.
Mitochondrial structure fits all
general parameters... no change
in the nucleotide bases...
There's a slight discrepancy in
the base pair sequence.
Chemically, these are identical...
however, the organic sample from
the Transporter is showing
numerous single-bit errors... like
replicated material.
Can you postulate an explanation
for the discrepancy?
I'd say the DNA was either mutated
by the Transporter during the
rematerialization process...
A supposition not supported by
the Transporter records.
Or these aren't the remains of
the Ambassador.
The only abnormality found during
my investigation was a temporary
increase in the matter to energy
signal ratio. This fluctuation
was well within operating
parameters and would normally not
invite further consideration.
However, due to the circumstances,
I decided to investigate the
possibility that a second
Transporter signal had caused the
fluctuation. Although this was
highly improbable, it was the only
remaining theory.
A second transporter signal?
From where?
From the Devoras.
Romulan transporters operate on
similar subspace frequencies to
our own. With minor adjustments
they could be made to simulate
our own transporter carrier wave.
So they beamed the Ambassador off
our own pad.
While simultaneously a small
amount of genetically similar
material was left in the
Ambassador's place.
To make us believe she died as
a result of the 'malfunction.'
Yes, sir.
Mister Worf, where is the Devoras?
The ship is still in the Neutral
Zone...
... on course zero seven nine mark
one two five... speed warp two.
Heading for home.
The safest and most logical
decision in this situation is to
contact Starfleet and await
further instructions. However,
based on past experience, I
project only a seventeen percent
chance Captain Picard will choose
that alternative.
Red Alert. All hands stand to
battlestations.
Lay in an intercept course to the
Romulan ship.
Shields up, load all torpedo bays,
stand-by phasers.
Course laid in, Captain.
Warp factor eight. Engage.
Open a channel to the Devoras.
Aye, sir.
No response.
The Devoras is dropping out of
warp... their weapon systems are
powering up.
Go to impulse power.
Aye, sir.
Message coming in, sir.
On screen.
Captain Picard, you agreed to
leave the Neutral Zone without---
Admiral Mendak, you are holding
our Ambassador captive.
I can assure you... there is no
one being held captive aboard this
ship.
We know about the Transporter
'malfunction' and that you are
holding Ambassador T'Pel.
Captain, Romulan Warbird
decloaking to starboard!
I suggest you leave... now.
It is my responsibility to protect
the lives of Federation citizens.
I will not permit this abduction
to succeed..
Captain, you're not going to start
an incident which might---
I am prepared to take whatever
action is necessary to obtain the
Ambassador's return.
In poker, there is a moment when
a player must decide if an
opponent is being deceptive or
actually holds a winning hand.
This decision is based not only
on the odds, but also on an
appraisal of the man. Is he
bluffing or does he have the
cards?
Fortunately... I'm not ready to
start a war today...
T'Pel?
Sub-Commander Selok, actually.
A spy.
A patriot, Captain... she has
performed her service to the
Empire with distinction.
Thank you for your... help,
Captain.
You can see now that we are not
holding one of your citizens...
and we thank you for returning
our sister to us.
But my patience has limits... the
game is over. I expect you to
leave peacefully. Now.
Sir, long-range scanners show
three more Romulan ships moving
into this sector.
Some days you get the bear, some
days the bear gets you.
Reverse course... take us back
to Federation territory, warp six.
Engage.
Captain Picard once drew an
analogy between life and a chess
game... he said that the loss of
a single piece does not concede
the game itself.
The Captain has also said that
out of the ashes of defeat rise
the victorious dreams of men.
I find that to be a worthy
philosophy and I have incorporated
it into my programming.
Keiko, I need your help.
I have offended you and need to
find a way to rectify my mistake.
I am not sure what to do.
You didn't offend me.
I should not have interfered.
It would be best if I apologized.
It would be best if you got
dressed.
For the wedding?
But...
Oh, come here... I have a
beautiful carnation for the
father of the bride... don't be
nervous now...
I am not nervous.
I am just... confused.
Since the time of the first wooden
sailing ships, all captains have
enjoyed the happy privilege of
joining two people in the bonds
of matrimony. And so now it is
my honor to unite you Keiko
Ishikawa, and you Miles Edward
O'Brien together in marriage here
in the sight of your friends and
family.
