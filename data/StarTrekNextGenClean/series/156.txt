			The truth is I'm a career man...
			you know, married to my job...
			Mitzi doesn't understand that...
			I like her a lot... but I just
			don't think I'm ready for two
			marriages if you know what I
			mean...
			But at the same time, you know
			I wouldn't want to lose her...
			Maybe you should come in with her
			and talk about it together.
			Oh, I couldn't ask her to do
			that...
			Sure you could. Why don't I make
			another appointment for you...
			Counselor Troi... ?
			Yes, Wesley...
			Can I talk to you a minute... I
			have a real problem with my
			mother.
			She's being completely
			unreasonable... see there's a
			party on Holodeck Four tonight...
			and all the other kids are staying
			overnight... well, most of them
			and...
			Computer, dispatches...
			A research inquiry from the
			Manitoba Journal of
			Interplanetary Psychology and
			three communiques from your
			mother...
			Transfer my mother's letters to
			my viewer...
			... and computer, I'd like a...
			a real chocolate sundae.
			Define "real" in context, please.
			Real... not one of your perfectly
			synthesized, ingeniously enhanced
			imitations... real chocolate ice
			cream, real whipped cream...
			This unit is programmed to provide
			sources of nutritional value.
			Your request does not fall within
			current guidelines.
			Listen, computer...
			Do you wish to override program?
			Picard to Counselor Troi.
			Now what?
			Yes, Captain?
			The pleasure of your company is
			requested, Counselor. We're
			having an impromptu reception for
			the arriving delegates.
			Captain, I'm not dressed for a
			reception...
			Oh, just throw on any old thing.
			We're about to get our first look
			at the wormhole.
			Of course, Captain. I'm on my
			way. Troi out.
			God forbid, I should miss the
			first look at the wormhole.
			May I escort you in, Miss Troi...
			Just tell me there's some
			chocolate here...
			Ah, Counselor Troi... allow me
			to do the introductions... Premier
			Bhavani of the Barzan...
			Your discovery has certainly
			produced a great deal of
			excitement, Premier.
			Hopefully, it will also produce
			a new era of prosperity for my
			people.
			We'll see to that...
			You know Mister Mendoza, the
			Federation negotiator...
			A pleasure to see you again,
			Counselor Troi.
			One of the Federation's worthy
			competitors in the bidding, Leyor
			of the Caldonians.
			Madame.
			And I am Devinoni Ral.
			Ship's Counselor Deanna Troi.
			My traveling companion, Rojay.
			My good friend, Ral, is the best
			hired gun in the business.
			Hired gun?
			My "good friend", Mendoza means
			that I am a negotiator who serves
			a variety of clients... on this
			occasion I represent the
			Chrysalians.
			I believe it's almost time, isn't
			it Captain?
			Indeed. It will be visible
			directly ahead...
			Is it always on time, Bhavani?
			Always. We see it every two
			hundred and thirty-three
			minutes... our scientists say it's
			due to radiation buildup in the
			acretion disk. The visible burst
			is very brief..
			There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
			The Barzan Wormhole. The first
			and only stable wormhole known
			to exist. It's yours... for the
			right price.
			Captain's log, Stardate 43385.7.
			We are in orbit around Barzan,
			a planet which is entertaining
			bids for control of
			what appears to be a most unique,
			stable wormhole. It could
			conceivably provide a permanent
			shortcut within our galaxy.
			And as you all know, the
			environment on my planet is
			completely inhospitable to most
			other life forms. So I'd like
			to express my appreciation to you,
			Captain Picard, and your fine crew
			for hosting these negotiations
			aboard the Enterprise.
			Remember, Mister Mendoza, it
			doesn't give the Federation an
			advantage.
			The Barzan has been a society
			dependent on others for
			generations. We want that to end.
			The appearance of this stable
			wormhole in our space provides
			us with our first true natural
			resource. We have neither the
			experience nor technology to
			exploit it. You do.
			Excuse me, a delegation of...
			Ferengi... wishes to be beamed
			aboard...
			You were not expecting the
			Ferengi, Premier... ?
			No, but I do not wish to create
			ill will, Captain. If they are
			interested in bidding, I have no
			objection.
			Chief O'Brien, this is Picard.
			Beam the Ferengi directly to the
			observation lounge.
			Aye, Captain...
			On behalf of all Ferengi, I
			protest... why were we not invited
			to these negotiations...
			My apologies. We did not
			anticipate your interest. You
			are welcome to join us.
			I am DaiMon Goss. These are my
			consuls... Kol and Doctor Arridor.
			We'll need chairs...
			DaiMon, I am Captain Jean-Luc
			Picard of the Enterprise... I'm
			serving as host for these
			proceedings...
			Good, then see to it that we get
			chairs at once.
			Perhaps you misunderstood...
			Fine, fine, just have your Klingon
			servant...
			I am in charge of security.
			Then who gets the chairs?
			DaiMon, due to the intimate nature
			of these negotiations, all parties
			agreed that one representative
			would suffice. I will be happy
			to provide your consuls with
			accommodations... and you may have
			my chair...
			Very well. Kol, the bag...
			We can handle all the pleasantries
			later. I'm sure I'll never
			remember your names anyway, eh?
			Enough of this foolishness. Let's
			get down to business.
			I'll match anyone's best offer...
			and add the gold on top of it.
			Computer... show me the file on
			delegate Devinoni Ral...
			Devinoni Ral, human, age forty-one,
			born Brussels, European
			Alliance, relocated at age nineteen
			to Hurkos Three, a non-aligned
			planet...
			Come in.
			Should I call for an
			appointment... ?
			No... I... was just looking over
			some personnel files...
			Too bad. I had hoped you might
			be thinking about... me.
			I thought you'd be deep into
			negotiations by now...
			In recess. I never play the
			opening rounds, anyway.
			Inconsequential.
			Besides there are more interesting
			things to negotiate on this ship.
			Like dinner tonight?
			What about your... traveling
			companion?
			My traveling companion... is
			traveling.
			I sent her home.
			Why?
			You know why.
			Weren't you getting along?
			Don't do that.
			What?
			Don't do "Counselor" Troi.
			Was I?
			When you leave this office, who
			are you?
			Oh. So that's how it is.
			You never do. You never leave
			the office.
			What are you...
			Ssshh...
			Dinner at eight?
			The data from the Barzan's probe
			into the wormhole is impressive,
			Captain. The wormhole delivered
			the probe beyond the Denkiri Arm,
			in the Gamma Quadrant.
			It would take us nearly a century
			at warp nine to cross that
			distance...
			The same distance could be
			achieved in a matter of seconds
			through the wormhole.
			I was just imagining the Ferengi
			collecting tolls in front if we
			lose to them...
			I don't think the Ferengi are the
			greatest threat at the table...
			with all of DaiMon Goss' bluster,
			they don't have the resources the
			Barzans need.
			I'd say that fellow Devinoni's
			the one to watch out for...
			An accurate observation... what
			made you recognize that?
			He's the most comfortable man in
			the group...
			You must play poker, Commander...
			Poker, isn't that a game of some
			sort?
			Commander Riker teaches poker.
			Our skills are not dissimilar,
			Commander.
			Mister Mendoza, if this lives up
			to its billing... it is a
			discovery of extraordinary
			value... but it is a big "if"...
			Wormholes are here one moment,
			gone the next... a stable wormhole
			is unheard of.
			Are you saying this may not be
			what it seems?
			The Barzans do not have manned
			space travel, so they had to
			resort to an automated probe.
			Its findings are limited. It
			cannot be determined from these
			charts how stable the wormhole
			really is or how long it will
			remain intact.
			The Federation could wind up
			"buying" itself the proverbial
			lemon, Mister Mendoza.
			And once the contract is
			negotiated and closed, we would
			be obliged to fulfill the terms.
			We really ought to see for
			ourselves.
			I don't think Bhavani could object
			to that...
			Geordi has continuous visual
			contact with the wormhole,
			Captain. He's the logical
			choice...
			I would also like to volunteer,
			Captain...
			Before anyone goes in there, we're
			going to conduct a full sensor
			analysis. I want to do everything
			possible to determine that it's
			safe.
			If we're satisfied, Data, you
			and Commander LaForge will enter
			the wormhole tommorrow.
			Just a moment of discomfort for
			a good cause, DaiMon.
			You understand this will not be
			lethal.
			Doctor, you surprise me. I have
			no wish to kill anyone. A short
			term crippling will suffice.
			Then, this will be just fine.
			A distillation of your own blood
			pyrocytes... harmless to you...
			undetectable by the ship's
			bio-filters... but when absorbed
			through your victim's skin, it
			will provoke an extreme allergic
			reaction.
			I'd say it is time to extend the
			hand of the Ferengi to the
			representative of the Federation.
			Much... better.
			Thank you. Come in for a drink?
			Ah, Federation decor...
			Not your style?
			Conformity is not my style.
			What would you like?
			I'd even like another.
			There she is again... Counselor
			Troi...
			I am not... computer, champagne...
			... for two...
			Am I moving too fast for you?
			No, I'm moving too fast for me.
			Mmm, I like that better...
			I haven't been able to stop
			thinking about you all day...
			You must've had a nice day.
			Anticipation is fun.
			We'll be late for dinner.
			Very late.
			Mister Mendoza?
			I seem to be a bit warm...
			I need some help here...
			You attempt to gain every unfair
			advantage, Picard...
			Premier Bhavani has no
			objection...
			Well, I most certainly do...
			First, you conveniently arrange
			to play host... now you plan to
			send your own manned probe into
			the wormhole... the Federation
			thinks it can do anything it wants
			to. And I will not tolerate it
			any longer...
			We will gladly share the results
			of our exploration with all the
			delegates...
			And you expect us to believe what
			you report?
			Then send in your own probe, Goss.
			That's exactly what I intend to
			do. And I strongly suggest you
			stay out of our way.
			Tell Data and LaForge to do
			themselves a favor and stay out
			of their way.
			Captain Picard, please come to
			Sickbay...
			Acknowledged, Doctor.
			Whatever he's got is obviously
			not life threatening -- it's some
			kind of system-wide histaminic
			reaction. He certainly can't go
			back to the negotiations for
			several days.
			Keep us advised.
			The Federation's top negotiator
			taken out by a mysterious ailment.
			Suspicions?
			With the Ferengi around, always.
			Well, I guess you'll have to fill
			in for him, Number One.
			Me?
			I am the designated host. It
			would be a most awkward
			transition. The next likely
			choice is you. Mister Mendoza
			would agree. He was quite
			impressed with your natural
			instincts.
			Excuse me, sir, but those weren't
			natural instincts... they're poker
			instincts... A parlor game
			doesn't exactly prepare me for
			this...
			Yes, the stakes are higher. But
			then... that's when the game gets
			interesting, doesn't it,
			Commander.
			The wormhole will reappear in
			thirty seconds.
			Shuttle nine, stand by...
			Ferengi pod is moving into
			position, Captain...
			Ferengi pod, this is Lieutenant
			Commander LaForge in the
			Enterprise shuttle.
			This is Doctor Arridor, go ahead.
			Would you care to take the point,
			Doctor?
			We will gladly yield that honor
			to you, Lieutenant Commander.
			Proceed when ready.
			Contact with the shuttle, sir.
			Pipe it in, Lieutenant.
			Captain, we have penetrated the
			outer event horizon of the
			wormhole. Sensors read severe
			doppler shifts...
			It's the relativistic time
			dilation, sir. Time is moving
			more slowly inside their part
			of the wormhole. I can process
			the audio to compensate...
			Make it so.
			... and intense energy fields which
			appear to be stabilizing the
			wormhole. It is not clear why...
			Now approaching the singularity...
			They've passed beyond our
			communication capabilities, sir...
			Commander, I appreciate what a
			difficult position this is for
			you. If you don't understand
			something, I hope you won't be
			embarrassed to ask me...
			I think I have an idea what the
			rules are.
			That's what makes it so
			interesting... the rules of the
			game change to fit the moment.
			In that regard, it's not unlike
			commanding a starship, Mister Ral.
			Commander, Mister Mendoza has
			already presented many of the
			details of the Federation
			proposal. Is there anything you
			would like to add?
			A complete analysis of our bid
			is available on the ship's
			computer for your consideration,
			Premier... If I may summarize...
			Our proposal includes technology
			that will enhance your food
			production, your mining
			capabilities, and space travel.
			We offer scholars and scientists
			to investigate the wormhole's
			potential. And perhaps most
			critical of all, we offer
			Starfleet. The security of this
			passage must never be compromised.
			We offer protection of the
			wormhole in perpetuity.
			Mister Ral... ?
			Mister Riker's placed a great deal
			of emphasis on defense... a
			subject he obviously knows well,
			having served Starfleet in many
			a conflict.
			The Chrysalians are enemies of no
			one... and choose to remain that
			way. Neutral.
			Neutral. And uninvolved, sir,
			in virtually all interstellar
			matters of consequence.
			No one would claim that the
			Chrysalians are as powerful as
			the mighty Federation, but we have
			resources and technology and
			scientists too. We have also had
			peace for ten generations.
			This is a fine proposal,
			Commander.
			I was just thinking...
			Mmmm?
			Maybe I could stretch out these
			negotiations a few extra days.
			Mmmm.
			Would you like that?
			Mmm-hmmm.
			Devinoni Ral, who are you?
			What do your Betazoid senses tell
			you about me?
			Not very much...
			My human physical response must
			be blocking them out.
			Good.
			It's never happened before.
			I rather like it that I'm more
			difficult to read than your other
			men...
			I don't have any others...
			currently.
			How about Commander Riker?
			Who have you been talking to... ?
			No one. I just sensed something
			when I saw the two of you
			together.
			Will Riker and I are good friends.
			Uh huh...
			It was once a little more than
			that.
			Mmmm-hmm...
			And how come we're talking about
			me and not you?
			Don't you have enough people
			telling you about their lives?
			Who counsels the counselor?
			Uh uh, I want to know about you
			now...
			I am a man of commerce. And I'm
			what you see right now. No games,
			no strategies. Just me, wanting
			to run away with you.
			And knowing that if I asked you,
			you'd never leave this damned
			ship.
			When I first saw you, I felt as
			if I'd been waiting for you. I've
			been trying to understand why or
			how that's possible.
			Does it matter?
			It will... when I tell you. But
			you must promise never to tell
			anyone else.
			What?
			I am partly Betazoid too.
			My mother was half... I am one
			quarter.
			You're empathic?
			The only one of five children.
			I must admit I was never as
			comfortable sensing emotions as
			you seem to be...
			That's why you left Earth...
			I've learned to live with it, use
			it... as you have... but still,
			it isolates us, doesn't it... ?
			I thought it would always be that
			way for me. Now, all of a sudden
			the rules I live by don't mean
			anything any more. I had tucked
			my heart away... didn't need it,
			didn't want it. At the
			negotiating table it can be fatal
			to have a heart... but I never
			realized how much I missed it
			until I looked at you.
			I'm picking up an increase in
			accretion matter filtering in from
			the terminus.
			We made it...
			Monitors are functioning normally
			again.
			Ferengi pod, everybody in one
			piece over there?
			Our condition is no concern of
			yours, Enterprise shuttle. We
			are competitors in this venture,
			not partners. Ferengi pod, out.
			Happy landings to you too.
			Curious.
			Huh?
			We are not where we are supposed
			to be.
			What do you mean... we're on the
			other side of the wormhole, aren't
			we... ?
			According to the Barzan probe,
			we should be in the Gamma
			Quadrant... but the readings
			clearly indicate we are nearly
			two hundred light years away.
			In sector three-five-five-six of
			the Delta Quadrant.
			Maybe the Barzan's readings were
			wrong...
			Maybe their readings were
			correct. Their probe could have
			exited the wormhole at a different
			location.
			Data, I'm picking up a subatomic
			fluctuation... meson and lepton
			activity is increasing...
			Gravitational acceleration is also
			increasing...
			Something very strange is
			happening to this wormhole.
			Sorry.
			You're unusually "limber" this
			morning.
			I'll say.
			Uh huh... ?
			Devinoni Ral.
			It's ridiculous. And wonderful.
			I feel... completely out of
			control. Happy. Terrified.
			There's nothing rational about
			this.
			Who needs rational when your toes
			curl up... ?
			I'm afraid I'm going to lose
			myself... I can't get enough of
			him. Is it possible to fall in
			love in one day?
			I did.
			It was like this for you and
			Jack?
			No, it was another fellow. Fell
			in love in a day. It lasted a
			week. But what a week.
			Then I met Jack... took months
			to figure it out with Jack.
			Maybe I should slow down... catch
			my breath, not let this get out
			of control...
			Nah.
			To be honest, I was surprised to
			see the Caldonians here at all,
			Leyor...
			You must think Caldonia very
			insular, Mister Ral.
			Not at all... on the contrary,
			I've respected your world's
			commitment to pure research. It's
			just that, well...
			Go ahead, please...
			Well, scholars don't always enjoy
			administrative demands...
			And certainly we've seen here that
			the administration of the
			wormhole...
			Yes... I must admit I have begun
			to feel some trepidation about
			that...
			I'm sure you have. I'm sure we
			all have, Leyor...
			Do you realize that during the
			next century, the number of
			ships...
			Gentlemen, this open session is
			called by request of the Caldonian
			delegation.
			Madame Bhavani, Caldonia withdraws
			from these proceedings.
			For what reasons, Leyor?
			It has been made very clear that
			the maintenance and administrative
			requirements are beyond our
			ability...
			Leyor, the Federation would like
			to negotiate a trade agreement
			to acquire your planet's rich
			deposits of Trillium 323 which
			we will add to our bid, Premier
			Bhavani...
			My apologies. We have already
			reached an agreement with the
			Chrysalians...
			Mister Ral, you either had very
			good instincts -- or foreknowledge
			of the Caldonian withdrawal.
			Some people just don't wish to
			transact business with the
			Federation, Commander.
			The Chrysalians hereby add the
			Caldonian Trillium 323 to its bid,
			Premier...
			I have no intention of leaving
			yet. We are not finished taking
			our readings...
			I'm telling you, it's changing...
			Look, your readings must be
			showing you the same things we're
			getting... this is not the Gamma
			Quadrant.
			I will not confirm your
			speculations...
			It is not a speculation, Doctor.
			We are not where the Barzans said
			we should be... which would
			indicate that this side of the
			wormhole is not stable.
			There are meson and lepton
			fluctuations... local
			gravitational fields are
			increasing exponentially...
			everything says we better get
			the hell out of here...
			It will be visible again in forty
			seconds... we will make our own
			judgments then...
			I can see it now... and I'm
			telling you that you don't have
			time to wait... not even forty
			seconds...
			Ferengi pod, out.
			Dammit, Arridor, we're seventy
			thousand light years away from
			our ships... follow us... we'll
			lead you in...
			Idiots.
			It's getting worse. I'm taking
			us in, Data... with or without
			them...
			Thrusters at half power...
			three-quarters...
			Entering outer event horizon...
			They panic quickly under
			pressure.
			There, precisely as scheduled,
			right where I expected it to be.
			Everyone's talking about the way
			you absorbed the Caldonian bid
			today...
			It was there for the taking...
			So I took it...
			Commander Riker didn't know how
			you managed it...
			Let me tell you something, Will
			Riker's good... the most dangerous
			man in the room to me... he has
			every instinct of a fine
			negotiator...
			... he just doesn't have an edge.
			Your edge.
			Our edge... and you make it sound
			unethical.
			Isn't it?
			Deanna, it's just business...
			Why haven't you told anyone that
			you're an empath?
			I find it makes people
			uncomfortable.
			I think you don't tell them...
			so you can gain an advantage.
			I used it to gain an advantage
			with you... and you didn't mind...
			The point of negotiating is to
			take advantage, Deanna. I don't
			know what the other side is
			offering, they don't know what
			I'm offering. We dance around
			each other until someone wins.
			I never cry foul when I lose.
			But you're reading their emotional
			states, their inner selves, then
			using that to manipulate them.
			Deanna, people have been doing
			that for thousands of years, by
			listening carefully, by watching
			body language. I just happen to
			be better at it. You do it.
			I do it to help my crew, not
			outmanueuver them. And I don't
			hide that I'm an empath.
			You announce it to every alien
			culture you encounter? Or do you
			use it to give your side an
			advantage. Do you tell the
			Romulan in the ship about to
			attack that you can feel that
			he's bluffing or do you just tell
			it to your captain?
			That's different. It's a matter
			of protection...
			Your protection... your captain,
			your crew... your edge.
			Yes. It's a matter of life and
			death when you take the advantage.
			Me, I deal in property, in
			exchange... no one gets hurt.
			Which of us would you say has the
			greater problem of ethics?
			May I join you, Commander?
			Bought out the Ferengi yet, Ral?
			Think I should try?
			No. But I think you will. One
			way or another, it'll come down
			to you and me.
			You know, you're very good at
			this... better than you realize.
			I hope I'm better than you
			realize, Ral.
			The last mile of the marathon
			is always the toughest. That's
			when the winners are willing to
			take the big risks... are you
			ready to do that?
			We'll see, won't we...
			Well, let's see right now... I'm
			prepared to reach a firm agreement
			with Bhavani before we learn the
			results of your probe's
			expedition. Are you?
			Mmmm, that would not be looked
			upon favorably by the Federation,
			I'd imagine.
			See, you have to be willing to
			take that last step alone...
			or it isn't worth playing.
			Your point of view, not mine.
			Oh, I see that, Commander...
			otherwise you wouldn't be second
			in command of this ship.
			You know, I feel responsible for
			you in a way... related.
			Deanna. We both love Deanna...
			in different ways, of course.
			I'll remove the burden of that
			responsibility right now. My
			relationship with Deanna stands
			on its own. Without help from
			you.
			Of course it does. She's an
			extraordinary woman. Lovely,
			brilliant --- very passionate.
			She could have been yours, Will.
			But you didn't do enough to keep
			her, and now, I'm here and I'm
			going to take her too.
			You know, I think this is the
			first bad play I've seen you
			make...
			If you bring happiness into
			Deanna's life, nothing would
			please me more. You're not really
			a bad sort, Ral, you just don't
			have any values... beyond the
			value of today's bid, that is.
			She's just the one to give some
			meaning to your sorry existence...
			if you're smart enough to take
			it. I doubt that you are.
			To the last mile.
			Federation women have a game they
			call "playing hard to get".
			Yes, I do not at all find it
			amusing.
			On Chrysalia, the women outnumber
			the men four to one. They
			virtually throw themselves at your
			feet...
			Sir, the Ferengi vessel is moving
			out of orbit, impulse power...
			They are approaching the entry
			to the wormhole, sir.
			Computer, is the Ferengi Goss
			still aboard the Enterprise?
			DaiMon Goss departed the
			Enterprise at fourteen hundred
			hours.
			Ferengi are powering forward
			missile launchers...
			Yellow Alert. Hail the Ferengi.
			DaiMon Goss responding.
			On screen.
			Request an explanation for your
			actions, DaiMon Goss.
			I have learned from informed
			sources that the Federation has
			manipulated these negotiations
			from the very beginning... and
			has already signed a secret
			agreement with the Barzans.
			That is not true...
			The Ferengi offer was never
			seriously considered.
			Premier Bhavani welcomed you to
			these proceedings, Goss... despite
			my better judgment...
			We will be ignored no longer.
			They've fired a missile directly
			at the opening, sir!
			Destroy it.
			Firing phasers.
			Your offers both have merit,
			gentlemen... if I could find a
			deciding factor...
			Riker to Picard. What's
			happening, Captain?
			Goss has fired a missile at the
			wormhole... I need you on the
			bridge, Number One...
			Excuse me.
			Excuse me for saying so under the
			circumstances, Premier... But
			this fight is really between the
			Federation and the Ferengi... it
			is unconscionable that your
			wormhole is being used as a pawn
			in their power struggle.
			You must know we will not allow
			you to do this, Goss.
			If the Ferengi cannot have the
			wormhole, no one will...
			Can he possibly believe that a
			missile will have any destructive
			effect on a wormhole?
			One of those missiles would have
			a destructive effect if it
			exploded near our shuttle...
			Goss... don't you realize we both
			have shuttlecraft in there?
			Casualties of war, Commander.
			My men are prepared to die. Are
			yours?
			Captain...
			Viewscreen off.
			He's lying. I'm almost sure of
			it. He does not mean what he
			says.
			Why... what is he doing it for
			then?
			Permission to enter the bridge,
			Captain...
			Premier, with all due respect...
			Captain, I believe I am in a
			better position to settle this
			with DaiMon Goss than you are...
			May I address him?
			DaiMon Goss, this is Devinoni
			Ral...
			I have nothing to say to you, Ral.
			Then, just listen. The planet
			of Barzan has reached an agreement
			with the Chrysalians for long term
			control of the wormhole.
			On behalf of the Chrysalians, I
			am prepared to offer the Ferengi
			free access to the wormhole in
			perpetuity...
			I have your word on this?
			My word, sir. In return for some
			Ferengi convoy privileges to be
			negotiated in good faith.
			This is an acceptable offer.
			Ferengi vessel has shut down
			forward missile launchers.
			Stand down, Red Alert.
			Commander Riker, I'm sorry you
			had to learn about my decision
			this way. You represented the
			Federation well. But I have come
			to believe that the Chrysalians'
			neutrality and tradition of peace
			is more desirable to my planet.
			Excuse me, Premier. There is
			something you should know...
			I'm sorry, was there something
			you wanted to say, Mister Ral?
			No... not at all...
			I sense you are uncomfortable
			suddenly...
			Well, after all, this was a tense
			situation...
			But that's what is so odd about
			it... it was not tense at all...
			I sensed no tension from DaiMon
			Goss... or you...
			I was tense... I was ready to
			blow it up... I strongly
			protest...
			Off screen.
			It was almost as though... you
			both were performing a scene for
			all of us...
			Excuse me, Captain, I think
			there's a slight conflict of
			interest here...
			I agree. Entirely. Devinoni
			asked me not to tell anyone about
			his empathic powers... which he
			uses to manipulate competitors
			in a negotiation.
			Certainly, that put me in a
			conflict of interest which I hope
			I have now resolved. Premier,
			I believe Ral has used your fear
			of continuing aggression between
			the Federation and its enemies
			to undermine our position. I also
			believe this incident was staged
			by Ral and Goss to provide you
			with a reason to decide in favor
			of the Chrysalians.
			Captain...
			On speaker.
			Shuttle nine to Enterprise...
			Shuttle nine to Enterprise...
			Shuttle, this is Picard... do you
			read...
			On screen...
			This is Shuttle nine... reporting
			back... barely.
			The Ferengi pod?
			They're trapped on the other side,
			sir. In the Delta Quadrant. We
			tried to warn them. They wouldn't
			follow us.
			Elaborate.
			Captain, this end of the wormhole
			is currently stable but the other
			end apparently shifts position
			periodically. The Barzan probe
			had no way to recognize this.
			Eventually, both sides will be
			unstable.
			It's a dry well, Captain.
			Worthless.
			Acknowledged, Shuttle nine. Main
			Shuttlebay, prepare for final
			approach.
			Captain, DaiMon Goss is demanding
			to know where his men are.
			Advise him to set his coordinates
			for the Delta Quadrant,
			Lieutenant... He might run into
			them in eighty years or so.
			Mister Ral, I congratulate you
			on winning the rights to the
			Barzan wormhole...
			I take the risks. I stand by my
			agreements.
			Come in...
			When do you leave?
			Soon. I've... been recalled by
			the Chrysalians... explanations
			demanded and so forth.
			I'm sorry.
			I've done all right for them over
			the years... they know the stakes.
			It'll be fine.
			I had to do it, Troi...
			Bhavani was ready to go with the
			the Federation. I sensed it.
			And I'd used up every card in the
			deck... I had to change the rules.
			You must have known that I
			couldn't allow you to do that...
			My human physical response must
			have blocked out my Betazoid
			senses.
			In a way, I'm glad you did it.
			It's made me take a hard look at
			who I am. I don't like what I
			see.
			Deanna... I once asked you to
			run away with me. I'm asking you
			again. I need you. You could
			help me change. You could be my
			conscience.
			I already have a job as a
			counselor.
