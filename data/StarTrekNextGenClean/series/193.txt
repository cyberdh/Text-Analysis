-- You were like a brother to
me. We played in the park near
the lake.
Of course -- Every summer you
came to Bergerac!
You used to make swords out of
the reeds -- And when you cut
your hand, you would run to
me, and I would say --
"Let me see --"
Oh! How did you do that?
"Playing" near the Porte de
Nesle.
And how many were against you?
No more than a hundred.
Tell me!
No... Let it go. You tell me
what you were going to say. Do
you dare?
I do dare... I love someone.
Ah!
But he does not know.
Ah!
Not yet. He is proud, noble,
brave and beautiful --
Beautiful!
What's the matter?
He is in the Guards?
Since this morning. Baron
Christien de Neuvillette. In your
own regiment.
Ah...
Promise to be his friend.
I promise.
And never let him fight a duel.
God forbid.
Oh, I love you.
I must go now. You never told
me what happened last night.
And tell him to write me. A
hundred men against one. To
write, remember. A hundred men!
What courage!
Oh... I have done better since...
Bravo.
Wonderful.
Lieutenant Barclay's performance
was superficially adequate but
clearly not rooted in The Method
approach. As a result, his
customary anxiety was evident.
I do not understand why...
-- Because it's polite, Data.
Not a bad showing after only six
weeks of lessons.
Not a bad showing period.
I... we have a very... patient
teacher.
There's an opening in my
workshop... Worf.
Well done.
Thank... thank you...
Counselor...
You've come a long way, Reg.
After... more rehearsals than I
can count.
I don't just mean your acting
ability. It takes a great deal
of courage to put yourself on
display like that.
You think so...
There was a time when nothing
could have dragged you onto a
stage in front of an audience.
You've made tremendous progress.
I... I guess...
Don't you think so?
Well...
I still feel more... more
comfortable playing somebody else.
Maybe all this is no better than
escaping into a holodeck fantasy.
I disagree. This isn't fantasy
-- it's theatre. You used to
withdraw into the holodeck. You
isolated yourself inside your own
imagination, avoiding contact with
real people.
Look at yourself now... and look
at all the other people you're
with... you're not just acting,
you're inter-acting. Give
yourself some credit, Mister
Barclay!
Maybe... you're right.
Captain's log, stardate 44704.2.
We have arrived at the Argus
Array, the remote subspace
telescope at the very edge of
Federation space.
The unmanned structure
mysteriously stopped relaying its
data nearly two months ago.
The fusion reactors that power
the array are extremely unstable.
The risk of overload is high.
What about the computer systems?
They do not seem to be functioning
at all.
Captain! I am picking up an
unidentified device! One point
eight kilometers from the array!
Onscreen.
Magnify.
Some kind of probe. I'll bet
that's what damaged the array.
Is it emitting any signals,
Lieutenant?
Negative, sir. I show no
activity.
Mister LaForge, why don't you
go out and take a closer look.
Aye, sir.
Mister Barclay, report to
Main Shuttlebay.
Enterprise, this is Shuttle Five,
in position. Ready to begin
short-range scan.
Proceed, Shuttle Five.
Let's start with the passive high
res series.
Electromagnetic band?
Give it a try.
I'm picking up visual wavelengths
only. Between forty-five...
forty-five hundred and seven
thousand angstroms.
Try the neutron densitometer.
Nothing.
Hmmmm. Doesn't seem to want to
give up any secrets. Let's go
to active scan.
No... No modulation.
You are definitely not from our
neighborhood.
Increase to three point zero.
Commander?
Yeah, Reg?
Thanks for... for assigning me
to this mission.
Don't mention it. You're one of
my top engineers. It's about time
you started to do the interesting
stuff.
This is why I'm in Starfleet.
Still no modulation.
Hit it with the positron emission.
What was that?
Our computer is down!
Reg! Reg!
Captain's log, supplemental. An
intense energy surge from the
alien probe has severly disabled
the shuttle's onboard computer.
The away team has been transported
directly to Sickbay.
Any indication of the probe's
energy source, Data?
No sir. Power emissions do not
match any known radiation
patterns. We have not encountered
this technology before.
Very well. Isolate the probe and
place it in tow. We'll take it
to Science Station Four-Oh-Two
in the Kohlan system...
Captain. The probe has begun to
move. It is approaching the
Enterprise.
Shields up!
Aye, sir.
There was enough energy in that
flash to overload your optic
nerves. It knocked you
unconscious.
My VISOR must have filtered it
out.
Exactly.
Well, there's no apparent retinal
damage and the cornea looks fine.
But I'm still waiting for the full
sero-amino readout. I'll call
you when it comes in.
You shouldn't have to... wait so
long for the results...
What do you mean?
Couldn't you use a global mode
in your scanner... It would be
a lot faster.
That's not possible.
These are human cells we're
talking about, not isolinear
circuits.
You'd better stick to engineering.
The cells have a... an
electromagnetic signature... just
like a circuit element does...
Conceptually, it should work...
with a few adjustments...
I could set it up for you if you'd
like...
Probe now closing at fifteen
point three meters per second.
Collision course.
Captain, sensors are reading no
particulate emissions or subspace
field distortions.
Then how is it able to move?
The method of propulsion is
unknown.
Ensign, take us away from it.
One quarter impulse.
Aye, Sir.
The probe is matching our speed
and course.
Captain, an energy field is
forming around the device.
Intensity is three point two
terawatts, and increasing.
Sir, the shuttlecraft shields did
not provide sufficent protection
for its computer. Our computer
may also be vulnerable. I
recommend withdrawal to a safe
distance.
Ensign Anaya, full about, go to
one-half impulse.
One-half impulse.
The probe is following.
Options, Number One?
We can't use photon torpedoes.
An explosion this close to the
ship could cripple us.
Sir, recommend full phasers.
Proceed.
Firing phasers.
No effect, Captain.
The probe's field intensity is
continuing to build... we are in
danger, Captain...
Riker to LaForge. Can you
increase phaser power?
Attempting to now, Commander.
Isolate phasers eighty through
one twenty and shunt all plasma...
... to the emitters, yessir, I'm
already on it... ready.
Captain! Phasers are as hot as
we can make them!
Mister Worf.
Aye, sir.
Nothing.
Go to warp two.
Aye, sir.
Warp two.
The probe is still with us, sir.
At warp two?
Yessir.
Captain. The probe's energy
output is overloading our shields.
Failure anticipated in forty-seven
seconds.
I'm willing to entertain
suggestions...
Captain! We're dropping to
impulse.
Commander, warp power has been
transferred to the shield grid.
Barclay, what are you doing?
Lieutenant Barclay to Captain
Picard. You can fire photon
torpedos. Maximum yield, full
spread.
We're too close.
Our shields will hold.
LaForge?
I don't know how Barclay did it,
but shield strength has been
increased by over three hundred
percent. It should be enough.
Mister Worf. Photon torpedos.
Maximum yield, full spread.
Aye.
Thank you, Mister Barclay...
You're welcome, Captain. Barclay
out.
I'm sorry if I overstepped my
authority.
Don't mention it...
Captain's log, stardate 44705.3.
The Enterprise has destroyed the
alien probe. But now we are left
with the difficult task of
repairing the Argus Telescope.
Failure to do so would represent
an irreplaceable scientific loss.
Mister Barclay.
... Everyone's still trying to
figure out exactly how you did
it.
It... it just occurred to me that
I could set up a frequency
harmonic between the deflector
and the shield grid... using the
warp field generator as a power
flow anti-attenuator and that of
course naturally created an
amplification of the inherent
energy output. (TECH?)
Uh huh.
Nice job.
Mister Barclay, I'm glad you could
join us.
Your report, Mister LaForge.
Each of the telescope's subspace
antenna clusters is powered by
its own fusion reactor. But a
single computer controls them all.
So, all eighteen reactors were
affected when the computer was
damaged... ?
They're starting to overload, and
could eventually go critical.
If that happens, the explosion
would destroy the Array. And I
wouldn't want to be next door if
that happens.
A standard isolation procedure
would be advisable.
I agree. We'll cut off each
reactor from the damaged control
system and repair them one by one.
How long will that take?
Two, three weeks -- at least.
Alright then, Mister LaForge --
I don't agree.
We could repair all the reactors
simultaneously instead of one by
one.
Simultaneously? All eighteen?
Yessir.
But the Argus computer is
inoperable.
Not entirely. The core memory
is still intact. We could program
a completely new control system.
That is an interesting suggestion,
Lieutenant. However, such an
approach would require more time
than our original plan, at least
seven weeks.
-- I can have it ready in two
days.
What?
If you could assist me in the
morning, Commander...
Sure, Reg.
The moon -- yes, that will be my
home. My paradise. I shall find
there, all the souls I love --
Socrates, Galileo...
"But what the devil is he doing
among us?"
Philosopher. Scientist. Poet,
musician, duellist -- Here lies
Hercule-Savinien De Cyrano de
Bergerac.
I would not have you weep any
less for that charming, good,
handsome Christien. I only ask
this: that as the great cold
surrounds my bones, you allow a
double meaning to your mourning
veil. And when your tears fall
for him, some few will be... for
me.
That was... a real improvement.
Thank you, Doctor. Same time day
after tomorrow?
Same time...
May I join you?
Of course. Please... Sit down,
Counselor.
Hard at work?
Getting prepared for tomorrow's
meeting in Engineering. We're
planning our repair strategy.
I enjoyed the scene you just
performed.
You're a very forgiving audience.
Not at all.
I thought you were brilliant.
You've... changed.
Is that a professional opinion?
Pure observation.
It's true. I can't explain it.
But in the last few days I've
found a confidence that I never
knew was there.
I'm proud of you, Reg... and I'm
glad for you, too.
Well, I'd better be going.
Must you?
I... think so...
Wouldn't you like to take a walk
with me through the arboretum?
The zalnias should be in bloom...
Reg, as your former counselor...
I... don't think it would be
appropriate...
-- I don't need a counselor. What
I need is the company of a
charming, intelligent woman.
Goodnight, Mister Barclay.
Where's Lieutenant Barclay?
I stopped by his quarters on my
way over. He wasn't there.
Computer, location of Lieutenant
Barclay.
Holodeck Three.
G sub I J of t as t approaches
infinity...
That's G of t over G-naught.
So it is, so it is.
I still don't see how you can
incorporate the quantum principle
into general relativity without
adjusting the cosmological
constant a lot more than you're
doing here.
If we increase the value as you
suggest, we must face the
possibility of twenty-six
dimensions, instead of ten!
I'm not sure if I'm ready for
that.
I certainly am not.
But if this semiset was curved
into the subatomic, the infinities
might cancel each other out.
Gruss Gott. They just might.
We had a meeting at Oh-seven
hundred...
I'm sorry, Commander.
Thank you, Professor.
End program.
What was that all about?
I had some ideas late last
night... I needed to consult the
computer about some quantum
electrodynamic calculations. A
holodeck Einstein program seemed
like the best way. I guess I went
a little overboard.
A little? Most of the stuff on
that blackboard was way out of
my league. Yours too.
Not really. I just never thought
along those lines before. It's
all pretty evident now... I'm sure
if you put your mind to it --
-- Ever since our run-in with the
probe, something's been different
about you.
Because I'm starting to behave
a little more like the rest of
the crew? With confidence in what
I'm doing?
You just spent the entire night
arguing Grand Unification Theories
with Albert Einstein!
Yes, but --
-- Something's happened to you,
Reg. We can't ignore that.
I've finally become the person
I've always wanted to be. Do we
have to ask why?
Yeah, I think we do...
Incredible. The production of
neurotransmitters in your brain
has jumped by over five hundred
percent. Pre and postsynaptic
membranes have increased their
permeability to match it.
I couldn't even guess at an I.Q.
level.
Probably somewhere between twelve
hundred and fourteen fifty.
But that isn't all.
The corpus callosum -- the
connecting bridge between the two
sides of the brain. It's so
active that the hemispheres have
essentially become one.
So it's not just raw intelligence
we're talking about.
Creativity, imagination,
resourcefulness, inspiration --
it's all been enhanced.
Lieutenant, you are the most
advanced human being who has ever
lived.
Captain's log; supplemental.
Apparently as a result of his
exposure to the alien probe,
Lieutenant Barclay has gained an
extraordinary new level of
intelligence. The question now
is -- how are we to deal with it?
We could confine him to his
quarters.
How can we do that? What's he
done? You're talking about
locking him up for being too
smart.
If he's under an alien influence,
doesn't that put us all at risk?
Not necessarily. For all we know
it could be more like a simple
allergic reaction to a bee
sting...
Has Mister Barclay done anything
that could be considered
potentially threatening?
He did make a pass at me last
night.
A good one.
I wouldn't exactly call that a
threat.
No, but it's definitely unusual
behavior for Barclay.
He taught violin technique at the
music school last night.
I didn't know Barclay even played
the violin.
He didn't... until last night.
Look... if we want to save the
Array, we need Barclay... It's
as simple as that...
Until he does something more
menacing than what's been
described -- I see no reason why
we should prevent him from
continuing his work.
Larson to Commander LaForge.
Go ahead, Lieutenant.
We're having trouble containing
reactor nine, sir. It's starting
to chain.
I'll be right there.
You said he made a pass... you
forgot to mention whether it was
successful or not...
Thermal levels up one hundred
seventy seven percent. Comparable
increase in neutron emissions.
Is the interface between our
computer and the Array still in
operation?
Yes.
But our computer is just too slow
to direct the repairs; the
parameters are changing too
quickly for it to keep up.
We'll have to try a remote
shutdown from here.
Transmitting commands to the Array
now, Sir. Starting close down
sequence.
Brower, increase the intake of
liquid Helium Three into the
reactor wall. We've got to cool
it off.
Transmitting commands...
Thermal levels increasing!
What happened?
Unclear... the interface isn't
fast enough.
Commander LaForge! Overload
indications on Argus generator
Five...
Seven and Fourteen.
Damn.
Can't do anything from here...
I've got to have a better
interface...
LaForge to Bridge. We're looking
at a cascade reactor failure on
the Argus.
I don't think we're gonna pull
this one out.
Reactor Nine will reach critical
in ten minutes, forty three
seconds. The subsequent explosion
will create a chain reaction along
the entire length of the Array.
LaForge. You've got ten minutes.
Ensign, standby for a jump to warp
two.
Yes, Sir.
Mister Worf, Red Alert.
Aye, Commander.
Computer.
Standing by.
Begin new program. Create as
follows: Work station chair.
Create a standard alpha-numeric
console positioned for left hand.
... Now, an iconic display console
positioned for right hand.
Tie both consoles into the
Enterprise main computer core,
utilizing a neural scan interface.
There is no such device on file.
No problem. Here's how you build
it...
Argus Reactor Nine is twenty-eight
seconds to critical.
Let's get out of here.
Warp two, Ensign.
Yes, Sir.
Helm is not responding.
Captain! We have lost computer
control!
What?
Twelve seconds to critical, Sir...
Go to manual.
I'm attempting to, sir... but
it's...
There's not enough time...
The computer is coming back on
line, sir.
Captain, the Argus reactors are
shutting down.
We are no longer in danger.
What happened?
Unknown, sir...
LaForge, what did you do?
Wasn't me, sir.
Computer, how were the Argus
reactors shut down?
A neural interface was created
to expedite the repairs.
Barclay?
Computer! Respond.
I am responding, sir. I'm sorry
if I caused you any alarm. It
was necessary in order to secure
the Array.
Barclay?
Yes, Commander...
It's me...
I was only trying to help. Our
computer was too slow to
compensate for the overload on
the Array. So I created an
interface that communicated my
thoughts directly to the central
processing unit.
Exactly what does that mean?
My body is as you see it here.
But much of my higher brain
functions and memory have been
transferred to the starboard
computer core.
Mister Barclay, please remove
yourself from the computer system
and leave the holodeck.
I'm afraid I can't, Sir.
Why is that?
My primary cerebral functions
are now operating almost entirely
from within the computer. They
have expanded to such a degree
that it would be impossible to
return to the confines of my
human brain.
Any attempt to do so would mean
my death.
That's it.
I disconnected the visual and
audio pickups. We can talk
without being monitored by...
the computer...
By Barclay.
Report, Commander.
It's now almost impossible to tell
where Barclay ends and the
computer begins. He's actually
rewriting the isolinear chips each
time he extends himself a little
further.
How do we get him out of there?
We don't. Not without killing
him.
This is an intolerable
situation... I have no wish to
harm him, but we cannot allow
Mister Barclay to continue to act
as the ship's computer... I don't
care how smart he is.
Lieutenant Barclay has not yet
extended himself into the
Engineering subsystems. It may
be possible to establish an ODN
bypass directly to the Bridge.
That won't give us control of
the ship.
No... But we would have access
to the propulsion systems. Enough
to get us to the nearest
Starbase.
How long would it take to set
it up?
A few hours.
Make it so.
Should we... discuss this with
Barclay, Captain?
I think not.
Commander LaForge?
Yeah, Reg?
I thought you would be in your
quarters.
Just catching up on some work.
That level-3 diagnostic we
talked about.
How're you doing?
I wish I could convey to you what
it's like for me now. What I've
become...
Give it a try.
I can conceive almost infinite
possibilities, and can fully
explore each of them in a
nanosecond. I perceive the
universe as a single equation,
and it is so simple, I...
understand...
Understand?
...everything.
Do you understand how this
happened to you?
I believe it is a gift... that
I have been chosen to fulfill a
great purpose...
Uh huh.
Do you suppose all this has
changed the way people think about
me?
I'll be honest with you. We don't
know what to think.
I've been concerned about that.
But soon everyone will
understand what I can do for
humanity.
They will... ?
We have always perceived the
maximum speed of the Enterprise
as a function of warp... but I
know now there are no limits...
We will explore new worlds that
we could never before have reached
in our lifetime. I will take us
to them...
Captain! I am picking up a
subspace distortion.
Mister Data?
This disturbance is the result
of a highly charged graviton field
emanating from our warp nacelles.
It is creating a severe bias in
the subspace continuum.
Lieutenant Barclay, are you
responsible for this graviton
field disturbance?
Yessir, I'm altering subspace
in a way that's never been
conceived of before. I'm fairly
certain it will allow us to travel
half-way across the galaxy in a
matter of only...
Mister Barclay, I'd like you to
hold off on this experiment for
now.
Captain, if you'd only allow
me...
Lieutenant, this is a direct
order. Discontinue whatever it
is you're doing.
I really would rather not, sir.
I'm positive you'll be pleased
with the result once I've
finished.
Audio is disconnected. We may
speak freely.
How soon before the ODN bypass
is in place?
I have been monitoring Commander
LaForge's progress. It will
be operational in approximately
seventeen minutes.
Captain, let me go to the
holodeck. Try to talk to him.
Sir, the subspace distortion is
continuing to increase...
Hello, Deanna.
Reg...
I'm sorry that we can't take that
walk in the Arboretum.
So am I.
Reg, you've frightened everyone...
I can't imagine that is your
intent.
Young children are sometimes
frightened of the world. That
doesn't mean their parents should
let them stay in their cribs.
Are we children to you, now?
I can see so much more than you
are capable of. You should trust
that.
Deanna, I've always wanted to earn
your respect.
You've got it... From all of us.
We don't need any more convincing.
Please obey the Captain's
orders... stop whatever you're
doing...
You must trust me...
How are we to trust an officer
who doesn't follow orders... ?
Trust me...
The Captain will do everything
in his power to stop you.
Picard to LaForge. Status?
Ready now, Captain.
Proceed.
Acknowledged.
Commander?
What.
You're too late.
Captain, the ODN bypass to the
Bridge has been blocked. We have
not regained control of the
propulsion systems.
Barclay!
Yes, Commander Riker?
Shut that thing down!
Captain. We are going in.
Mister Barclay!
Respond at once!
Audio is disconnected.
Lieutenant, take a security team
to Holodeck Three.
Disconnect Mister Barclay from
the computer.
Aye, Captain.
I want you to know, Lieutenant
Worf, that I understand your duty
in this matter...
Phasers. Maximum setting
... and that I in no way will take
your actions personally.
The conduits.
Fire.
LaForge! Initiate stabilization
procedure!
Resetting stabilizers to match
subspace flow matrix... stand
by...
Mister Data... ?
We are experiencing a quantum
level oscillation delay...
Doubling in intensity, every
twelve point three seconds...
He is protected by a force
field... we could not disconnect
him.
Data, how long can we take this?
Bio-cellular disruption is
imminent.
Sir!
Where are we, Ensign?
Unless something is wrong with
the sensors... We're almost
thirty thousand light years from
where we were.
The center of the galaxy.
Sir, our heading has been altered.
Approaching a planetary cluster.
Captain, all systems are back
under helm control. The computer
has resumed normal functioning.
Captain!
Emotive. Electro-chemical
stimulus-response.
Cranial plate.
Bipedal locomotion. Endoskeletal.
Contiguous external integument.
I am Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of
the Federation Starship
Enterprise.
Hierarchical collective command
structure!
Who are you?
Interrogative.
Yes. I am interrogative... And
I would appreciate an
explanation...
I believe I can help with that,
Captain.
Mister Barclay. I thought it
would be fatal if you left the
holodeck.
The Cytherians have reintegrated
me, sir.
Cytherians.
The probe was designed to instruct
outsiders on how to reach this
system. But the technologies
aren't always compatible. It
failed with the Argus computer,
and with the computer on the
shuttle. But it was able to
reprogram... me.
What do you want of us?
The same as you.
Mister Barclay... ?
You both have the same mission,
Captain...
Mission... ?
Yessir. The Cytherians are
exploring the galaxy just as we
are... The difference is they
never leave their home -- they
bring others here. They only wish
an exchange of knowledge...
They want to know us.
Captain's log, stardate 44721.9.
The Cytherians have returned the
Enterprise to Federation space.
We bring back knowledge of their
race that will take our scholars
decades to examine. Lieutenant
Barclay is apparently no worse
for his experience.
How much do you remember?
I can still remember doing
everything -- I just can't
remember how or why.
And how do you feel now?
Smaller...
Just plain old Barclay, huh...
It always seems to come back to
that, doesn't it..
Most everyone has a moment in
their lives when they exceed their
own limits... achieve what seems
to be impossible...
The tricky part is what happens
afterwards.
You almost always feel a sense
of loss. But it's possible to
carry something of that experience
through the rest of your life --
in ways that you're not even aware
of now.
I... I think I see what you're
saying...
Either way, you're an important
part of this crew.
In fact, I could use your help
tackling that level-3
diagnostic...
Sure...
Excuse me, Commander... but I
believe Mister Barclay and I had
a date scheduled for a walk in
the Arboretum... ?
The diagnostic can wait. See you
later...
You don't... don't have to do
this, you know...
I know.
May I?
Checkmate in nine moves.
I didn't know you played chess.
I don't.
