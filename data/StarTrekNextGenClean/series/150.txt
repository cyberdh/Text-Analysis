Commander Riker to Ensign Crusher.
Go ahead....
Forget to set your alarm, Wesley?
Uh, yessir. I'm... very sorry.
I'll be right there.
I didn't think you'd want to miss
this.
Captain's log, Stardate 43102.8.
We have entered a spectacular
double star system in the Kavis
Alpha sector on a most critical
mission of astro-physical
research.
Our eminent guest, Doctor Paul
Stubbs, will attempt to study the
decay of globules of neutronium
expelled at relativistic speeds
by a massive stellar explosion
which will occur here in a matter
of hours.
It is virtually a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
as dictated by the forces of
nature. But frankly, Doctor
Stubbs seems much calmer about
it all than those of us who are
simply charged with the
responsibility of delivery and
observation.
Ensign, our position....
Approaching ten million kilometers
from the neutron star...
Slow to one third impulse power...
Spectacular, isn't it, my young
friend?
Yessir.
Over and over again, the intense
gravitational pull of the little
neutron star sucks up the star material
from the red giant, and
it builds up on the surface until
it explodes... every one hundred
and ninety six years. Like
clockwork. And it is but eighteen
hours away.
Eighteen hours, seven minutes,
and ... ten seconds, Doctor.
The interstellar counterpart to
Earth's "Old Faithful". The only
predictable burst of energy in
the universe that can accomplish
our goal.
Doctor Stubbs, if you want to make
a final inspection of the unit...
Captain, I've been inspecting the
egg for twenty years... you may
lay it when ready.
Begin launch sequence.
Shuttle Bay Two, stand-by to
launch the uh, "egg"...
Standing by, Commander...
Do you know how long the
experiment will last, Wesley... ?
One billionth of a second.
Now, how would you know that?
When I heard we were going to be
part of your experiment, I read
all your published works.
Begin pre-launch sequence.
Five minutes to launch site.
Stabilize.
The ship is not responding.
Checking for failure of inertia
dampeners... Instruments say
they're working...
Captain, we're heading straight
into the path of that stellar
matter....
Shields up.
Negative. The shields won't
respond.
Impact thirty seconds.
Go to manual override to raise
shields.
Shields are rising.
Reset dampeners.
Dampeners not responding. Unable
to reset.
Reverse impulse engines.
Initiating reverse sequence.
Impact twenty seconds.
The momentum is still taking us
into the path of the
stellar matter.
Close the shuttle bay door...
Prepare for impact.
Door is frozen, Commander...
Commander Data, check all
systems... Medical personnel to
the bridge.
All systems functioning normally
again.
Computer, explanation for control
malfunction.
No control malfunction has been
recorded.
Hey, Wesley, you need some work
on your right turns...
They're running a check to find
out what happened. Everything's
okay now...
We're going into the Holodeck to
ski in Switzerland, Wes... want
to come?
Oh... I can't... I have to check
on Doctor Stubbs. He's in
Sickbay...
Wesley, I have this awkward
situation... Two gorgeous ladies,
only one of me and a terrific
program where we get snowed in
at the ski lodge... just the fire
and each other to keep us warm...
I can hold the storm for you...
meet us at the lodge later on.
I can't, Eric. There's just too
much to do...
Yeah, okay... next time.
The captain asked me to tell you
that our systems are back to
normal and we can make another
launch attempt as soon as you're
ready.
Quite a dynamic family team, you
Crushers....
It's nice to be back together.
I was at Starfleet Medical for
a year... I missed about two
inches of him.
I'm not sure I'd want my mother
to be flying through space with
me... no, I take that back. I
am sure. I wouldn't want her.
I love her dearly you understand.
Does that hurt?
My mother's a formidable woman
too. A woman of letters.
A great critic.
I know.
Good Lord, son. You didn't read
that unauthorized biography too...
I totally deny the story about
the consulate's wife on Beldoron.
We were only good friends. Is
that all the boy does, Doctor,
fly the ship and read? Doesn't
he have any fun?
Sure he does...
My studies keep me pretty busy.
I'm trying to get into the
Academy... I earn credits for
my work on the Enterprise... but
it's not the same as being
there...
Ready to sit up?
I am whole again, thank you,
Doctor.
Come along, Wesley, let's make
sure Humpty Dumpty is still in
one piece.
Computer, fix the food slot...
The food slot is functioning
properly.
Well, check it again...
The food slot is functioning
properly.
Deactivate food slot.
We're analyzing the engineering
systems data, Captain... so far
nothing unusual in the computer
log for that time period...
Run a level one diagnostic series.
We need a computer that's one
hundred percent to run Doctor
Stubbs' experiment.
... As well as the food slots in
Sickbay.
It seems to be working again.
For the moment anyway...
What can I do for you, Doctor?
Jean-Luc, how would you feel if
you were a seventeen year old and
the only starship officer whose
mother was on board... ?
If you're concerned about Wesley,
I see no evidence that there's
a problem.
I know. In a funny kind of way...
that's exactly my point. We talk.
We smile. It's almost too
polite.
Beverly, this is simply a matter
of time. I know how difficult
it was to be away.
Tell me about him.
He's... become a fine officer.
He works as hard as any member
of the crew... Riker says his
studies...
No, tell me about him.
He seems well adjusted...
Does he have many friends... has
he been in love... ?
Jean-Luc, he's come so far, so
fast. And since I've been back
I don't feel...
His dependence?
He is seventeen, Beverly.
What were you doing when you were
seventeen?
Getting into a lot more trouble
than Wesley is, I can assure you.
So was I.
Isn't that what seventeen is
supposed to be?
No cracks in the armor... we'll
be just fine...
How can you be so calm about
everything? If I was about to
make this kind of breakthrough...
I've never doubted for a moment
that this day would come, Wesley.
And I suspect some day it will
come for you as well. I see a
lot of me in you.
In my youth, they called me a
vunderkind... do you understand
vunderkind... ?
It's German, isn't it?
It means wonder child. It is
reserved for those of us who
achieve early in life. Now the
burden is yours.
The burden?
To fulfill your potential.
You will never come up against
a greater adversary than your own
potential, my young friend.
Red Alert. You should return
to your quarters immediately.
Still no visual contact?
Impossible... Mister Worf, same
magnification. Fifty degrees
starboard.
Worf, you're absolutely sure...
The sensors clearly indicate the
approach of a Borg vessel.
Shields up.
Shields are not responding.
Manual overide is jammed. It's
not gonna work this time... we
don't have shields, Captain.
Captain, they've fired energy
weapons at us...
Evasive action.
Bring about to two-eight-five mark three.
Predict current vector of the Borg
ship.
Vector... is gone.
And so is the Borg vessel.
You're telling me this was another
computer glitch?
It is conceivable that we were
viewing a synthetically
generated image... although there
is no precedent for it.
Our computer was daydreaming... ?
Computer, identify malfunction
immediately.
Pawn to King Three... Knight to
Rook Four... Queen to Bishop
Three...
Controls are not responding.
Impulse engines are down.
Try warp engines.
Sorry, Commander... I better get
back to engineering...
Lieutenant Worf, you will
accompany Commander LaForge.
I want a full report on the
prospects for getting our shields
back. Commanders Data and Riker
will join me in the conference
room to consider the future of
this mission... if there is one.
The fact of the matter is we're
dealing with a potential breakdown
of our main computer...
That's hard to accept.
The system automatically provides
for self-correction, Captain.
There has not been a system-wide
technological failure on a
starship in seventy-nine years.
Excuse me, Captain, Doctor Stubbs
has been waiting to see you. I
think it might be wise if...
Captain, I'm sure you have
everything under control, I'd just
like to know what's going on.
Of course, Doctor. Sit down.
Counselor...
Commander LaForge is attempting
repairs as we speak...
"Attempting" ... that doesn't sound
particularly reassuring.
Doctor, if it is at all possible,
we will continue this mission as
planned.
Captain, if we miss our chance
now we don't get another for two
centuries. There will be many
questions asked by Starfleet if
the Enterprise fails in its
duty...
Nevertheless, my first and
foremost concern will be to insure
the safety of this ship and its
crew...
Insure the safety, Captain or are
you really talking about playing
it safe?
My dear Doctor, in our current
position, when that star explodes,
you'll get to watch your
experiment from the inside out.
I would rather die than leave.
I don't believe you speak for the
majority, Doctor.
Doctor Stubbs, I know how much
this means to you...
My dear Counselor, no insult
intended but please turn off your
beam into my soul. I will share
the feelings I wish to share...
Lieutenant Worf to Captain Picard.
Captain, all weapons systems are
down.
Estimated time for repairs?
Commander, I don't even know what
to repair yet.
Continue to advise.
Well, if we do not take our leave
in time, so be it... it's one sure
way into the history books, eh?
His nonchalance is studied and
practiced...
Even my sensory perception picked
that up today...
In fact, he's put his entire self-worth
on the line with this
experiment. He is telling the
truth when he says he'd rather
die than leave.
And one more thing... he doesn't
like women very much.
Odd. The research material on
Doctor Stubbs includes not a few
references from gossip columns.
It suggests females find him quite
attractive.
Not this one.
What happened to you?
We had a little accident on the
Holodeck....
On the Holodeck... but it's
programmed to prevent injuries...
I was making a great run down a
deserted slope when the ground
just seemed to fall away....
Engineering, this is Doctor
Crusher. The Holodecks are to
be closed by my order until
further notice.
We've been having control problems
today. There's a small fracture
here... this'll just take a
minute...
You look like you could use
something warm inside you... hot
chocolate, maybe?
Wes almost came along. It's
probably a good thing he didn't.
I didn't know he was going skiing
with you...
It was one of those last minute
things... we tried to grab him
on the way...
We don't see much of him now that
he's been assigned to the bridge.
Omigod....
What happened...
He's not breathing...
If he had been alone, he would
have died.
Advise everyone to remain in their
quarters when not on duty.
Protocol "B" access to all power
components. Nobody else uses them
unless it's cleared by Commander
Riker.
Sir, is it possible this is not
a computer breakdown?
What if it is some form of attack?
Our sensors showed no sign of life
in this stellar system.
They also showed a Borg vessel
that did not exist. Counselor
Troi?
I perceive no life force,
Captain... no feelings of ill
will. But I am not attuned to
every form of life.
Data, stay on the sensors... see
if we can't pick up something
out there.
It does almost seem as if
something... or someone is trying
to render the Enterprise helpless.
They're not just trying, Number
One. If it's true, they're doing
a damn good job of it.
You got it. Nice going, Geordi...
Call up the cross-section of
computer core processor
four-five-one, elements
zero-two-hundred through
zero-three-hundred.
In order to get some power, I had
to by-pass the computer core and
essentially hotwire the
connection.
Look at that lesion. No wonder
we're coming apart at the seams.
It's some kind of continuing
disintegration. But from what... I
can't tell ya. And I haven't the
slightest idea how to stop it.
But it's just a mechanical
problem, right?
Increase magnification, factor
fifty.
I don't know, Wesley. Looking
at it... if it weren't...
impossible... I'd say someone had
climbed in there and started
taking it apart.
Guinan... I didn't think anyone
would be here.
I've never been very good at being
confined to quarters. Any of my
husbands would testify to that.
What are these things?
I'm just setting... traps.
I run a clean place here.
I know. It's not that. I just...
Guinan, I'm scared. Everything
that's been going wrong may be
my fault.
Pull up a stool, Wesley.
I've been working on my final
project for Advanced Genetics.
It's on nanotechnology. And I've
been studying the nanites we have
in the Sickbay genetic supplies.
They're just like tiny little
robots with gigabytes of
mechanical computer memory, tiny
enough to enter living cells and
conduct repairs. They're supposed
to be strictly confined to the
lab.
Are you trying to say some nanites
are on the loose?
Two of them. That's all. See,
I just wanted to see how they
would interact and function in
tandem. In my project, I had
proposed a theory that they could
actually combine their skills to
improve their usefulness. And
it was working.
You made a better nanite.
I was pulling an all-nighter to
get my final data... and I fell
asleep. When I woke up, I
realized the container was still
open...
It was just a science project.
A doctor once said the very same
thing to me... what was his
name... Frankenstein, I think.
They're really harmless. They
only have the most basic skills.
It's almost impossible that they
could be responsible...
Almost.
Doctor Crusher to Wesley Crusher.
Go ahead.
I stopped by your quarters, Wes.
I assumed you'd be there, since
you're off duty.
I was just... I had some things
to do...
Orders are orders, Mister Crusher.
You won't tell anybody...
I know. I will. If it's true.
Wesley...
Think you'll get a good grade?
I always get an A.
So did Doctor Frankenstein.
Captain's log, supplemental. Our
computer core has clearly been
tampered with and yet there is
no sign of a breach of security
on board.
We have even considered sabotage,
but Counselor Troi has not
detected any such sentiments.
We have engines back and will
attempt to complete our mission...
but without a reliable computer,
Doctor Stubbs' experiment is in
serious jeopardy.
Manual restart sequence?
Manual restart successful...
impulse engine functions appear
normal.
Proceed.
Shuttle Bay Two, open hangar
doors.
Doors did not respond. Repeating
sequence.
What in heaven's name... ?
It is "Stars and Stripes Forever"
by John Phillip Sousa, a popular
American composer of band music
in the early twentieth century...
Yes... yes... I know...
Computer, shut off the music....
The music is on all communications
channels, Captain.
Power... weapons...
communications. We're being
stripped one system at a time...
Shut off the power to the bridge.
I feel no hostile emotions
present. No friendly feelings
either. Nothing.
Only an enemy without honor
refuses to show himself in battle.
We may be fighting a different
kind of enemy than we've ever
known... an enemy that fights a
war of nerves.
Resume power to the bridge.
Commander LaForge, can you get
us out of this star system
safely...
No...
Not now, Doctor.
I'll try, Captain. I don't want
to overload the engines...
Do it gently. But do it.
We'll circuit in auxiliary power
to the bridge... and find some
way to silence Sousa if he tries
an encore.
The priority is to find out who
or what is doing this and why.
Those of us not involved in that
detail should get a few minutes
rest. Commander Data, the bridge,
or what's left of it, is yours.
The egg that Stubbs laid.
Nobody will say that...
Nobody will say... anything,
Wesley. We will not even be
mentioned.
I could live with failure.
... Well, maybe not. But never
even to try. To miss your one
chance at bat. Do you know
baseball?
My dad taught it to me when I was
little.
Once, centuries ago, it was the
beloved national pastime of the
Americas, Wesley. Abandoned by
a society that prized fast food
and faster games. Lost to
impatience. But I have seen the
great players make the great
plays.
Do you recreate them on a
Holodeck?
No, in here...
With the knowledge of
statistics... runs, hits and
errors... times at bat... box
scores. Men like us do not need
Holodecks, Wesley. I have played
seasons in my mind. It was my
reward to myself. For patience.
Knowing my turn would come. Call
your shot. Point to a star. One
great blast and the crowd rises.
A brand new era in astro-physics.
Postponed one hundred and
ninety-six years on account of
rain.
We have to talk.
You really look like you could
use some rest...
I know. It's okay. Really.
No, it's not. Really.
I'm just checking some traps that
I set... to see if I can find out
what's happening to the ship.
On someone's orders... ?
We're running out of time for
Doctor Stubbs...
Wesley, you can't put everything
on your own shoulders. Even when
you're off duty, you're on duty...
Mom, you don't understand...
You're a seventeen year old boy...
I'm an acting officer... I have
responsibilities....
I'm beginning to think... maybe
we're all expecting too much of
you.
I've done everything anyone has
asked of me and more. You don't
know... you haven't even been
here.
I'm here now, Wesley.
C'mon, I'll help you finish this
up... what are you looking for?
Wesley... ?
Mom, I think I've made a horrible
mistake.
Nanites. Tiny machines built from
the atom up.
Designed to have exposure only
to the inside of nucleii during
celluar surgeries. Until then,
they are kept tightly confined
in a non-functional state.
These are not ordinary nanites.
No, these have... evolved.
Evolved... how does a machine
evolve...
It's true. I'm reponsible. I
allowed two of the nanites to
interact for my school project
to increase their capabilities.
And... they escaped.
School... project...
Just how far have these things...
evolved?
This is a sample of linear memory
crystal from our computer core.
It's like candy to them...
They're now capable of
mechanically replicating
themselves. And who knows what
else....
It is conceivable that with each
new generation they enhance their
own design. The rate of evolution
would be...extraordinary.
How many generations are we
dealing with here?
Engineering, display computer
core processor four-five-one,
element zero-two-nine-nine.
Increase magnification, factor
one thousand.
A few.
Can it be possible that they know
what they're doing...
Why would they attack us?
Why does a mosquito bite your ear
and who cares? The answer is
simple. Call an exterminator.
Doctor Stubbs, these nanites are
apparently operating with a new
collective intelligence... working
together, teaching each other
skills...
Doctor, are you suggesting they
are becoming a... civilization?
Oh really. I'm sorry but this
is nonsense. You can't have a
civilization of computer chips.
They're made in a plant in Dakar
Senegal. I've watched the
construction.
Then how do you explain what
you've seen here?
It's no more mysterious than
watching a strain of the Leutscher
virus reproduce itself. And that
at least is a bona fide lifeform.
How many disease germs and viruses
have you destroyed in your time,
Doctor Crusher?
I cannot exterminate... something
that "may or may not" be
intelligent.
My good Captain...
There is still time.
Ensign Crusher, work with Data
to find some way to remove them
safely. If things get worse,
we'll take stronger measures.
Gentlemen. I need a computer
functioning perfectly in less
than eight hours... and we still
have core reconstruction to
consider...
We're testing a low level gamma
field that might reduce their
processing speed.
Have you considered a high level
charge?
High level gamma radiation would
kill them, Doctor Stubbs.
I know.
Doctor Stubbs...
I can't get the story of David
and Goliath out of my head. How
long do we wait, Number One?
We can continue to bypass parts
of the computer that are
affected... but if these nanites
are spreading all over the ship...
Do you smell a change in...
Picard to LaForge...
enviromental system malfunction
on the bridge... acknowledge...
Nitrogen oxide... toxic levels...
I've switched to manual control
of the air handling system...
He entered a computer access
room and sterilized one of the
processors with gamma radiation.
The nanites in the upper core
are all dead, Captain.
You have no choice now... it is
a matter of survival.
If you were a member of my crew,
sir, I would...
But I am not a member of your
crew, sir... I am a representative
of the highest command of the
Federation... which has directed
you to perform my experiment...
If one man, woman or child on my
ship dies because of your
experiment... I will have your head
before the highest command of the
Federation...
Good Lord, you are talking about
machines with a screw loose.
Simply turn them off. And be done
with them.
Doctor Stubbs, your own actions
have provided evidence to the
contrary. After you destroyed
the nanites in the core, they
immediately responded by
interfering with our life-support
systems.
It is hard to accept these as
random actions by machines with
"loose screws". In effect, you
may have proven that the nanites
do have a collective intelligence.
Captain, I'm feeling a vague
presence. It wasn't there before.
It is not hostility... More like
a primitive sense of
self-preservation.
If they have evolved this
far... into emotional growth... how
can we destroy them now?
The ship is at risk.
Extermination may be the only
alternative left.
A good point...
Lieutenant Worf, Doctor Stubbs
is to be restricted to his
quarters until further notice.
Data, can you find me a way to
communicate with these things?
With intelligence, they have the
capacity for language.
But it will depend on how far
their evolution has brought them.
We could modify the circuits in
the universal translator to make
it capable of communications with
them...
Proceed.
May I come in?
You just can't resist, can you,
Counselor?
I only want to help.
Yes, yes... to break the shell...
to get in touch with my true
feelings. What is this
preoccupation women have with
de-mystifying me? It must be the
challenge. Climb me. Because
I'm there.
I am only worried about your state
of mind, Doctor.
All right, Counselor... what is
it that has you so worried?
Your single-mindedness, your need
to have this experiment work...
But it will. Picard has no choice
now. He must defend the
Enterprise.
Counselor, when this is over, I
will show you New Manhattan on
Beth Delta-One as you've never
seen it and we will laugh over
glasses of champagne.
Your self portrait is so
practiced, so polished....
Yes, isn't it, though?
It is stretched so tight that the
tension fills this room. And if
you finally... fail... I fear it
will snap.
A good try, Counselor. But
sometimes when you reach beneath
a man's self portrait, as you so
eloquently put it, deep down,
inside... what you find... is
nothing at all.
Lockman on first, Dark on
second... Thompson at the plate...
Branca on the mound...
He's coming around...
I have to believe this was not
an arbitrary attack...
Has Data made any progress in
contacting them?
You must protect me. Kill them.
Commander Riker, on my signal,
we will gamma-irradiate all
computer systems throughout the
Enterprise to end this conflict.
Worf, prepare to activate gamma
pulse generators.
Electromagnetic scanners ready,
Captain.
Captain...
I have established contact.
Are you okay?
I will be. As soon as we finish
off these pests.
Wesley, do not be too harsh in
your judgment of me... until
you've walked a lifetime in my
shoes.
We are no different, you and I.
For you right now, it's getting
into the Academy. For me, it's
the egg. Others will never
understand how important our work
is to us. It's everything we live
for.
Doctor Stubbs, I want to go the
Academy. But if I don't, I have
other things to live for.
Of course you do.
They are virtually learning the
concept of communication as we
continue, Captain... each new
generation is making
modifications.
Can we actually talk to them yet?
I think it is worth an attempt...
Ask them for a cease-fire... put
it in whatever words you think
they'll understand.
Captain, their answer is... no.
Tell them it is critical to their
survival as well as our own.
Their answer is no.
I sense that after the incident
in the computer core, there is
very little trust...
Bring Doctor Stubbs to the bridge.
The universal translator has its
limits. I prefer to negotiate
eye to eye with my enemy...
I don't think there's much chance
of that here.
But they have already tried to
kill me once...
"One sure way into the history
books", Doctor...
Tell them the human who destroyed
their comrades is here and wishes
to address them...
Captain, if I might...
And you, sir will explain your
error and apologize and pray that
we can negotiate a peace we can
all live with... is that clear?
Captain, if a face to face
negotiation would be helpful,
I would like to volunteer myself
as a conduit.
Yourself, Data?
I can easily furnish the nanites
with a schematic design of my
neurological structure. Entering
my neural network would require
only their most basic skills.
That's what they were designed
for.
They could easily penetrate the
molecular fabric of my
hand-covering into the nerve
circuitry and interface with my
verbal programs.
If they have control of a
Starfleet commander, they become
an even greater threat.
How do we know we'll ever get them
out of you, Data...
There are considerable risks.
But it would also represent a
gesture of trust on our part.
It could be an important step
toward peace.
All right. Propose it to the
nanites.
The answer is yes.
They are ready, Captain.
Proceed.
You are very strange looking
creatures.
In our travels, we have
encountered many other
creatures... even stranger-looking
than we are... and all of us try
to co-exist peacefully.
The urge among us to destroy all
of your kind is intense. Why did
you attack us?
We misinterpreted your actions
as an attack against us.
We were only seeking raw materials
for our replication process.
Yes, but you endangered the vessel
in which we all travel.
You almost killed a crewmember.
We meant no harm. We were only
exploring.
We understand. We are also
explorers and we mean no harm to
any life-form.
I am the one responsible for the
deaths in the computer core.
We know who you are.
I... deeply regret the incident.
I am a scientist on an important
mission. Your... your colleagues'
exploration of the core memory
put our mission at risk. I only
meant to protect a lifetime of
work from being destroyed.
I am at your mercy.
What is "mercy"?
He asks you to forgive him. This
conflict was started by
mistakes... on both sides. Let
us end it here and now.
We agree.
I pledge to you that we will
provide any assistance you need
for your continued survival.
Thank you, but we have evolved
beyond any need for your
assistance. This vessel has
become too confining. We require
relocation.
Captain's log, Stardate 43104.7.
Doctor Stubbs has generously used
his influence to arrange the
designation of planet Kavis-Alpha-Four
as the new home of the Nanite
Civilization. Plans to negotiate
a treaty are underway.
Commander Data's neural network
has been vacated... He has been
returned to us, unharmed, and with

obviously looks at him with
extraordinary affection...
What do you know about this girl?
