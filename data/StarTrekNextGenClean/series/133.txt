Captain's log, Stardate 42303.7.
The Enterprise is bound for Star
Station India to rendezvous with
a Starfleet courier.
Hopefully the mission will
provide an opportunity to
evaluate our newest staff
officer...
In the short time she's been
aboard, Doctor Pulaski has
distinguished herself as a
meticulous and competent
physician. But can someone so
focused on her own specialty also
assume the broader duties of the
ship's Chief Medical Officer?
... warp drive theory always came
easy for me, but I'm looking
forward to some hands on
experience.
I'm sure we'll be able to
accommodate you.
I know what you mean. It's a
really electrifying experience
to be down there where the action
is. Whenever I push the drive
past warp six I still get a lump
in my throat.
Can I get you another?
Tell me Commander. Is it the
custom on the Enterprise for the
First Officer to wait on
trainees?
If they were all like you, I'm
certain it would be.
What's it like these days at the
academy? Is Tsiolkovski still
teaching Propulsion Theory?
Are you kidding? They'll have
to tear down the building around
him. The first time I saw him...
Same again.
Good to see you, Commander. When
you missed your test this morning
we all feared the worst.
My apologies, Doctor. A minor
crisis...
in Engineering.
You know, a Rheinman tissue
sample sounds a good deal worse
than it is. I can assure you
there's no discomfort involved.
It's not that! It's just... my
duties are so diverse.
Suppose we leave the appointment
open?
Spontaneity is the sand in the
clockworks of science.
But it's just an unimportant
detail...
If I didn't consider it important
I wouldn't insist. Don't force
me to relieve you of duty to make
my point.
You can't be --
I'll work something out. But
my schedule is tight for the next
three or four days...
So I see.
Beautiful, isn't it?
The most beautiful thing I know.
Picard.
Captain, this is the bridge.
We're receiving a distress signal
on an open sub-space frequency.
Sound emergency stations, and
respond on the same frequency.
Sickbay on full emergency
status, Captain.
Stand by, Doctor. Commander
Data. Have we locked on to the
signal yet?
Yes, sir. A voice only
transmission from the USS
Lantree, a Federation supply
ship.
Lantree, this is Jean-Luc Picard
of the USS Enterprise. What
is the nature of your emergency?
-- can't hold out any -- dying
-- too many -- help ...
Sir, we are still recieving their
signal. There is simply no
message.
Lantree! Are you under attack?
USS Lantree, this is the
Enterprise, come in, Lantree.
Replay that last transmission.
-- can't hold out any -- dying
-- too many -- help ...
Counselor?
Great stress is all I'm able to
sense.
Have we got a fix on her?
Two point two milli-parsecs,
bearing three-zero at one-four-
five degrees.
Number One?
We better take a look.
What vessel is it?
USS Lantree, a class R Starfleet
supply ship assigned to Gamma
seven seven, Captain L.I. Taleka
commanding. Normal complement,
twenty-six officers and crew.
Armed?
Class three defensive only.
Is she still underway?
Indeed. She is at maximum speed.
Alter course to intercept.
Course to intercept.
Execute.
Let's go to Yellow Alert.
Yellow Alert, sir.
Engineering?
Engineering.
Give us maximum warp.
Maximum warp, sir.
Let's show 'em what we've got.
Go to the backpanels and give
me a direct reading of the
dilithium temperature spread.
What happened?
My fault, sir. Missed the turn.
Ensign... maybe you better stay
in the control room.
Open hailing frequencies.
Hailing frequencies open.
Lantree, this is the Enterprise.
Captain Telaka, this is Picard,
USS Enterprise. Do you read me?
No life signs, Captain.
Nothing?
Nothing, sir.
This could be an ambush.
Force fields up. Arm photon
torpedoes.
Force fields up.
Torpedoes armed and ready.
Red alert.
What else have we got in the
neighborhood?
No other vessels of any kind
within two parsecs.
No battle damage.
All systems seem functional,
Captain. Everything is in perfect
order.
And no life signs.
No life signs.
We're going to have to board her,
Will.
The only way we can wind up in
the same starfield is if you
bring us out of warp speed at
precisely the same instant as
the Lantree.
First I have to get control of
the her engines. Very tricky.
That's why we gave you the job.
Let me know as soon as you're
set.
Will I be on the away team?
Too dangerous for a valuable man
like you.
Fortunately, first officers are
expendable.
Just in case we don't make it
back...
It was a pleasure.
I'll man the bridge station.
Our first problem is to gain
control of the Lantree's drives.
Come on. You'll get a chance
to see what the bridge is like
on alert.
Ready to give it a try, Captain.
First we have to download the
Starfleet access codes for the
Lantree...
Ensign?
Yes, sir.
Perhaps you'd like to take a look
from down here.
Thank you, Captain.
We're going in amidships
protected by an isolation
forcefield. We'll take one quick
look. Fifteen seconds. If we
don't like what we see, we beam
back immediately.
We have a lock on the Lantree,
Commander.
Okay, let's drop out of warp
speed. And see if you can keep
us in the same galaxy.
Sorry about that. We got as
close as we could.
That's okay, Geordi. What's a
light year among friends?
If it looks secure at first
glance, we'll proceed to the
bridge.
If we find anyone alive, the
medical team will beam over.
Set phasers for kill.
Let's do it.
I have the ship's logs, sir.
Let's see if anbody's home.
What is it?
How's the environment?
No abnormal viral or bacterial
forms.
They were carrying passengers?
He is not a passenger. He is a
crewmember.
But he's nearly two hundred years
old!
It would seem they all are.
How old was Captain Telaka?
Thirty-two earth years.
Enterprise... this is the USS
Lantree.
Enterprise here.
Captain, the entire crew has been
wiped out.
What happened?
It looks like they were in a
battle with time, and lost.
Chief medical officer's log.
Extensive autopsies performed
on the crew of the Lantree reveal
a gamut of primary organ failures
as the direct cause of death.
Transporter Room, we're finished
here. Thanks for your help.
You're welcome, Doctor.
Energizing now.
Captain. We've returned the last
of the Lantree crew to their
ship.
How soon will you have an autopsy
report, Doctor?
From everything we can see...
they all died of natural causes.
Natural causes? What in nature
could kill an entire crew at the
same time?
For the record Captain, these
people died of old age.
Sir, according to the Lantree
logs the oldest crew member was
seventy-three, and the mean age
of the crew was thirty-two point
six six.
Doctor?
Every member of the Lantree crew
had a complete examination at
the beginning of their last duty
cycle just eight weeks ago.
They were in perfect health.
Nothing since then? No geriatric
symptoms reported?
A single medical entry noting
that the first officer was
treated for Thelusian flu five
days ago.
Thelusian flu?
An exotic, but harmless rhinal
virus. And there was no evidence
of infection in the first
officer's autopsy.
If we don't know what we're
looking for, how can we be
certain the Lantree is safe?
We can't. We'll have to assume
whatever caused this is still
aboard.
Lieutenant Worf. You know what
to do.
Sir.
Captain, the Lantree's last port
of call was three days ago. The
Darwin Genetic Research Station
on Gagarin Four.
At the very least they deserve
a warning.
I was thinking of a quarantine.
I'll consider that possibility.
You'll con --
Captain. If Starfleet had wanted
you to make the medical
judgments they wouldn't have
assigned you a medical officer.
Number One. Set course for
Gagarin Four. Warp nine. We'll
depart the moment our security
officer returns.
Codename Firestorm. Access A-D-
three-three-two-four-nine.
Federation security code
recognized. Access confirmed.
Set auto-destruct. Twenty second
delay.
Auto-destruct active. Eighteen
seconds... sixteen seconds...
Energize.
Twelve seconds... ten seconds...
Cutting it a little close weren't
y--?
Find it?
All set. It was the sensor
contact.
-- sensor contact.
Just like you said it would be.
Let's get it back in the panel
and do a quick line test.
Yes, sir!
Come with me.
Running the Engineering Section
is no different than running the
drive system. I've got to keep
everything in balance. To get
maximum efficiency out of --
Don't bother, I've heard it all
before. It's not your problem,
anyway. It's me.
That's right. You've got plenty
of aptitude, but you're
attitude's not makin' it.
What do you know about my
attitude? How'd you like it if
people always behaved as if
you're some kind of freak?!
What do you think this is? My
ticket to success?
Wait.
I'm... sorry. Maybe I'm the one
who's blind.
What you are is maybe the most
talented engineer to come out
of the Acadamy since... well
since me. Doing this job's in
your blood. Now all we've got
to do is convince the rest of
'em.
Deal?
Deal.
Open hailing frequencies.
Hailing frequencies open.
Darwin Station. This is Captain
Jean-Luc Picard of the USS
Enterprise, on course for Gagarin
Four.
Enterprise, this is Darwin
Station. I'm Doctor Mandel.
We've just declared a state of
emergency here. We need your
help, but you must stand off.
Doctor Mandel, what is the nature
of your emergency?
To whom am I speaking, please?
I'm Doctor Pulaski, chief medical
officer.
Katherine Pulaski? "Linear
Models of Viral Propagation?"
Yes, but that was a long time
ago.
And still the standard.
I'm sorry to meet you under these
circumstances, but I can't
imagine anyone I'd rather be
dealing with.
Bring me up to speed on your
situation. What are the factors?
Rapid onset of geriatric
phenomena. One hundred percent
fatal in the advanced stages.
Presentation?
Acute arthritic inflammation.
Pervasive and virtually
instantaneous.
Since Darwin is doing genetic
research...
Our research, here, is limited
to human genetics. I assure you
we're not dealing with some
mutated pathogen that "got away
from us." We believe the
infective agent was introduced
by a supply ship that was here
three days ago.
Doctor, we encountered The
Lantree a few hours ago.
They lost all hands.
That would seem to confirm our
analysis. Were you able to
establish a pathology?
Organ failure consistent with
advanced geriatric --
Doctor Mandel! Did you hear what
I said? The twenty-six men and
women aboard the Lantree are all
dead!
I heard you Captain! And the
prognosis is alarming. But my
immediate concern is the
children.
Children?
We have thirty-two children here.
They've been kept in positive
isolation since the onset, and
so far they've shown no symptoms.
You must evacuate them as soon
as possible.
I'm sorry. We'll lend any
assistance we can, but I won't
risk the lives of --
Doctor Pulaski... you've got to
convince him.
These children are more than our
progeny. They represent all our
years of advanced genetic
research. If he can't think of
humanity, think of science!
I heard you Doctor. And I
understand completely. We'll
reach Gagarin Four in a little
over three hours. Until then.
I recommend against contact,
Captain.
Number One?
I agree, sir. I wish there was
something we could do, but the
risk is too great.
Doctor?
As a first step I'd like to bring
a couple of the children aboard
and examine them.
If they're infected... ?!
Doctor Mandel has assured us they
are not.
Counselor?
Doctor Mandel clearly believes
the children are safe, but she
isn't telling us the whole truth.
I recommend caution.
The two children could be encased
in styrolite. They'll be in
suspended animation. We can scan
them for possible infection
without any danger to
ourselves...
or to them.
Until we know what we're facing --
Exactly. And we won't know until
we begin gathering data.
Captain, we're talking about
saving children's lives. Isn't
that worth some risk?
We're always at risk, Doctor.
You may proceed with your
examination, but I shall demand
positive proof that these
children are harmless before
placing the lives of my crew in
jeopardy.
Approaching Gagarin Four on
impulse power, Captain.
Thank you, Mister Crusher.
Standard orbit.
Aye, sir.
Containment forcefield ready,
Captain.
Activate.
Doctor Mandel, are you ready to
transport?
You have the coordinates. We
have one male and one female,
standing by.
Transporter, energize.
A trick!
Transporter room. Reverse the
trans --
Hold on that, Number One.
Whoever they are, they're in
stasis. Lieutenant Worf?
The styrolite's intact, Captain.
Captain, I...
There's a definite presence --
two distinct personalities. Even
in stasis... It's quite strong.
They are unquestionably
telepathic.
Earth humans. Somewhat larger
than normal. Approximately
twenty years old --
Extraordinary.
We could be looking at the future
of humanity.
Or at least Doctor Mandel's
vision of it.
I want to free them from the
styrolite.
Are you absolutely certain
they're safe?
These children are in better
health than we are. Their immune
system is so advanced, it may
not even be possible for them
to contract disease.
But how can we be --
There's no way we can be
absolutely certain until we know
what's causing the disease.
Then until we can answer that
question, we can't --
We don't have that kind of time.
Captain, look at these children.
Set aside the fact that they are
human beings and we are their
only hope.
We're talking about a new chapter
in genetic science.
But the risk. The risk is --
Minimal. They'll continue to
be isolated inside a forcefield.
Commander Riker, assemble the
bridge crew in the observation
lounge in fifteen minutes.
Doctor Pulaski has a proposal
she'd like us to consider.
Yes, sir.
And Doctor... I'm not one to
discourage input, but I'd
appreciate it if you'd at least
let me finish my sentences once
in a while.
You have a minute?
Of course.
Deanna... You've known the
captain for some time...
I guess I could use some advice.
I don't think I'm dealing with
him very well.
Why do you say that?
My arguments seem to go right
past him. We wind up shouting
regulations at each other.
It takes time to get to know him.
But he's very fair, and he has
excellent judgment.
I know he's a talented commanding
officer.
But he's so caught up in... his
ship, his responsibility... He
doesn't seem able to step back...
to see the whole canvas.
Kate, I don't think he would be
where he is if he couldn't see
the "whole canvas."
Staff officers report to the
Observation Lounge.
Maybe your problem is that the
two of you aren't all that
different.
What do you mean?
Let's just say you're both well
established personalities.
Doctor Pulaski's studies indicate
the children are harmless. She
believes the rest of the colony's
children should be beamed aboard
and transported to a new
environment while there's still
time to save them.
Are you sure they're safe?
No.
In the time we have available,
the only true test is to expose
the children to another human
being.
I plan to free them from the
styrolite--inside a forcefield
containment.
I'll be inside the containment
area myself.
You would risk yourself?
They're living beings and they
need our help.
I don't like it. If we lost the
force field for some reason...
we could lose the ship.
But the children are in perfect
health. And we can use double
redundant forcefields.
As Geordi says, forcefields can
fail. And until --
Captain, I can understand your
concern, but --
You say you understand, Doctor,
but I wonder if you do.
If you can find a way to prove
the children are biologically
harmless without risking the
crew, I'll do everything in my
power to assist.
Captain?
I'm concerned about our CMO.
She's absolutley obsessed with
the medical viewpoint. She
doesn't seem able to step back
and see the overall picture.
What's the matter?
Nothing, Captain. Perhaps you
and the CMO just need to give
each other a little more time.
Doctor Mandel, this is Kate
Pulaski.
Doctor? Do you have a decision?
Yes. I'm afraid it's bad news.
How can that be?!
The risk to our ship and crew
is too great. Until we're
absolutely certain of the cause
of the disease, the children --
But the children were never on
the Lantree!
You can't do this! For God's
sake! I demand that you do
something to save our children.
We haven't much time.
Stand by. I'll get back to you.
What's the it?
Our error rate is up nearly forty
percent.
You mean: since I came aboard.
I need your help. I've got very
little time. I've got to find
a way to test the children, to
make sure they're harmless. And
I need a fail-safe environment.
The problem is, there's no area
on the ship that can be sealed
off with absolute certainty.
What about the Sickbay?
Doesn't the Sickbay have
isolated systems?
The Sickbay has independant
systems, but it's not possible
to totally cut it off from the
rest of the ship. The only
truely independent environment
would be the shuttlecraft, or
something like --
The shuttlecraft?
Why didn't you say so?
Come.
Captain, I'd like permission to
take the children aboard the
shuttlecraft
If the experiment is...
unsucessful, the shuttlecraft
can simply be abandoned here at
Darwin.
And you along with it.
Doctor, you are the chief medical
officer of the Starship
Enterprise. You have a
responsibility to this ship --
And to humanity.
The Starfleet guidelines about
contact with quarantined --
Listen, you don't need to quote
the rule book --
You were saying?
Request approved.
Captain, you said if I...
Approved?
Doctor, I can't condone the
jeopardy you're assumming, but
I recognize that you have
satisfied my conditions.
Thank you.
Doctor? You sent for me?
I did, Commander. I assume
you're qualified to pilot this
shuttlecraft.
Certainly. I was trained at --
I'm sure you were. Please get
aboard, we don't have much time.
Doctor, what's going on?
We're performing the experiment
aboard the shuttlecraft.
The captain approved this?
Yes. Now if you'll clear the
area, please; we haven't much
time.
Doctor, I can't allow you to risk
yourself like this.
Captain, this is Riker --
Commander Riker... that item in
your medical record is still
unresolved, if I'm not mistaken?
What does that...
You can't be serious.
Computer, this is Chief Medical
Officer Pulaski.
I'm relieving Commander William
Riker from active duty for
medical reasons effective
immediately.
Let's go.
All personnel, clear the shuttle
bay.
Computer -- override shuttle
operations! Halt departure!
Secure the shuttle!
Riker, William T. Presently on
inactive duty status. No command
authorization.
All personnel, clear the shuttle
bay.
You'll take us a few hundred
meters away from the Enterprise,
and hold position.
Begin shuttlecraft launch
sequence.
Shuttle Bay One is clear. Access
hatch sealed. Initiating
decompression.
Stand by to open shuttle bay
doors.
Decompression complete. Opening
main shuttle bay doors.
Good luck, Doctor.
We are in position, Doctor.
This is the only way to prove
they're harmless.
And if they are not?
I hate to keep reminding you,
but you are a machine. You'll
be perfectly safe.
That is by no means certain,
Doctor, but I was referring to
you.
Medical research is sometimes
a risky business, Commander.
It's all part of being human.
... Your name is Astarte... this
is your brother, David...
All within tolerance, Doctor.
The manufacturer will be pleased
to hear it.
I appreciate your help, but your
bedside manner needs work.
There was no warning.
Doctor!
Acute arthritic inflammation of
all joints. It's the initial
symptom of the disease.
Good lord!
The children must be returned
to their isolation environment.
Transporter set to original
coordinates, Captain.
Energize.
Glad you're here, Number One.
Thank you, Captain.
We'll have a medical team waiting
for you in the shuttle bay,
Doctor.
I'm afraid that's out of the
question. We still don't
understand what we're dealing
with. That means I'm subject
to the same quarantine as the
Darwin Station.
I recommend a delta-level
decontamination of the Sickbay
and the shuttle bay. Shuttle
One out.
Doctor!
Captain, I'll see to the
decontamination myself.
How do you feel?
Not exactly up to factory specs.
The pain is tolerable, thank you.
Set course for Darwin Station?
We're already quarantined. What
do we have to lose?
I wish it were that simple, Will.
A meaningless detail on a medical
form...
I agree it seems insignificant,
You have the authority to
countermand it.
My authority flows from the chain
of command. If you, or any other
officer, have anything less than
full confidence that your orders
will be carried out, then my rank
of Captain is meaningless.c
Sir, if there's any way I can
help get them back...
Of course.
Captain, Shuttle One is decending
to Gagarin Four.
Thank you, Mister Crusher.
The medical emergency at Darwin
Station is ongoing. We'll
continue to assist, but our
immediate concern is the
evacuation of our two officers.
Anyone?
Shouldn't Kate be involved in
this?
Judging from what we saw on the
Lantree, Doctor Pulaski may not
be able to help herself.
I suggest transporting them both
back to the ship. We should use
whatever time we have to seek
the best medical resources
available.
The transporter won't protect
us. The children went through
the transporter and still
infected Doctor Pulaski.
The bio-filter can be adjusted.
We could alter the filter to
screen out whatever it is that's
causing...
Precisely. We can't protect
ourselves against the unknown.
What we need is a filter that
isn't bio-dependent.
What about the "trace?"
The transporter trace?
The transporter keeps a computer
record of every transmission,
a footprint if you will. Usually
it's only stored for security
purposes, but if we used the
trace data to control the
reconstitution process...
Is that possible?
I hate to admit it, but it never
occured to me. All I can tell
you is she hasn't been wrong yet.
Very well. Thank you Ensign... ?
Excuse me, Captain. But where
will we get the trace data? As
far as I know Kate's never used
the transporter.
Never?
She's... a woman of strongly held
opinions, sir.
What about a previous assignment?
Her last ship was the Repulse.
Bridge. Signal the USS Repulse
on the sub-space captain's
priority channel.
Doctor Pulaski...
I can only tell you how much I
regret the burden we have imposed
on you.
On both of you.
Commander Data is an android,
Doctor. He is unaffected. As
for me, this was my choice, not
yours.
I still can't believe the
children had anything to do with
this.
The evidence is fairly
conclusive.
But the children were designed
to ward off any disease agents.
I think it's time we talked about
that.
Our ultimate achievement.
Genetically... engineered...
Created!
Perfect in every way. Better
than perfect. Their bone
structure, their musculature...
their brains!
What about their immune system?
That was our masterpiece. An
aggressive immunity that attacks
any invader and destroys it
genetically.
That's it.
Thelusian flu!
Thelusian flu?
The first officer of the Lantree
had Thelusian flu -- an airborne
virus.
How would their immune system
react to it?
By altering the genetic pattern.
Forcing the virus into
extinction.
I'm afraid that's what's
happening to us.
We were so concerned about
protecting them -- we overlooked
the obvious!
The one decision we made with
our hearts... turns out to be
a mistake.
Sorry, Picard. We purged the
Doctor Pulaski's trace right
after her transfer. Not that
she used the transporter much,
she preferred using the
shuttlecraft.
I'd have given her a shuttle if
it would have kept her here.
Best CMO I ever served with.
Tell me, Taggart. If she served
you as well as you say, why did
you let her go?
I guess you haven't run into her
stubborn streak.
The moment she heard of the
opening on the Enterprise, she
put in a request for transfer.
Knew your service record backward
and forward. Apparently she's
been an admirer of yours for some
time.
Extraordinary.
He's is trying to isolate the
altered genetic pattern.
But the computer run could take
months.
Not necessarily. Commander
Data... has a way with computers.
Comparing genetic samples
indicates a transposition of
these two proteins.
It appears that the antibodies
have been too effective.
What do you mean?
I believe she is referring to the
fact that the human genome is
self replicating.
He's quite right. Every cell
in our bodies is now programmed
for extinction.
Have you made any progress,
Doctor Pulaski?
The Darwin staff has amassed some
amazing new data on the
physiology of aging --
I'm sure, but right now I'm
concerned about you.
We've isolated the altered DNA,
but the process may not be
reversible. The others are
already at work in the primary
lab -- where I should be.
No, Doctor. You and Commander
Data belong here.
Commander Data is preparing to
leave now.
Doctor...
Jean-Luc... I appreciate what
you're trying to do.
But I got into this by leaping
before I looked, and I won't
allow you to make the same
mistake.
It's still my responsibility,
and the quarantine is still
valid.
I'm afraid this is the moment
of truth.
Chief Medical Officer Pulaski's
final report to the Enterprise...
Just as changes in evolution are
known to be caused by changes
in the environment, we now have
evidence that the process also
works in reverse.
The quarantine of the Darwin
Station must be maintained until
the end.
Pulaski out.
I am sorry I could not be more
helpful, Doctor Pulaski.
You did everything you could,
Commander.
As androids go, you're in a class
by yourself.
Doctor --
Please give my best to the
captain.
Enterprise. Commander Data ready
to beam aboard.
Sir. Commander Data is back
aboard.
Jean-Luc, don't try to carry all
the weight for this tragedy.
Kate knew what she was doing.
If I was certain we had tried
absolutely every --
Stand by.
No life forms present.
Good to see you, Data.
Yes, sir.
Tell me quickly -- you were
unaffected because you have no
genetic material?
Correct, sir.
And Doctor Pulaski's DNA is
altered -- and that's what brings
on the aging?
Precisely. An almost
undetectable transposition in
the human genome. It takes a
number of interactions of the --
Come on. We've got one more card
to play.
Sir?
Ensign, I need your opinion.
Sir?
You said the transporter could
be altered to filter out changes
in Doctor Pulaski.
If we'd had the trace...
Well it turns out the changes
are in her DNA. If we used a
sample of the doctor's DNA --
say from a blood test -- that
was taken before --
Could we filter out her genetic
alterations? Absolutely!
You're picking up some bad
habits, Ensign, but yes, you took
the words right out of my mouth.
Can you make the modifications?
Of course!
Make it so.
Hop to it Ensign. You've got
work to do.
Darwin Station, this is the
Enterprise.
We may have come up with an
answer, Doctor. We're looking
for a sample of your normal DNA
to use as a filter. We think
we'll be able to transport you
while cancelling out any changes
that have taken place.
An interesting idea, Captain.
But what about Doctor Mandel and
her colleagues?
Kate.
If this works -- we may be able
to use the same technique to save
ourselves. We have DNA samples.
A blood test or tissue specimen
-- anything that would provide
a sample of Pulaski's original
DNA.
Afraid not, sir. Her records
were shipped by way of Starfleet
headquarters. They haven't
caught up with us yet.
This is ridiculous.
A single cell! A single --
This is an emergency! Unlock
Medical Officer Pulaski's
quarters!
Riker, William T., relieved of
active duty on
two-three-four-six-nine-point-seven...
Allow me, sir.
Anything! Even a fingernail
clipping!
Or a hair!
Doctor... you should know. This
has never been done before. Are
you willing to chance it?
I'll tell you one thing. If I
live through this...
I'll have a much better
understanding of geriatrics.
Standing by, Captain.
Ready, Captain.
The isolation forcefield is in
place.
I'll operate the transporter
myself.
That's not necessary, sir.
I'm afraid it is. If something
should go wrong. If Doctor
Pulaski is not fully... restored.
Then she's still capable of
contaminating the ship.
In that event there should be
time to redirect the transporter
and... disperse her. It's not
a responsibility I can delegate.
Don't worry, Captain. It's not
going to come to that.
You seem to have absolute faith
in the ensign's work.
Like I said, she's never wrong.
Very well, then.
Engage forcefield.
Doctor Pulaski, are you ready?
I suppose I --
Captain...
Welcome aboard, Doctor.
Doctor... I'm ready to take the
Rheinman test.
Glad you reconsidered, Commander.
This is Chief Medical Officer
Pulaski. Commander Riker is
restored to active duty effective
immediately.
My schedule's a little tight.
What do you say we put it off
for a day or so?
Captain... If this hadn't
worked? If...
It would have been necessary to
beam your energy into empty
space.
Happily, there's no reason to
concern yourself with --
Why should I be concerned about
having my atoms spread across
the galaxy? I imagine that's
what's going to happen every time
I use the damn thing.
Looks like you'll be going to
your next assignment with a
captain's commendation in your
record.
Thanks to you. And the way
you... see things.
Tell me. When you look at me,
what do you see?
To me beauty is a constantly
changing thing. Sometimes people
have it and sometimes they don't.
It all depends on their energy.
I see your energy and it's
beautiful. But it comes from
within.
You're the only poetic chief
engineer I've ever heard of.
And you're the most able trainee
I've ever met.
To quote our first officer, "It's
been a pleasure."
Technically, I'm off duty.
Technically, so am I.
Maybe you'd like to come in.
I've got a fabulous collection
of antique star drive drawings.
Sounds riveting.
Course and speed set for Star
Station India, Sir.
Engage.
