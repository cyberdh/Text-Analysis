We are losing containment in the
starboard nacelle tube --
Try to get more power to the field
coils.
Yes, sir.
Geordi, report.
I can't shut down the plasma
injectors -- someone's locked out
the controls.
The plasma venting system has
engaged.
Two more decks --
Riker to Bridge -- we've almost
reached the nacelle tube.
Acknowledged.
Release the exterior hull plate.
We may have to jettison the core.
What happened?
He locked out the controls...
before we knew what was happening,
he stepped up onto the walkway.
See if you can shut down the
plasma flow.
I'm afraid if we try to get any
closer, he'll jump through the
forecefield.
Dan...
It's me... Wil Riker.
I was here yesterday, remember?
I didn't... want to do it...
but... I saw them... and... they
laughed at me... they laughed...
Whatever happened, we can talk
about it. I want to help.
Stay away!
I want you to be able to see me,
that's all... so we can talk.
I... know... what I have to do...
Dan, wait --
I have unlocked the controls --
Shut down procedure initiated.
There's still plasma in the
injector -- it'll take time to
vent off...
Tell me what happened. Maybe I
can help.
I know what I have to do...
A few more seconds and we could've
saved his life...
Commander... you did everything
you could. It was not your fault.
I had the strangest feeling
that... he didn't even recognize
me -- and I was with him just the
other day when I supervised the
tube refit.
How did he seem then?
Fine. In fact I complimented him
for getting the refit done faster
than expected. He was pleased
that I noticed.
I met with him during crew
evaluations about six weeks ago.
He was very positive; he was
looking forward to being posted to
the nacelle tube.
He was a fine officer, with a good
career ahead of him. I just don't
understand why he would want to...
In my years as a Starship Captain,
I've had to notify many families
that they'd lost a loved one. But
never to suicide. I'd like to be
able to offer Lieutenant Kwan's
family some explanation for what
happened -- to help them make
sense of it.
He may have left a message of some
kind, explaining why he did it.
I want the two of you to try and
piece together a picture of his
last few days.
If he made any personal logs, it
might be helpful to go through
them.
You're authorized to do so.
La Forge to Captain.
Go ahead.
I've completed a damage
assessment. We should be able to
get underway within the hour.
Geordi, the medical situation on
Barson Two has worsened --
Starfleet has given us permission
to exceed warp speed limitations
so we can get back on schedule.
We'll be able to give you warp
eight if you need it.
Acknowledged.
Geordi, would you agree that the
instinct for self-preservation is
shared by most life forms?
I'd say it's probably the most
basic instinct.
That being the case, I am having
difficulty understanding why
someone would deliberately
terminate their own existence.
I don't know, Data. All I can
think is that maybe Lieutenant
Kwan felt like there was
something... wrong in his life,
something he felt powerless to
fix.
I believe I understand. I have
been in a similar situation.
Really?
The first months following my
activation were a difficult period
for me... there were many
problems associated with my
becoming sentient.
Because your neural net was still
forming.
As I acquired new skills, neural
pathways would form and take the
place of other, less complex
pathways. It was very...
disorienting.
Sure sounds like it.
As my systems grew in complexity,
it became increasingly difficult
to integrate new pathways into my
existing neural net. The
probability of cascade failure
grew with each added pathway. I
came to the conclusion that it
would be easier and safer to shut
myself down and start again.
But if you did that, you wouldn't
have remembered any of the things
that had happened to you.
In a way, it would have been
like... committing suicide.
So what did you do?
I decided against the procedure.
I chose instead to treat the
problems I was having with my
systems as... challenges to be
overcome, instead of obstacles to
be avoided.
That's a great way of looking at
it. It's too bad Lieutenant Kwan
wasn't able to look at his
problems the same way.
I've gone over Kwan's personnel
records -- he had an exceptionally
stable psychological profile.
When we were in the control room,
it seemed as if he were trying
to... explain something he'd
done... something terrible.
He'd been on the Enterprise over
two years. No one has ever
reported an altercation with him.
These were his quarters.
This is a Napean design...
His mother is Napean; his father's
human.
Everything looks so... normal.
For some reason I was half
expecting to find the place a
mess.
Yes... it is strange to think that
someone could be considering
ending his life and yet not give
any outward sign of it.
Right before he jumped, he seemed
almost... calm.
He must have been in a lot of pain
to do what he did. It could be
that the prospect of ending that
pain felt like a great relief.
This is Ensign... Calloway, isn't
it?
She is a medical technician in
Sickbay.
It's always hard to lose someone
you care about... but to lose them
like this...
We should start going over his
logs...
This is his last entry; he made it
before going on duty this morning.
Personal log, Stardate 47622.1.
We finally finished the nacelle
tube refit last night. After
pulling two double shifts in a
row, I'm really looking forward to
spending some time with Maddy.
Ensign Calloway...
That doesn't sound like a man
planning on ending his life.
No... it does not...
I can't believe he's really
gone... I keep thinking he's
going to show up and tell me
there's been some terrible
misunderstanding...
I thought you might like to know
that in his personal logs, Dan
talked about you a great deal. He
loved you very much.
If that's true... then how could
he... leave me like this?
That's what I'm trying to find
out. I know it's hard to talk
about right now... but it would be
very helpful if you could tell me
a few things about him.
When was the last time you saw
him?
Two nights ago... we were planning
our next shore leave together.
Did he mention anything that
happened recently... anything that
might have upset him?
No, not really... he did say
something about work, about
Lieutenant Nara, but it wasn't
anything serious.
Nara... she's his superior officer
in the nacelle tube.
Yes. Dan sensed that she... well,
that she felt threatened by him --
that she thought he was after her
position.
Was he prone to mood swings, or
depression?
No... but he was very sensitive to
other people's moods.
What do you mean?
Sometimes he would just... look at
me, and know what I was feeling --
I always loved that about him.
Napeans are partially empathic --
he may have inherited some of his
mother's abilities.
He used to tease me that when I
met her, I wouldn't be able to get
away with anything.
Dan and I knew each other for over
two years, but we didn't really
get together until a few months
ago. We took it slow...
We thought we had all the time in
the world...
Something must've happened to him,
Counselor. Something terrible
Because it's not like Dan to take
his own life. Please... find out
what it was.
I'm sorry --
I didn't see you there...
You're Lieutenant Nara, aren't
you?
Can I do something for you,
Counselor?
I'm investigating Lieutenant
Kwan's death. I just wanted to
take a look around.
It's such a shame. He was a good
man.
Did you notice any change in his
behavior recently?
No... I've been going over the
last few days in my mind, trying
to see if I missed any... warning
signs. It's as if something in
him just... snapped.
How was his job performance?
Excellent. He knew this ship
better than most people --
probably because he helped build
it back at Utopia Planitia.
Did he get along with his coworkers?
He was... ambitious. He came in
here with all sorts of new ideas
about how to do things -- some of
them very good ideas.
But not all?
No. But once he settled in, we
got along fine.
Excuse me for a minute. Feel free
to look around.
Where was Lieutenant Kwan's
station?
Right down there.
Are you all right?
I... don't know...
I don't know how to describe it...
I was suddenly overwhelmed by a
flood of emotions -- fear, rage,
panic.
Whose emotions? I thought you
said you were alone.
I was. The sensations didn't seem
to be coming from any one person --
they were just there, in the room.
I scanned the area -- I picked up
no anomalous readings.
How could you be getting an
empathic impression from an empty
room?
I don't know...
Could the fact that Kwan was
partially empathic have something
to do with it?
What do you mean?
I'm not sure... but the feelings
Troi described certainly seem
consistent with suicide.
Could his death have left some
sort of... empathic echo?
I suppose it's a possibility...
but I don't see how.
If I went back to the nacelle
tube, I might be able to get a
better sense of what I
experienced.
I'm not sure that's a good idea --
you're showing elevated levels of
psilosynine.
Psilosynine?
A neuro-transmitter involved in
telepathy.
The experience overwhelmed you the
first time. I don't think you
should go back until the levels
return to normal.
How long?
Three, maybe four hours.
Next time I want someone with you.
I will accompany you, Counselor.
Captain's Log, Stardate 47623.2.
We've arrived at Starbase Three-twenty-eight
on schedule. After
taking aboard medical supplies, we
will depart for Barson Two.
-- I ran into Maddy yesterday. We
stood in the corridor and talked
for almost an hour... The more I
get to know her, the more I
realize what a remarkable woman
she is...
Come in.
Hello, Worf.
Counselor...
Have you found anything in
Lieutenant Kwan's logs?
Everything I've seen indicates he
was well-adjusted and optimistic.
Were you able to talk with Ensign
Trake?
Yes... I interviewed all of Kwan's
co-workers.
From what I've read, Trake was his
best friend.
He observed nothing that indicated
Kwan was contemplating ending his
life. Nor did any of the others.
It just doesn't make any sense...
Can I get you anything?
No, thank you.
Yridian tea...
I've been thinking about what
happened to me in the nacelle
tube... whether it was an empathic
echo left by Kwan's death...
In the past, have your empathic
experiences always involved the
physical presence of another
person?
All the ones I'm sure of, yes.
What do you mean, sure of?
Well... when I was a young girl,
my Grandfather used to tell me
stories by the fire... I would
close my eyes and listen to his
mind for hours on end...
He told you these stories
telepathically... ?
My grandfather rarely spoke out
loud... He said that was for off-worlders
who didn't know any
better.
The only time I can remember his
stories is when I go home... and
sit by the fireplace. Sometimes
when I'm there, alone... it's
almost as if I can hear his voice
in my head.
Yes... I have sought visions in
fire.
I can't explain it, but it felt
very real to me. Just like what
happened in the nacelle tube.
There are things we do not
understand, yet they exist
nonetheless.
I keep thinking about Ensign
Calloway... she needs to know
what happened to Kwan -- it's the
only way she'll ever be able to
put his death behind her.
This must be a very difficult time
for her.
Do you know what she regrets most?
That she and Kwan didn't take full
advantage of the time they had
together... they knew each other
for a long time, but they didn't
get together until recently.
She wishes they had acted on their
feelings sooner... ?
Perhaps I should let you rest.
It's all right --
If you will excuse me, Counselor.
Worf...
Commander...
Two Til'amin froths, please.
Lieutenant Corell seems to be
enjoying your company.
I'd like to think so.
Are you... involved with her?
I'm not sure yet.
Why do you ask? Are you
interested in her?
No...
But if I were, I would of course
discuss the situation with you
before proceeding further.
I appreciate the thought, but you
really wouldn't have to do that.
I would never want to come between
you and anyone you were involved
with... or had ever been involved
with.
Is there... someone in particular
you're talking about?
No. Is there... someone in
particular you would prefer I not
become involved with?
Worf... you sound like a man
asking a friend if he can start
dating his sister.
No, I am merely... never mind.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you open this door for me?
Yes, but only for a short time.
After ninety seconds the plasma
venting system will engage to
prevent degradation of the
forcefield.
I just want to take a quick
look...
May I ask what you are looking
for?
I'm... not sure...
Warning -- plasma venting system
will engage in ninety seconds.
No... please... don't...
Plasma venting system will engage
in... eighty seconds.
Worf... ?
Worf, where are you?
Counselor... are you all right --
Get me out of here...
Do you remember anything else?
I saw a tool crate on the floor...
it was labeled Utopia Planitia.
The shipyard where the Enterprise
was built.
Clearly this was much more than an
empathic echo. It seems that you
were actually seeing something
that happened in the control room
eight years ago.
Everyone was looking directly at
me. It's almost as if... I were
seeing through someone else's
eyes.
Lieutenant Kwan was partially
empathic...
Maybe you were seeing through his
eyes?
It's a possibility... but I don't
understand how it could have
happened.
Let's put that question aside for
a moment and assume that by some
unexplained phenomenon, you
witnessed an event that may have
involved Lieutenant Kwan.
The faces you saw -- did you
recognize them?
I don't think I've ever seen the
woman before, or the man who was
with her. But there was someone
else there. A man... he was
staring at me in the most peculiar
way. I think he had... reddish
hair. He seemed familiar to me...
but it's all so hazy, like trying
to remember a dream.
The woman seemed terrified of
something... then you saw her
again, laughing -- presumably at
Lieutenant Kwan.
What could it all mean?
I don't know. But something
terrible happened in that room.
I felt it.
Counselor... I want you to look
over the personnel files from
Utopia Planitia and see if you can
identify the faces you saw.
If only there were some way I
could go back to the control room
and not be overwhelmed by the
experience -- it might help me
remember some detail that could be
relevant.
I could give you an inhibitor that
would slow your brain's production
of psilosynine. That would
probably suppress your empathic
abilities enough to make the
experience manageable.
I'd like to try.
Very well, Counselor.
It'll take about sixteen hours to
synthesize the inhibitor.
I apologize for being late. The
viral medicines we are
transporting to Barson Two require
special security measures to
insure they are properly
contained.
Have you found anything?
No... there were literally
thousands of people involved in
building the Enterprise.
Perhaps if you found a way to
narrow the search parameters.
I think I have. The man who
seemed familiar to me may have
been on board the Enterprise
during the last seven years. I've
asked the computer to limit its
search to personnel who've served
at Utopia Planitia and on the
ship.
Ensign Salvatore... he transferred
off the Enterprise last year.
Lieutenant Ziff... she's in
quantum mechanics.
That's him.
Lieutenant Walter Pierce...
I remember now... he came aboard
about six months ago. I think
he's in Engineering.
You were Lieutenant Kwan's
supervisor at Utopia Planitia.
That's right. I was sorry to hear
what happened...
Did you spend time in the nacelle
control room while it was under
construction?
I worked all over the ship. In
fact, I remember running a power
conduit right behind that wall
there.
Were you ever in the nacelle room
at the same time as Lieutenant
Kwan?
It was a long time ago... people
were working all over the place.
So you do not remember?
I'm sorry, I don't.
Do you recall if anything...
unusual happened there?
How do you mean?
An altercation, perhaps. Possibly
involving Lieutenant Kwan.
No... nothing like that. The way
I remember it, things went pretty
smoothly.
What's this all about? If you
don't mind my asking.
Not at all. You see, when I went
into the nacelle room, I had an...
empathic experience.
We believe she may have been
seeing some event that occurred
there eight years ago.
And -- I saw you there.
Do you have any idea why that
might be?
I'm afraid I don't.
Lieutenant... you're probably
aware that I can sense whether
someone's telling the truth.
I've heard that.
I'm sure, then, that if you were
to... remember anything that might
be relevant to our investigation,
you'd contact me.
Of course.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Counselor...
The strange thing is I couldn't
read him at all.
But you implied that you could...
We have played poker together many
times. I have never known you to
bluff.
Well... it wouldn't be much of a
bluff if you knew, would it?
The fact that I couldn't read him
suggests that he has at least some
telepathic ability...
But Pierce is human.
That's what I don't understand...
Even though I couldn't read his
emotions, it did seem to me that
he was... holding something back.
Yes. I thought so as well.
Maybe we should try to access the
Engineering Logs from Utopia
Planitia. We might find out more
about him.
There might be something in them
about Lieutenant Kwan, as well.
It looks like it'll take about
half an hour for the transmission
to be completed.
Perhaps we should continue in the
morning... ?
It is late.
Yes, you must be tired.
A little...
Well. I will say good night.
Good night.
We should get an early start
tomorrow.
Yes. We should.
See you in the morning...
Yes...
Deanna...
Hello...
Breakfast is ready...
Mmm... that sounds good...
But it can wait...
Why didn't we do this a long time
ago... ?
Crusher to Counselor Troi.
Yes, Doctor.
I've synthesized the inhibitor;
you can come to Sickbay whenever
you're ready.
Acknowledged.
Crusher to Lieutenant Worf.
Worf, here.
The medical supplies are ready to
be taken to the cargo bay for
transport.
I will be there shortly.
There... you should start feeling
the effect immediately.
How completely will it suppress my
empathic abilities?
It's hard to say for sure... I can
raise the dosage if you find it's
not enough.
-- the cargo bay will be off-limits
to all but medical
personnel.
Thanks for your help, sir.
Good morning.
Counselor...
Data and Geordi are already in the
nacelle room. Are you ready?
Excuse me, sir. About the
quarantine field in the cargo
bay...
Yes.
It looks like we're going to need
a second field generator.
I am needed here. I will join you
as soon as I can.
All right...
Counselor, you okay?
I'm fine. The inhibitor seems to
be working.
Have you found anything?
Nothing unusual.
I don't remember seeing this
console during my empathic
experience. Has it been here
since the ship was built?
No, we installed it about two
years ago.
I remember seeing some sort of
power conduit...
Right there.
The main ODN line runs right
behind that panel... it lifts out
so you can get to it.
Kwan was working on that conduit
the day before he died.
Can you open it?
Sure... it'll just take a minute.
Lieutenant... the work Lieutenant
Kwan was doing, was it unusual in
any way?
He was refitting a field coil.
But it was probably the first time
that particular panel's been
opened since the ship was built.
Let's set it down right here...
Counselor?
Are you all right?
Something happened... when you
took off the panel...
There must be something there...
I am picking up readings that
indicate there is organic material
imbedded in the wall...
Organic material?
You're right... let me reconfigure
the emitter beam. We might be
able to see what it is...
There...
This dosage should prevent any
further empathic flashes.
The bone fragments are definitely
human... I sequenced a DNA sample;
I'll see if I can match it to
Starfleet records.
I'd say these fragments had been
in the wall about seven or eight
years.
You said something happened when
the panel was opened...
Yes...
I wonder if the fragments
themselves could've somehow
triggered your experience. I'll
run a resonance scan, see if
anything turns up.
Sir, I think we've found a
match...
Apparently the remains are those
of an Ensign Marla Finn --
I'm trying to find a picture of
her in the records...
That's her. That's the woman I
saw.
She was reported missing from
Utopia Planitia on Stardate
40987.2. Eight years ago...
How could her body have ended up
embedded inside a bulkhead... ?
Maybe there was some kind of...
accident.
Or she was killed. And the
murderer hid her remains.
Something's not right... pull up
Lieutenant Kwan's service record.
I thought so... he didn't arrive
at the shipyard until six months
after Finn's death.
I couldn't have been seeing
through his eyes...
Then whose... ?
It had to have been someone who
was at least partially telepathic.
Pierce... ?
But you saw him there.
Yes, but not as clearly as I saw
everything else... his face
looked...
Like that.
A reflection...
I was seeing through his eyes.
And Finn was trying to get away
from him; she was afraid of him...
I think it is time we had
another... conversation with
Lieutenant Pierce.
Ensign Calloway...
Thank you for your help.
Deck ten.
Worf... I want to ask you
something...
Do you regret what happened last
night?
No... of course not.
Are you sure? Because I don't
want anything to jeopardize our
friendship.
Deanna... I do not regret being
with you.
Is something wrong?
I just... don't feel myself.
Maybe it's the inhibitor -- I'm so
used to sensing what people are
feeling... now I can't.
Perhaps I should talk to
Lieutenant Pierce alone.
That might be a good idea...
I will meet you in your quarters.
I'll be waiting for you...
Deck eight.
Come in.
Security to Counselor Troi's
quarters.
Acknowledged.
I don't understand... Lieutenant
Worf said you wanted to talk to me
about something.
Where is he?
He said he had to go somewhere.
Troi to Worf.
Computer...
Where is Lieutenant Worf?
Lieutenant Worf is in Ensign
Calloway's quarters.
Take Lieutenant Pierce to his
quarters and hold him there.
Security override, authorization
Troi Delta-two-nine.
Worf...
Stop it --
Stop it --
He's dead... you killed him...
No... no...
You know what you have to do...
I know... what I have to do...
Plasma venting system will engage
in... seventy seconds.
What were you doing?
You're alive... you're all
right...
-- I opened the maintenance door
at Counselor Troi's request, then
turned and saw that she had moved
too close to the force-field.
It all seemed so real to me. It's
hard to imagine that everything I
experienced happened in just those
few seconds...
It appears that you were correct,
Counselor. Lieutenant Pierce was
partially telepathic -- his
maternal grandmother was from
Betazed.
What else have you found?
According to Starfleet records,
Pierce and the other two persons
Counselor Troi identified were
killed in an accidental plasma
discharge eight years ago. Their
bodies were never found.
I don't believe it was an
accident. I think that Pierce
found out that the other two were
having an affair. He lost
control... and killed them both.
Afterwards, he probably activated
the plasma stream, then threw
himself into it.
The plasma discharge would have
obliterated any evidence that it
was murder.
I scanned behind the panel
Counselor Troi asked me to look
at. I didn't find any bone
fragments... but I did find traces
of cellular residue. It's showing
some kind of... empathic
signature.
It may be that when Lieutenant
Pierce was struck by the plasma
stream, the subspace energy
present there imprinted his
empathic pattern into the residue.
Kind of like a... psychic
photograph.
That's what triggered my
hallucination... My mind must
have taken elements from my own
life and created a situation that
in many ways paralleled what
happened to Pierce.
If you hadn't been there, I would
have jumped... just like he did...
Counselor...
Yes?
When I pulled you away from the
plasma stream, you seemed...
surprised that I was alive.
Well... actually, in my
hallucination... you were killed.
May I ask by whom?
You know what they say, Worf...
Hell hath no fury like a woman
scorned...
