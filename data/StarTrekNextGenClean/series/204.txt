... and the hospital facility --
-- will stand there, facing north,
in that grove of trees.
The school and the arts center
will be here, centrally located
among the residential pods.
Looks good. At this rate you
should be ready for the next wave
of colonists in about six months.
I have to say I envy you... this
is a beautiful place to put down
roots.
Somehow, Commander... you don't
strike me as the kind that puts
down roots...
No? How do I strike you?
As... a free spirit. An
adventurer.
Ah. And aren't pioneers, like
you, adventurers at heart?
Of course. But we also have
this... nesting instinct. It's
exciting to find a new world --
but the joy comes in making it
a home. Building houses. Having
children. Roots.
Very interesting. I'd love to
discuss this further with you.
Dinner tonight?
If you want to share camp rations
in my tent -- I'd be delighted.
Haven't we managed to get a
replicator down here yet?
No, we haven't... but I've been
saving my ration of dried chicken
curry. It should go very nicely
with that bottle of wine I happen
to know you brought with you...
It's sounding better all the
time...
And as you know... I provide the
most memorable desserts...
My favorite part of dinner...
Will... Carmen...
We've been going over the
schematics for the hospital. The
location seems fine...
When the Enterprise comes back
tomorrow, we'll bring a crew
down here and get started.
Carmen... do you have some
construction started I don't know
about?
No... what is that?
Data?
I do not recognize the sound.
I believe the sound is coming from
above...
Will... what is it?
Maybe an atmospheric
disturbance...
Data -- what's our best bet for
cover?
There are subterranean caverns
beneath the hills to the east.
Approximately one kilometer.
Carmen, start rounding everybody
up.
But --
We've seen it before -- we know
what it is. Now get moving!
Let's go!
Beverly! This way!
Okay, people... stay calm... let's
go...
Follow him! Follow him! Go!
Let's go!
This way! Stay together!
Will... help us!
Carmen!
Captain... sensors are indicating
a disturbance near the outpost
on Melona Four.
What kind of disturbance?
I can't tell. We are still too
far away. It could be an
electrical storm...
See if you can make contact with
the colony...
Aye, sir.
How far are we?
At current speed, twenty-seven
hours.
Captain, I get no response from
Melona colony. But the
disturbance in the atmosphere is
increasing.
Bridge to La Forge...
La Forge here, Captain.
Are you picking up readings from
Melona?
Yes, sir. Something strange is
going on... there are violent
disruptions in the atmosphere...
Ensign... increase to warp eight.
Inside... keep moving, deep into
the cave...
How much protection will this cave
give us, Data?
The presence of refractory metals
in the rock formations may act
as an effective barrier.
Let's seal this entrance.
I hope there's enough air in here.
There should be a ventilation
source somewhere...
We need some light in here...
How are the others?
So far it looks like scrapes and
bruises. Will... where's Carmen?
Carmen didn't make it.
She went back for someone... a
man who'd fallen...
I'm sorry.
I think we'll be safe in here.
I'm not sure about our air supply.
Stay put and don't move around,
don't expend unnecessary energy.
With any luck we can wait this
out.
Riker to Enterprise... Riker to
Enterprise...
Commander, the refractory metals
in the rock strata might also
interfere with communication.
Data... we've only seen the
Crystalline Entity once before...
how do you know these metals will
protect us?
I am not entirely certain they
will.
That's what I was afraid you were
going to say...
Sir... the disturbance on Melona
is becoming more intense.
Continue hailing the colony.
All channels.
Captain... the fact that they're
not responding doesn't necessarily
mean there's anything wrong. The
atmospheric disturbance could be
jamming the signal.
I know, Counselor.
Still no response, sir.
Ensign, increase to warp nine.
How long, Mister Worf?
Six hours.
Commander... I have one man
unconscious. We can't stay in
here much longer...
If I open that entrance and it's
still out there, we're dead.
If we stay here we'll be dead...
It has been over an hour since
we heard the Entity. It may be
gone.
And it may be out there waiting
for us.
Everybody stay back.
Commander?
Lieutenant Worf... I don't think
I've ever seen a more beautiful
sight.
Good to see you're all right,
Commander. What's happened here?
The Crystalline Entity paid us
a visit. We lost two colonists
but got the rest in here...
Captain's log, stardate 45122.3.
We have notified Starfleet Command
of our intention to pursue and
investigate the Crystalline
Entity. To that end, we have been
joined...
... by Doctor Kila Marr, a
xenologist who has made studying
the Entity her life's work.
Welcome to the Enterprise. I am
Commander William Riker.
Commander... Kila Marr.
We're glad you're here.
You were on the surface... during
the attack.
That's right.
Remarkable. You and your group
are the only beings ever known
to survive an assault by the
Crystalline Entity.
We were lucky.
I should say.
And... your android. He was
there, too?
Lieutenant Commander Data was
there, yes.
Well. Shall we get started?
I'd be happy to show you to your
quarters --
Commander, the chance to talk to
survivors... this soon after an
attack... I've been waiting years
for this. I don't want to waste
a moment more.
... and when we came out of the
cave... there was nothing left.
Everywhere we looked... there was
just complete devastation... trees
gone... nothing...
That's typical. It could take
years for anything to grow again.
Doctor, I ran a full
spectrographic analysis, section
by section. Trace elements
confirm that it was the same
entity which destroyed the colony
on Omicron Theta.
The Crystalline Entity seems to
function like a giant
electromagnetic collector. It
needs a lot of power to keep
going... so it strips every form
of life from the worlds it
encounters and converts it all
into energy.
There was no vegetation left...
no insects. Not even soil
bacteria. It left nothing.
Except witnesses. For the first
time in eleven recorded attacks.
Why, I wonder... did it spare your
group?
It didn't spare everyone, Doctor.
If you'll check your reports,
you'll find that two of the
colonists didn't survive.
My point is that until now there
have never been any survivors.
Doctor, the cave in which we hid
was carved from rock which
possessed heavy concentrations
of kelbonite and fistrium. We
surmise that the Entity could not
penetrate that barrier.
I'd like to do interviews with
each of the survivors. Collect
as much specific detail as I can
of their observations.
Of course.
And I want to inspect the remains
of Melona Colony as soon as
possible.
Commander Data, you will accompany
the Doctor to the surface.
Yes, sir. We can leave --
If you don't mind, Captain, I'd
prefer to choose my own team.
There is no one on this ship who
is more knowledgeable of the
Crystalline Entity than Commander
Data. His birthplace was Omicron
Theta.
I am aware of his origins. I am
very much aware that his
"brother," Lore, worked with the
Crystalline Entity, and led it
to Omicron Theta -- where it
killed every living thing.
I don't think it's unreasonable
that I would prefer to make
another choice.
If there are others you wish to
have on your team, you are, of
course, welcome to request their
additional presence.
But as captain, I think it is in
the best interest of this
investigation for you and
Commander Data to work together.
As you wish, Captain.
Well?
I don't think you need an empath
to sense that woman's feelings.
There's hostility... that she
seems to have transferred from
Lore... to Data...
Perhaps you shouldn't have forced
her together with Data so soon.
If her discomfort is going to
cloud her judgement... or preclude
her doing her objective best...
I want to find it out now.
Doctor, there is evidence of
residual bitrious matter in the
soil. It was not present before
the Entity's attack.
Doctor Marr... you have made it
quite clear that you are disturbed
by my presence. However, I do
not believe that we can accomplish
the task we have been assigned
if you continue to ignore me.
Commander... I hear everything
you say to me. If there is
anything worth my response, you
can be sure I will not be silent.
Then I do not understand your lack
of interest in the bitrious
filaments I mentioned.
It's old news to me. I found
evidence of bitrium in three
separate attack sites. It seems
to be a residual element the
Entity produces after it absorbs
living matter.
I'm actually more interested in
this cave.
I'm still amazed that your group
was spared.
As I have speculated, the presence
of refractory --
-- refractory metals. Yes, I
know.
On two other occasions settlers
sought refuge in caves. Some of
them deeper underground than this
one. They perished anyway.
Were those caves laced with
kelbonite or fistrium?
The tunnels on Forlat Three had
strong deposits of kelbonite, yes.
Then perhaps it is the combination
of the two metals which prevented
the Entity --
Or maybe it was you.
I do not understand.
Maybe it was your presence which
made the Crystalline Entity pass
over the people in this cave.
Did that occur to you?
I cannot imagine what effect my
being here would have had --
If you had been in contact with
the Entity... if that's why Melona
was attacked... it surely wouldn't
have killed its -- ally.
You are suggesting I lured it
here?
Did you?
No, Doctor.
Ah. Because Lore betrayed the
colonists on Omicron Theta, you
assume that I am capable of the
same behavior. But you are
mistaken, Doctor. My programming
is distinctly different from
Lore's.
Don't you understand? I'm
accusing you of collaborating with
that monster...
I do understand. I am attempting
to explain to you that it is
impossible.
Amazing. You can't feel anything,
can you? Nothing I say to you
hurts you...
That is true.
I'm getting a slight elevation
of monocaladium particulates in
this cave wall... are you making
note of that?
Yes, Doctor.
My son died on Omicron Theta.
He was sixteen when the colony
was attacked.
That's the reason I became an
expert on the Crystalline Entity.
I've spent my life, studying it,
tracking it... hoping someday to
find it...
And if I learn that you are
helping that thing in any way
whatsoever... I'll see to it
that you are disassembled --
piece by piece.
Okay... we've input all the data
you collected on the surface...
Just a minute, Commander... I have
some cellulose readings from soil
samples that weren't included...
You handle that unit like a
veteran, Doctor.
One thing about spending your life
gathering information... you learn
your way around computers.
Hydrocarbons slightly elevated...
bitrious filaments in trace
amounts...
Lanthanides... nitrates... all
normal.
Nothing different. Everything
falls within the parameters I've
established at the other attack
sites.
Did you expect different results
this time, Doctor?
I've never surveyed a site so soon
after the attack. I thought maybe
I'd find something new. Something
that would make a difference...
Doctor... have you ever scanned
your samples for gamma radiation?
Why would I do that?
We are seeing high-energy
reactions that may show up in a
gamma scan...
... and if they do... we might find
a pattern -- a kind of marker the
Entity left behind. Good idea,
Data.
Frankly, I just don't see what
this will get us.
If the Entity left a residual
trace of antiprotons in the
samples we collected, the gamma
radiation scan would reveal that.
Data, I'm getting the readout now.
If we try a logarithmic scale,
it will give us better resolution.
There, Data... see it?
Yes.
Would you care to see what the
scan has produced, Doctor?
A sharp spike at ten KEV. And
another...
A pattern...
So we know the Entity leaves
antiprotons behind...
If it also deposits antiprotons
in space, as it travels... could
we detect them?
Sure. The ship's lateral sensors
can be set for gamma radiation.
Well. Let's get to it, shall we?
It seems I owe you thanks,
Commander.
The thanks actually go to Doctor
Clendenning on Omicron Theta who
did the first experiments with
gamma scans.
I've never read that... it wasn't
in any of his records...
That is correct. But I possess
much of his knowledge. He was
working with new detectors before
the attack on Omicron Theta.
I'd heard that you had been
programmed with the experiences
of the colonists... but frankly
it's a little hard to believe.
Bridge.
It is true, Doctor. The contents
of their journals and logs were
transferred into my memory cells.
The man who created me also
experimented with scanning the
synaptic patterns of the
colonists' temporal lobes and
programming them into my neural
nets.
You possess -- their thoughts?
To some degree. Doctor Soong
hoped to provide me with an
amalgam of the colonists'
memories.
Interesting.
There... a spike at ten KEV...
and again...
That's the same pattern we saw
in engineering.
Can you project a course from it?
Yes, sir.
There are two possible
destinations. The Brechtian
Cluster and the Argos system.
Is either populated?
The Brechtian Cluster has two
inhabited planets.
Ensign, set a course.
Captain, I've done some
preliminary estimates of the
firing pattern we'll need in order
to destroy the Entity. The photon
torpedoes will require some
reprogramming.
With your permission, I'll give
the calculations to Lieutenant
Worf.
Reprogram the torpedoes, Mister
Worf.
Let's just hope we don't have to
use them.
I beg your pardon?
If it's possible to avoid firing
on it, I would hope that --
You aren't going to kill it?
Perhaps you should join me in my
ready room.
I don't understand. Why are we
pursuing the Entity, if not to
destroy it?
We are not hunters, Doctor. Nor
is it our role to exact revenge.
What do you propose? We track
it down... greet it warmly... and
ask if it would mind terribly not
ravaging any more planets?
I'm not denying that it might
become necessary to fire on it.
But that would be a last resort.
Why? Why not just kill it?
I'm going to try to talk to it.
What?
We know through our own experience
that our shields will protect us
from the Entity. As long as we
are in no danger, I will make
every effort to communicate.
To what end?
If we can determine what its needs
are, we might find other sources
to supply it...
Its needs are to slaughter people
by the thousands... it's nothing
but a giant killing machine.
The sperm whale on Earth devours
millions of cuttlefish as it
prowls the ocean. It is not
evil... it is simply feeding.
The same may well be true of the
Crystalline Entity.
That would be small comfort to
those who have died to feed it.
We're not talking about
cuttlefish... we're talking
about people.
There are those, Doctor, who would
argue that the Crystalline Entity
has as much right to be here as
we do.
Mister Data has some theories
about how to communicate with the
Entity. Please confer with him.
Come in.
Am I disturbing you?
Not at all, Doctor.
Commander... there's something
I want to say.
You have been helpful to me, and
kind. I repaid you with
accusations -- and I realize I
may have been wrong.
It is gracious of you to say,
Doctor. But I have not been
injured by you.
Captain Picard has told me that
you have done work in trying to
establish communication with the
Entity.
That is true. I have experimented
with producing vibrations in
crystal by means of graviton
pulses.
Like tapping a crystal goblet?
Exactly.
I will call up the results I have
achieved so far and you can study
them.
All right.
Commander... just what kind of
memories do you retain... of the
colonists?
I do not possess the
minute-to-minute remembrances of
each person there... although
many of their more intense
recollections are contained in
my memory banks.
Do you... have any of my son's
memories?
Marr... Raymond... called Renny.
Yes. I do.
I see. And his journals?
Yes.
I was wondering... do you know...
... did he -- blame me?
Blame you?
For going away. For leaving him
on Omicron Theta.
I am not aware of any blame
against you.
I left him with friends... I chose
to pursue my career... I planned
to go back, but things kept
interfering... I kept thinking,
"I'll go next month... "
And then... there weren't any more
"next months."
I am unaware of any negative
thoughts he had about you.
His personal journals indicated
he was proud... that you were such
a fine scientist.
He was... ?
What else... do you know... ?
Commander Data, Doctor Marr,
report to the bridge immediately.
A distress call... from a ship
called the Kallisko... it's being
pursued by an unknown object.
... sensors indicate a crystalline
structure of indeterminate mass...
How strong are your shields,
Captain?
We are a transport ship -- our
shields are minimal...
Do you carry weapons?
Only low-level particle phasers...
Do you know what this being is?
Kallisko, change course, take
evasive action. Do whatever you
can to outrun it.
... we are under attack.
... notify our people on Boreal
Three --
Mister Worf... can you
reestablish?
No, Captain. There is no
response.
The Crystalline Entity is moving
away.
Set a course for the Kallisko.
Mister Riker, prepare an away
team... I want you to check for
survivors.
It was pretty much what we
expected, Captain. No
survivors...
Not a trace of anything that was
ever alive. Not even the seeds
in their greenery storage.
Warp and impulse engines are down
but they can be restarted. A
skeleton crew could take the ship
to a starbase.
We don't want to take the time
now. Send a message to the
nearest starbase to dispatch a
crew.
Aye, sir.
Mister La Forge, make certain we
are still picking up the gamma
radiation pattern of the Entity.
Yes, sir.
Have you and Commander Data made
any progress in finding a means
of communication?
I believe so. There are some
details to iron out --
Then please keep working. We
may need it soon.
Deck seventeen.
Doctor... you have seemed
preoccupied... since we surveyed
the Kallisko.
I've found you very easy to talk
to, Commander.
Do you mind if I tell you
something... ?
Not at all.
Hearing the screams of those
men... made it hard not to think
about my son... about what
happened to him.
I've read stories... about
soldiers on the battlefield...
wounded and dying... who call for
their mothers.
And I've always wondered...
... if my son called for me...
... if he died wondering why I
didn't come to him...
Come.
It's still headed toward the
Brechtian Cluster. We've
reestablished our course.
Very well.
One more thing...
Starfleet will notify Carmen
Davila's family of her death and
return her personal effects.
Would you care to include a
letter?
Yes, sir. I'd like that.
Something more, Number One?
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Of course.
I've been thinking... maybe Doctor
Marr is right. Maybe we should
destroy the Entity.
And why do you think that?
It's killed thousands. It will
undoubtedly keep on killing...
unless we stop it. I don't want
those deaths on my conscience.
Are you sure that's it? Or are
you being influenced by personal
feelings?
With all due respect, sir... I'm
not a raw cadet. I've lost people
on missions before.
Carmen was a good friend. But
that's not why I'm saying this.
If we take the time to try to
communicate with this thing, we
may lose our chance to destroy
it. And I don't think we can risk
that.
I'm going to write that letter
to Carmen's family.
We should program the bridge
science station to vary the
emissions we direct toward the
Entity.
I'll write a subroutine that will
allow us to change the frequency
of the graviton beam.
Data... you told me you carried
some of my son's memories...
That is true.
What can you tell me about Renny?
What were those thoughts? Was
he -- was he happy at all, on
Omicron Theta?
I possess some vivid memories of
sporting events... he played
Parrises Squares with a group of
his schoolmates...
Renny started Parrises Squares
when he was young... too young,
really... but the older children
kept asking him to join in and
I couldn't keep him away. He just
had this natural gift...
He was pleased to have won a
championship emblem.
I remember... he wrote me about
that... he was so proud...
I'm characterizing pulse width
in nanoseconds... sound right to
you?
Yes, Doctor.
Your son's most intense thoughts
seemed to revolve around a young
woman named Janina...
A girlfriend? I never knew about
that... of course, that would be
the last thing he'd tell his
mother... What was she like?
He enjoyed her... gentleness...
her kindness... her...
... her -- physical attributes...
There. Now we'll be able to vary
all the parameters directly from
the bridge.
Could you... do something for me?
It would mean a lot...
I would be happy to be of help.
You see... all I have left of
Renny, my only connection to
him... is there, inside you.
And I was wondering... if you
could talk to me in his voice.
I know you have the ability to
sound like other people. Isn't
that right?
Yes, that is correct. But what
would you want me to say?
Maybe... something from his
journals...
Many of his journal entries took
the form of letters to his
friends and family. I could
access one of those.
I took my last exam today... I
think I did all right on
everything except cellular
biology. I know you think it's
important, Mom... but I don't see
how I'm ever gonna use this stuff.
In a couple of weeks, a bunch of
us are going on an archaeological
dig in the mountains. The Wallaces
said it would be okay with them
as long as we have adult
supervision... so don't worry
-- they're watching out for me.
They're really great people...
I like them a lot.
But they're kind of serious...
They don't have your sense of
humor, Mom.
I miss you.
Captain's Log, stardate 45125.7.
We are still in pursuit of the
Crystalline Entity. Data and
Doctor Marr are prepared to
attempt communication with the
being when we intercept it. I
will admit to some uncertainty
about the prospect... it could
prove to be a scientific
triumph... or a catastrophe.
Sir, the Brechtian Cluster is now
five light years away.
Are we still picking up the
Entity's pattern?
Yes, Commander. But sensors do
not yet have a lock on its exact
whereabouts.
Captain, we are reasonably certain
it's between here and the
Brechtian Cluster. If I start
emitting the graviton beam now,
it may act as a lure... a kind
of beacon.
Make it so.
We'll start with a pulse width
of five nanoseconds, frequency
one pulse per second.
Commencing graviton emission
now...
No change in the sensor readings.
Let's ramp the frequency.
Emissions now at ten pulses per
second.
Sir...
What is it? Do you have
something?
A large mass... approaching at
warp speed...
Full stop. Doctor Marr, continue
emitting your signal. On screen,
Mister Worf.
Shields up.
It's beautiful...
Doctor... shall we change the
frequency?
Yes... yes, Commander. Proceed.
Changing to twenty pulses per
second...
What's it doing? Checking us out?
Possibly... just as we are
checking it out.
Is it... responding to us?
Let's test that. Ramp the
frequency again, Commander...
Emissions at thirty pulses per
second...
Captain, I'm reading a
transmission from the Entity...
a series of graviton pulses...
It's working... that's a response
to our signal...
Remarkable...
Captain, there is a pattern
emerging from its signals.
It's trying to communicate with
us?
I believe so... although it will
take some time to decipher the
patterns...
Then it's possible...
communication... understanding...
Let me try something else... a
continuous graviton beam.
Graviton pulses from the Entity
have stopped...
Maybe it doesn't like what we're
doing...
Return to the intermittent
signal, Doctor...
Doctor Marr?
Counselor... ?
Something's wrong...
Sir, the Entity is beginning to
resonate... vibrations
increasing rapidly...
Doctor, stop the transmission!
That is an order --
It's for you, Renny... I did it
for you...
Mister Worf, take charge of the
Doctor. Mister Data, shut down
that transmission.
Vibration amplitude is
increasing... it can't last much
longer.
I am unable to stop our graviton
signal, Captain. Doctor Marr
has isolated the access code.
Maybe I can create an override
sequence... shut it down from
here.
Resonance is approaching
critical...
I can override her program, but
it's gonna take time --
Mister Worf... escort Doctor Marr
to her quarters.
Yes, sir.
It will never hurt anyone again...
Captain... perhaps I should escort
Doctor Marr...
Fine. But do not leave her
unattended.
Doctor... if you will come with
me...
Of course.
I will stay with you, Doctor.
How long will you live, Data?
There has been no predetermined
limit placed on my existence.
I'm glad. As long as you're
alive... he'll be alive.
I need your help.
In what way, Doctor?
... like you did before... tell me
you understand, Renny... that you
know I did it for you, because
I love you... because I wanted
to give you peace, at last.
I do not find such a file in your
son's journals. However... from
what I know of him by his writing
and his memories, I do not believe
he would be happy. He was proud
of your career as a scientist,
and now you have destroyed it.
You say you did it for him, but
he would not want that. Yes.
He would be very sad now.
Does that help, Doctor Marr?
