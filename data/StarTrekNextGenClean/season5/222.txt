I like to cook all kinds of stuff.
Like yogurt and raisin salad...
chocolate-chip pancakes... and
purple omelettes.
Purple omelettes?
You put grape juice in the eggs.
Isabella doesn't like it very much
-- she says it tastes funny.
I can see her point...
Sugar with your tea?
Yes, please.
Isabella... would you like some
too?
Yes. But she takes two cubes.
I'll bet Isabella is very pretty.
She's very, very pretty. She has
blonde hair and a blue dress with
white buttons. Her ears are
pierced. And she's tall.
Maybe you could draw me a picture.
I'd love to see what she looks
like.
You don't think she's real.
I think she's real for you, Clara.
And that's real enough for me.
Honey, I think it's time for you
to go. You don't want to keep
Keiko waiting.
I have to go plant the nasturtiums
now.
I'm Keiko's helper in the
arboretum today.
Is that so?
Go ahead, Sweetie. Be home for
dinner.
I hope to see you soon, Clara.
Maybe we can be friends.
Okay.
Counselor Troi?
Yes?
Isabella says she likes you.
Thank you, Isabella.
I understand why you're
concerned... but you have nothing
to worry about. It's a normal,
healthy activity for children to
engage in imaginary play.
I'm just afraid she's not making
real friends. She spends all of
her time with "Isabella"...
You've been moving from starship
to starship since Clara was two
years old. Maybe Isabella
provides a constant companion for
Clara. She knows this is one
friend she won't have to leave
behind.
You're probably right.
Give Clara a chance. As she
learns to make friends on the
Enterprise, she'll probably move
away from her imaginary world.
Captain's log, stardate 45852.1.
The Enterprise has arrived at
FGC-four-seven -- a nebula which
has formed around a neutron star.
We are eager to investigate this
unique formation.
We've got elevated quantities of
hydrogen... helium... trionium...
but nothing the shields can't
handle.
Shields up.
Take us in, Ensign. One-quarter
impulse.
Aye, sir.
In order to complete the scheduled
observations, the lateral sensors
will require additional processing
time.
We could steal a couple of hours
while they're recalibrating the
thermal interferometery scanner.
Will a couple of hours be enough
time to complete the
high-resolution series on the
neutron star?
No problem. We'll just double
up the main sensor bandwidth.
After dinner, then what?
We went to the holodeck and took
a walk on the Champs Elysees...
The neural scanner still seems
a bit off. Let's check the sensor
calibration...
I'll run a diagnostic...
And... ?
And?
After Paris... ?
He has shore leave next month.
He asked me to go to Risa with
him.
No problem. Nurse Davila can
cover for you.
I don't know if I'm going, Doctor.
I hear it's a very uninhibited
atmosphere. Personally, I don't
think I'm ready for that kind of
"fun."
Try to talk him into Telana Minor
instead -- they've got a cruise
down the Jokri River... the
iridescent currents are beautiful.
See, Isabella... you have to push
your finger into the soil as deep
as you can.
The baby seeds are very small...
so we mustn't give them too much
to drink.
Hello? Is somebody there?
Hello.
Isabella?
Hello, Clara.
Isabella... How come I can see
you?
Is something wrong with the way
I look?
No. I've just never seen you
before. Not for real.
Well... now you can see me for
real. Doesn't that make you
happy?
Yes... it's wonderful!
Can we go now?
We should finish planting the
seeds.
I'm tired of planting. Let's do
something else.
Like what?
Like...
I would really like to explore
the ship.
We should finish planting first.
I promised Keiko.
We can finish later. Let's go
look around.
I'd better ask my daddy.
Your daddy won't mind. We can
tell him later. Come on...
So what are we going to name this
nebula? "FGC-four-seven" just
doesn't have a nice ring to it.
Why don't we call it... "Sutter's
Cloud?"
The rotational period of the
neutron star is one point three
five seconds.
That's a bit on the long side.
Sutter -- let's see if we can get
a reading on the particle flux.
Aye, sir.
I was thinking more along the
lines of "The LaForge Nebula."
Sounds sort of majestic, don't
you think?
Based on those selections, I would
prefer FGC-four-seven.
What was that?
It felt like we hit something.
Shields have registered an impact.
But the sensors show nothing in
the vicinity.
Forward velocity is down by point
two percent. And dropping...
Engineering. Report.
Could be a problem with the
shields, Captain. We're checking
it out now.
Systems are normal, sir.
So -- did we hit something or not?
Shields say yes, sensors say no...
this is very strange...
Ensign, give me a breakdown
on shield energy conversion.
Run a spectral --
Whoa. Where did you come from?
I'm Clara Sutter.
That's my daddy.
Clara, you can't be here right
now.
But Isabella wanted to see
engineering.
I don't care what Isabella wanted
to see. Go back to our quarters
right now.
But Daddy...
Bridge to LaForge. Our speed
is still dropping.
I'm increasing power to the
impulse engines... but forward
velocity isn't consistent with
engine output.
Explanation.
It looks like something is
increasing the drag coefficient
on the ship. But we can't find
the cause...
If you can't correct it... we're
going to have to reverse course
and leave the nebula.
Give me a couple of minutes,
sir...
Clara -- now.
Sorry, Commander.
Why do you keep disappearing like
that?
The grown-ups don't think I'm
real. When they're around, I have
to be invisible.
Wait here.
The drag coefficient continues
to increase. Forward velocity has
fallen by twelve percent.
Our speed is increasing...
The ship's speed has stabilized
at one-quarter impulse.
Great, Data. What'd you do?
I did nothing, Commander.
The problem seems to have
corrected itself.
Where did you go?
There was something I had to do.
I don't have an explanation, sir.
We seemed to hit something... and
then we started losing speed.
But so far as we can tell, there's
nothing out there to hit.
Could some kind of damping field
cause us to lose velocity?
We simulated several such fields,
but were unable to reproduce the
same drag coefficient.
We also don't know why the problem
suddenly corrected itself.
It seems we're observing a unique
phenomenon... one that hasn't
been recorded before.
The question is, do we stay here
and check it out?
That may be dangerous.
Since we have experienced the
phenomenon only once, it is
impossible to estimate the risks.
I'd like to stick around a little
longer, sir... collect a sample
of the gaseous matter, see what
it tells us...
Agreed. Collect your sample,
Mister LaForge. We'll proceed
-- with caution.
Dismissed.
What's in here?
That's the door to the cargo bay.
We can't go in there.
Let's go someplace with lots of
people.
Okay.
Isabella, why are you so serious
lately?
What do you mean?
You haven't even smiled once
today.
You're my best friend, Isabella.
Why?
I don't know. Because we do
things together... and we trade
secrets.
Does everybody have a best friend?
If they're lucky. Before I had
you, I didn't have one...
Why not?
Every time I made friends with
someone... my daddy's job would
change and we'd move to a new ship.
And it takes time to make best
friends...
How long?
It depends. With you... not very
long. You always listened to me,
even when I was sad...
Clara... I'm glad we're best
friends.
Race you.
Okay.
Ready... set ... go!
This area is not designated for
children.
Are you lost?
Where are you supposed to be?
We were only playing. We're
sorry.
Return to your quarters. And we
will forget this incident.
Thank you!
Okay... I've configured the
magnetic coils to collect gaseous
matter from the nebula. Go ahead
and activate the beam emitter.
I'm setting the fractionater to
a continuous cycle...
We'll take samples from eight
random sections. That should give
us a reliable measure.
Commander...
I understand... that you had a
parent in Starfleet.
Two of them, as a matter of fact.
My father was an exozoologist...
my mother a command officer.
They must have been posted to a
lot of different assignments...
That's putting it mildly. They
were always on the move... some
of the time together, some times
separately... I never knew if
I was going to be stationed with
my dad while he studied
invertebrates in the Modean
system... or with my mom on some
outpost near the Neutral Zone.
Was that hard on you?
I don't remember it that way...
But... it must have been
disruptive if you didn't stay
in one place long enough to make
friends...
I guess there were things about
my childhood that weren't ideal...
but to me, it was like one long
adventure.
Kids are tougher than you think.
As long as they know you love
them... they can handle just
about anything life throws at
them.
Thanks, Commander.
I see... a Samarian coral fish...
with its fins unfolded...
I believe what you are seeing is
the effect of the fluid dynamic
processes inherent to large scale
motion of highly rarified gas.
No... first it was a fish... now
I see a Mintonian sailing ship...
Where?
Right there -- see how the two
swirls come up to form a mast...
I do not see it.
It is interesting that people try
to find meaningful patterns in
things that are essentially
random. I have noticed that the
images they perceive can sometimes
suggest what they are thinking
about at that particular moment.
Besides, it is clear that this
cloud formation most closely
resembles a "bunny rabbit."
I think someone's lost her way...
Hello there. Are you looking for
someone?
No... I brought Isabella to see
Ten Forward.
Well, ordinarily you're supposed
to be here with a grown-up... but
since you've brought Isabella,
you can be my guest.
Thank you.
How about two glasses of Papalla
juice... with extra bubbles.
Yes, thank you --
Just one, please. Isabella isn't
thirsty.
One juice...
You're not like the other
grown-ups.
Oh, no?
They don't think Isabella's real.
Sometimes grown-ups have a tough
time believing in things they
can't see.
Why?
Well... they tend to get very
preoccupied with grown-up things.
Like what?
Oh... like figuring out how much
fuel it takes to power this
ship... or deciding whether to
explore one star system or
another... arranging schedules,
making lists, counting inventory,
or... wondering if little girls
should go to bed at seven... or be
allowed to stay up till eight.
Their heads can get so full...
that there's no room left for the
things you and I know are important.
Like invisible friends.
If nobody else understands... how
come you do?
Maybe because when I was your age,
I had an invisible friend, too.
You did? What was she like?
It wasn't a she.
What was he like?
It wasn't a he.
It?
It was a Tarcassian razor beast.
It had dark brown fur, gold
eyes... huge spiny wings... It
could fly so fast that no one
could see it... except me.
Sounds scary.
It was... especially when it
smiled.
But the best thing about it was
that I could curl up and lie on
its furry stomach. It had the
deepest, softest purr you've ever
heard... it put me to sleep
every night...
That razor beast was a good
friend.
So is Isabella.
Hello, Clara.
Hello...
I was just talking with Clara and
Isabella.
Clara... would you and Isabella
like to take a walk with me?
I guess so.
'Bye.
See you later, Clara...
Isabella.
Clara, you haven't been on this
ship very long, so maybe you don't
know that Ten Forward is usually
for grown-ups.
I know that. I didn't want to
go. But Isabella wanted to see
it.
If Isabella is telling you to do
things you know are wrong... then
you must tell her it's not
acceptable.
I tried to. But she wouldn't
listen.
Deck thirty-two.
Would you like me to talk to
Isabella for you?
Isabella... it's not very nice
to tell Clara to do things she
isn't supposed to.
She's over here.
From now on... I want you to ask
a grown-up before you go places
that are off-limits.
What did she say?
She said...
Clara. Please tell me what
Isabella said.
She said... you better leave us
alone.
I'm a little concerned about the
turn this is taking. It seems
Clara is starting to do
inappropriate things... and she's
blaming them on Isabella.
She came into engineering today...
and said it was Isabella's idea.
I don't think it's too serious
yet. But we should make more of
an effort to get her involved with
real friends her own age.
The Children's Center is having
a ceramics class this afternoon.
Why don't I take Clara?
I think she'd like that.
I'll see if there's room left in
the class. In the meantime, make
yourself available to Clara. Let
her know she doesn't have to rely
on Isabella when she needs someone
to talk to.
Thank you, Counselor.
Are you mad at me?
I'm sorry I got you in trouble.
That's okay.
Are we still... best friends?
Here -- you can help me put this
together, if you want.
Clara... Why are grown-ups so
mean?
They're not mean -- they're just
more serious than we are.
Sometimes I wish they'd just go
away.
You do?
Yes... I don't like them.
I'm bored. Let's go back to
engineering.
We're not allowed to go there.
I thought we were best friends.
We are.
Then why won't you play with me?
I told you...
You always listen to the
grown-ups. You don't care about
me.
That's not true.
I thought we'd have fun
together, once you could really
see me. I thought you'd like
me...
Let's go to engineering, Clara.
Just for a little while. No one
will know -- it'll be our secret.
And if they find us, we'll tell
them we got lost...
Who is it?
Counselor Troi.
Hello, Clara.
Hi.
I came to ask if you'd like to
come to a ceramics class.
Can Isabella come, too?
No, Clara. We'll do something
with Isabella another day.
Well...
Okay.
Sir, as we move deeper into the
nebula, sensors indicate that
levels of helium and trionium have
continued to rise steadily
Is it anything the shields can't
handle?
No, sir, we are well within
tolerance levels --
Mister Data -- ?
Shields have registered an impact,
sir...
But sensors don't show anything
out there, right?
No, sir. There is no indication
of anything near the ship.
Forward velocity is dropping,
Captain. Down by point-four
percent.
Can we go to warp speed?
Until we determine the cause of
the drag coefficient, I would not
recommend it, sir.
Forward velocity is down by one
point one percent.
Ensign, increase power to the
impulse engines.
Aye, sir.
Impulse engines are now at full
power.
We are no longer losing speed.
Forward velocity is holding
steady. The drag coefficient is
still present, but it has
stabilized.
Bridge to Commander Riker... check
with Mister LaForge... see if
he's found anything in that matter
sample from the nebula.
On my way, sir.
Any luck?
Yeah -- take a look at this...
We tried radiating the matter
sample with just about everything
we could think of. We didn't find
anything... until we subjected
it to a high frequency warp
field...
This may be what we've been
running into...
Do you know what it is?
We think so. Now that the sensors
can read it, it seems to be a
highly cohesive form of plasma
-- like a strand of energy.
We figure this segment is just
part of a network of much larger
strands.
When these things come in contact
with our shields, it produces a
resonant effect -- and creates the
drag coefficient we've been
experiencing.
Anything like this on record?
No.
Any idea how many more of these
there might be?
No. But if we run the warp field
generators through the deflector
grid, we could radiate a field
outside the ship.
... and we'd see for ourselves.
Let's do it.
Aye.
Alexander, I thought you might
like a partner.
This is Clara Sutter. She's new
on board. Clara, meet Alexander
Rozhenko.
I'm making a cup for my father.
Wanna help?
It's alright...
You gotta put them all in a row...
like this...
Clara, would you like some clay
of your own?
I've never made a cup before.
How do you do the round part?
It's easy. Just take a big piece
of clay, and push your hand into
it...
Warp field generators are standing
by.
Captain -- we should be able to
illuminate any strands within two
thousand kilometers of the ship.
Proceed.
Initiating field generation...
Remarkable...
It is an irregular lattice
composed of approximately
forty-seven million strands of
energy.
Captain -- with this many out
there, the resonant effect on
our shields could cause a
problem...
Agreed. Ensign -- bring us about
and take us out of the nebula.
That may be difficult, sir.
I am now detecting a significant
number of strands behind us.
Do your best, Ensign.
Aye, sir.
Hot chocolate.
Computer -- list my appointment
schedule for next week.
Kryonian Tigers aren't so scary.
I saw one once.
You did?
My father took me to the zoo on
Brentalia. All the tiger did
was lick my hand. And he smelled
funny.
I think we need more water.
I'll get some.
Isabella?
Clara!
I didn't do it.
Then who did?
It was Isabella.
I don't see anybody.
She's invisible.
I worked two weeks on this. That
was really mean.
I didn't do it! I didn't!
There's no such thing as invisible
people. You're lying!
Hey!
Isabella, STOP!
Clara...
Why are you being so mean to me?
Why'd you do that to my friend?
Because you ran away from me.
You left me alone. I had to do
everything by myself...
You're scaring me.
I was going to protect you, Clara.
I liked you...
But now I don't care. Now... when
the others come... you can die
along with everyone else.
Status, Mister Data?
At our current speed, we will
clear the nebula in twelve
minutes, four seconds.
Continue full sensor sweeps. I
want all the information we can
gather.
Captain -- forward velocity down
point six percent.
Velocity down two point four
percent.
Mister Data?
We are moving through a dense
concentration of energy strands.
Can we go to warp?
The stress on the hull would be
too great...
Captain -- density appears to be
lower off the starboard bow.
Ensign, bring us to bearing
oh-three-oh mark five.
Aye, sir...
Forward velocity holding...
Steady as she goes...
Something wrong with the cake?
Pardon me?
When I see you with a piece of
chocolate cake... that hasn't been
touched... either the cake's no
good -- or something's bothering
you.
I'm sure the cake is fine. I've
just been thinking...
Let me guess... about a little
girl and her imaginary friend.
I'm just... wondering... if I'm
doing the right thing.
How so?
I know the best thing to do is
to gradually wean her away from
her fantasy... And today she did
meet some new friends, and had
a good time with them.
But?
But... at the same time, I can't
help wondering if I'm stealing
something from her... something
precious...
... a part of her childhood that
she'll never have again.
I don't know about that. I was
just telling Clara about my
imaginary friend.
Your imaginary friend?
Yeah -- a Tarcassian razor beast.
It protected me. I knew nothing
could ever hurt me as long as I
had that razor beast around.
Over the years, its body kind of
faded away. What was left was
more of an idea than a thing.
I don't talk to it nearly as much
as I used to.
You still talk to it?
All the time. When I get
scared... or confused... or I
need help. The way I see it, you
don't ever have to lose your
imaginary friend.
If it's something you need in your
life -- it'll be there.
It just might not be called an
imaginary friend anymore.
Ensign Sutter to Counselor Troi.
Go ahead, Ensign.
Would you come to my quarters?
I'm having a problem with Clara.
On my way.
She won't even go into her room.
She's terrified "Isabella" is
going to hurt her.
Clara... your father tells me
Isabella has been saying some very
bad things to you.
What did she say?
She said they were going to come
and kill everyone.
Who's going to come and kill
everyone?
The others... like her.
Did she say why?
I know you must be very
frightened. Sometimes what we
imagine can be just as scary as
something real.
But I promise you -- there's no
way Isabella can harm you or
anyone on this ship.
But she's not imaginary anymore.
She's real now. I can see
her...
You can see her... ?
Yes.
If I go with you and hold your
hand, will you go into your room?
I think so...
We'll make sure Isabella isn't
anywhere around. Alright?
Come on.
Do you see anybody?
Let's look under the bed...
Is she there?
Now... where else?
Is she behind here?
Maybe Isabella's gone home...
Anything there?
Maybe Isabella knows you're making
new friends now.
In fact, I'll bet she won't be
coming around as much anymore...
What about the closet?
Oh. Okay...
Anybody in here?
She was eleven, maybe twelve...
with blonde hair...
Clara...
Clara's sleeping. She's going
to be fine.
Her bioelectrical processes were
severely disrupted. It's like
the energy was pulled right out
of her body.
Captain... Clara told me her
imaginary friend was making
threats. She claimed that others
were on the way... and that they
were going to kill everyone on
the ship.
Picard to Lieutenant Worf.
Worf here.
We have established the presence
of what appears to be an alien
entity on board.
It seems the entity has manifested
itself in the form of a twelve-
year-old girl who has been seen
with Clara Sutter. She has blonde
hair... blue eyes...
... and a blue dress? Yes sir,
I have seen her.
When?
Two days ago, near engineering.
She was with Miss Sutter.
Engineering... Security Alert,
Mister Worf. Be on the lookout.
Aye, sir.
She insisted on talking to you.
It's about Isabella...
What about her, Clara?
I think her feelings were hurt.
She said she liked me... that she
liked being with me. She was my
friend. She only got mean when
I stopped paying attention to
her...
Did she say when the others were
coming?
Thanks, Sweetie. Go back to bed
now... we'll handle this.
But Daddy...
Thank you, Clara. If we need
your help again, I hope we can
count on you.
Yes, Captain.
Captain Picard -- report to the
the bridge.
On my way.
Report.
Our speed is down by twenty-two
percent.
Strand density is ten times what
it was, Captain. We can't take
many more hits...
All stop.
Sir -- something is heading
toward us, bearing one-oh-three
mark oh-two-four.
On screen.
What is it?
It appears to be an energy
vortex... of highly complex
patterns. Very possibly a life
form.
Red Alert!
It is in direct physical contact
with the shields.
Shields dropping to seventy-five
percent... seventy-two percent...
The damn thing's feeding off
our shields. Data -- remodulate
the shield frequencies!
Aye, sir.
No effect.
Shields to sixty-four percent.
We have about eight minutes before
those things drain our shields.
Any ideas?
Isabella... Isabella...
Isabella... Don't you want to talk
to me? I'm not mad at you...
We know you've been on the ship
for some time now. We know you've
been posing as Clara's friend --
and that you've been threatening
her...
We can only assume there's a
connection between you and the
life-forms attacking our ship...
You are obviously an intelligent
being. There's no reason for
you to hide...
Talk to us. Or can you only
communicate by frightening a small
child?
I'm scared, Isabella...
Who are you?
I came here to determine whether
you were a threat to us. And to
examine the purity of your energy
sources.
Energy... is that why they're
draining our shields?
Yes. The emissions from your
graviton field generators are
far richer than our normal
sources of energy.
Picard to bridge. Report.
Shields are down to three percent.
We're diverting all available
power.
Acknowledged.
If it's energy you want, we can
provide it in other ways. You
needn't destroy us.
You should be destroyed. You are
cruel, uncaring creatures.
What makes you say that?
The way you treat Clara.
In what way did we mistreat her?
You wouldn't let her do what she
wanted to... or go where she
wanted to...
You mean where you wanted her to.
Why does that make a difference?
You were taking her to places that
were inappropriate -- even
dangerous.
I wouldn't have let anything
happen to her...
We had no way of knowing that.
We had no way of knowing you were
real. All we knew was that a
little girl's imaginary friend
was scaring her... threatening
her...
That was only after you tried to
keep her from being my friend.
I'm beginning to understand.
You've seen this ship... all of
us... from a unique perspective
-- a child's point of view. It
must have seemed terribly unfair
and restrictive...
As adults, we don't always stop
to realize how everything we say
and do shapes the impressions of
young people.
But if you are to judge us as a
people by the way we treat our
children... and I cannot think
of a better criterion... you must
understand how deeply we care for
them. When our children are
young, they cannot always
understand what might be
dangerous. Our rules are a way
to keep them from harm. Either
real or imagined.
This is part of the continuity
of the Human species. You see...
when Clara grows up, she will make
rules for her children... to
protect them... just as we
protect her.
Please don't hurt us.
If you still want to be my best
friend, I'd like it very much.
Status, Number One?
We're free of the strands. We'll
have full warp capability in
twenty minutes.
Notify all sections we'll be
leaving the area in one hour.
Sir?
Mister LaForge, I want you to
drive the warp engines to full
power, and direct a flow of energy
out into the nebula.
Aye, sir...
I came to say... I'm sorry I
frightened you.
It's okay.
And I misled you. I wasn't really
your Isabella.
For a while you were.
I never had a friend before.
I'm sorry I have to go away.
Do you think you'll ever come
back?
I hope so.
So do I.
