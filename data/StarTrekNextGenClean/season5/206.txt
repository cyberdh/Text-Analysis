			Etana...
			I know you're back there...
			don't make me come after you.
			Give me that...
			You don't need this.
			Yes... I... do...
			Commander Riker to the
			Enterprise. I've got a problem
			down here on Risa!
			Give it to me.
			Go get it.
			I can't believe you did that.
			Believe it.
			What's this?
			It's a game. Everyone here's
			playing it.
			Do I keep my eyes open, or
			closed?
			Open.
			What am I seeing?
			The playing field.
			Now what?
			See the disc and the cone?
			Yeah...
			Concentrate... Make the disc go
			into the cone...
			How do I do this?
			Relax... just let go. You'll do
			it.
			Got it.
			What was that?
			Your reward. For clearing the
			first level.
			How far does this game go?
			As far as you can take it. You
			want to try for level two?
			Captain's log, stardate 45208.2.
			Commander Riker has rejoined the
			Enterprise from Risa. And we are
			on our way to an uncharted area
			called the Phoenix Cluster.
			We are all anticipating this
			historic first look at the
			region.
			Things are getting busy around
			here. Five more science teams
			just beamed in from the Zhukov.
			Quarters are filling up fast.
			And on top of everything, there's
			been a change. We now have only
			two weeks to complete the
			exploration.
			Two weeks... that's not enough
			time to explore a region that
			size. I thought we had five
			weeks.
			Starfleet has added a diplomatic
			mission to Oceanus Four.
			Will, I'm leaving it up to you to
			make sure all science departments
			have an equal chance to complete
			their research.
			It'll be quite a juggling act.
			A bit of good news, as well.
			We're to rendezvous with a
			shuttlecraft carrying Wesley
			Crusher. He's on vacation from
			the Academy.
			Wesley... good. We'll need an
			extra hand around here.
			Geordi... how are you coming with
			the survey preparations?
			I'm up to my neck in observation
			schedules right now.
			Our biggest hurdle is sensor
			availability.
			Especially since two new
			exobiologists and three stellar
			cartographers joined us from the
			Zhukov.
			Fifteen science teams, only two
			weeks, and one long-range array
			don't make a great combination.
			What about the lateral sensors?
			They're booked solid for
			planetary observation.
			And the gamma ray scanner?
			We're reprogramming it now...
			Lefler... will you join us,
			please?
			You know Robin Lefler.
			Of course.
			Her performance around here has
			been sensational. I've decided
			to make her a mission specialist.
			Congratulations.
			Thank you, sir.
			Okay, specialist -- what's our
			sensor status?
			We're increasing the available
			bandwidth... so more science
			teams can use the sensors at
			once. We figured out a way to do
			it by multiplexing the array.
			Will it be ready by the time we
			arrive?
			Yessir. You can count on it.
			Keep it up, Lefler.
			Geordi... I brought something
			back from Risa. You've got to
			try it.
			I'd love to. But I'm running a
			full sensor recalibration in ten
			minutes. Can it wait?
			Sure. I'll catch up with you
			later.
			Chocolate ice cream. Chocolate
			fudge. Chocolate chips. You're
			not depressed, are you?
			I'm fine, Commander.
			Did you want to be alone with
			that?
			No. You can join us.
			I don't like fudge.
			Really. I never met a chocolate
			I didn't like.
			Doesn't it taste good?
			Of course it does. But it's not
			just a matter of taste. It's the
			whole experience.
			First you spoon the fudge from
			around the rim... leaving only
			ice cream in the middle...
			Then gently spoon the ice cream
			around the sides, like you're
			sculpting it...
			Relish every bite. Make every
			one an event. And on the last
			bite, close your eyes...
			I never knew it was a ritual.
			Chocolate is a serious thing.
			You know... I brought something
			back from Risa. It's better than
			chocolate.
			Oh... what is it?
			Just a game.
			Chief O'Brien!
			Welcome back, Wesley.
			Congratulations on little Molly.
			Thanks. Wait till you see her --
			she's the spitting image of her
			dad.
			So... where is everyone? Is my
			mom around?
			The senior staff is holding a
			meeting. You're supposed to go
			to your mother's quarters.
			Oh. Well, do you think it'd be
			alright if I stopped by... just
			to say hi?
			I'll check.
			Chief O'Brien to bridge.
			Bridge here.
			Wesley Crusher has arrived and
			wants to know if he can stop by
			the observation lounge...
			To say "hi".
			That is acceptable.
			Thanks.
			Welcome home.
			Thanks, Mom.
			Wesley...
			Captain...
			Quomodo tua Latinitas est?
			(How's your Latin?)
			Praestat quam prius. (It's
			better than before.)
			Oppido bonum. (Very good.) Your
			Latin has improved.
			You're looking very handsome.
			You do that cadet uniform
			justice, Wesley.
			Bet you drive the girls wild.
			Tarvokian pound cake. I made it
			myself.
			Thanks, Worf.
			Wesley -- was our attempt to make
			you uncomfortable effective?
			You bet it was. For a second
			there, I thought I was on the
			wrong ship.
			And you found the deception
			pleasurable?
			Well... yeah. It's fun to be
			surprised.
			Are you here to work or play,
			Mister Crusher?
			Sir?
			I know you're on vacation.
			You'll probably want to sleep
			late, and go to the holodeck.
			But if you'd like to help out, we
			could use an extra hand in
			preparing for the Phoenix Cluster
			survey.
			That'd be great, sir.
			After you're settled, come down
			to engineering. We'll get you
			started.
			Aye sir.
			What kind of game?
			Come by my quarters, and I'll
			show it to you...
			Have you found the Academy
			challenging, Wesley?
			After the Enterprise, I thought
			it would be a breeze... but
			there's a lot more to learn
			besides starship operations.
			How was your first year?
			Although I did extremely well
			scholastically, my lack of Human
			understanding often created
			social obstacles.
			Like what?
			I particularly recall a
			phenomenon called practical
			jokes, several of which I fell
			victim to.
			Tell me about it. My first week
			there, a guy named Adam Martoni
			reprogrammed the sonic shower to
			cover me with mud. It took me a
			while, but I got him back pretty
			good...
			I also found social gatherings
			difficult. There was one event,
			an Academy tradition, something
			called the Sadie Hawkins Dance.
			Yeah... they still hold it every
			year.
			It was a notably awkward
			experience.
			Don't worry, Data... I can't
			dance either.
			Really? Your mother is quite an
			expert. She recently taught me.
			Yeah, I know. "The Dancing
			Doctor." She tried to teach me.
			I just don't seem to have the
			knack.
			I would be happy to give you
			lessons while you are here on
			vacation. I have created a
			comprehensive seventeen part
			course with some interesting
			holographic dancing partners.
			Several members of the crew have
			become quite proficient...
			I'll let you know, Data.
			I'll try modifying the planetary
			scanners.
			Just make sure we keep enough
			data lines open for stellar
			physics.
			No problem. I'll compress the
			signal flow...
			Now why won't these register... ?
			You might try calibrating them
			manually.
			Excuse me?
			The detectors. They tend to get
			temperamental. Try calibrating
			them by hand.
			Are you kidding? It's gotta be
			done by the computer.
			No, it doesn't. Here...
			This subroutine will let you do
			it from the panel...
			Law Seventeen -- When all else
			fails, do it yourself.
			It's working...
			Thanks.
			Sure.
			I'm Wesley, by the way... Wesley
			Crusher.
			I know. Just came back from the
			Academy.
			That's right.
			Robin Lefler.
			Hi.
			Hi.
			Your neutrinos are drifting.
			What? Oh!
			A conflict has started between
			the planetary evolution team and
			the stellar physicists. Both
			wish to use the thermal imaging
			array first.
			Well... tell them to flip a coin.
			They've got to cooperate on this
			mission, or we'll never get it
			done.
			A coin. Very good. I will
			replicate one immediately.
			Crusher to Data.
			Go ahead, Doctor.
			Do you have a minute to join me
			in sickbay?
			Yes, Doctor. I am on my way.
			You wanted to see me, Doctor?
			Yes, Data. I need your help with
			something.
			I'm running a new experiment on
			bioactive silicon. Would you
			reprogram the tricorder to these
			specifications?
			Certainly.
			Sorry to bother you with this,
			but I need it done quickly.
			It does not bother me. In fact,
			I am happy to --
			Computer -- secure sickbay.
			All entries to sickbay are
			secured.
			Let's see... I had Novakovich for
			anthropology... and Horne for
			creative writing...
			Walter Horne... is he still
			teaching?
			And you'll be happy to know, I
			took your advice. The first week
			I was there, I went to meet
			Boothby.
			Is he still tending the
			grounds... or has age finally
			caught up with him?
			Not that I can tell. He took me
			on a grand tour... showed me
			every single blade of grass,
			practically.
			I got the very same tour...
			Sir... what do the initials S-P
			stand for?
			S-P...
			Boothby said he once found you
			carving those initials into his
			prized elm tree.
			Oh... just an old acquaintance.
			Wesley. If you meet someone
			whose initials you might want to
			carve into the elm tree, try not
			to let it interfere with your
			studies.
			I failed organic chemistry
			because of S-P.
			Crusher to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead, Doctor.
			I need you in sickbay
			immediately.
			On my way.
			He came in to complain about a
			servo malfunction. My scans were
			coming out negative. And then he
			just... collapsed.
			What have you found?
			His biosystems and positronic
			functions seem to check out. And
			his power cells are active...
			From what I can tell, his higher
			functions are intact. But the
			signals aren't getting from his
			brain to the rest of his body.
			It's like he's in a coma.
			Data performs self-diagnostic
			routines on a regular basis. We
			should take a look at his logs --
			they might tell us something.
			I recommend searching his
			quarters, as well. You never
			know what might turn up.
			Agreed. Continue your analysis.
			Keep me informed.
			Standard security sweep shows
			nothing out of the ordinary.
			Personal logs, diagnostics, duty
			logs... they all look normal. No
			evidence of anything leading to
			Data's shutdown.
			Maybe we should ask his cat.
			I'd better get back to sickbay.
			See if there's any change in his
			condition...
			Doctor Crusher's got a handle on
			it, Geordi. You'd be the first
			person she'd call...
			I guess so...
			Looks to me like you need a
			break... unwind a little.
			Maybe you're right.
			I know just the thing.
			Why don't you meet me in Ten
			Forward? I've got something I
			want you to try.
			Conduits twelve and twenty-two
			are still down for testing.
			We can re-route through junction
			fourteen B...
			You have a funny way of looking
			at conduit configuration. But it
			works.
			Law Thirty-Six -- You gotta go
			with what works.
			What are these laws you keep
			talking about?
			My own personal laws. When I
			learn something essential, I make
			up a law about it. That way, I
			never forget.
			How many laws do you have?
			One hundred and two... so far.
			Looks like the starboard array
			needs another subprocessor.
			Don't worry, it'll be on-line in
			a few minutes. I'm way ahead of
			you.
			They said you were good.
			Why do I get the feeling you
			already know me?
			I have a couple of friends at the
			Academy. Your name's come up a
			few times.
			That was some prank you pulled on
			Adam Martoni in the physics lab.
			I just want to know how you got
			the antimatter regulator to spray
			chili sauce.
			Uh... there's another side to
			that story...
			And is it true about your
			birthmark?
			This isn't fair. I know nothing
			about you.
			Law Forty-six -- Life isn't
			always...
			... isn't always fair. I know
			that law.
			I've gotta go work on the sensor
			relays. But later, I want a
			chance to even the score.
			Ten Forward, nineteen hundred
			hours. Will you join me for
			coffee?
			No.
			But I'll join you for dinner.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			have arrived at the Phoenix
			Cluster, but it will take us
			several hours to determine the
			best possible location from which
			to conduct our survey. In the
			meantime, Commander Data's
			condition remains unchanged, with
			no further indication as to the
			cause of his breakdown.
			Mom?
			Wesley...
			What are you doing?
			I'm embarrassed to say this was
			meant for you. But it's so much
			fun, I couldn't resist.
			What is it?
			A game. Will Riker brought it
			back from Risa.
			Everybody's playing it. Would
			you like to try?
			Maybe later.
			Any word on Data?
			Geordi's still working on him.
			He's going to be fine.
			Maybe I should give Geordi a
			hand...
			No, Wes. This is your vacation.
			You're doing more than enough
			already.
			I guess you're right.
			Are you in a hurry?
			Well, actually... I'm running
			behind schedule for a dinner
			date.
			Really. With who?
			Robin Lefler -- from engineering.
			Why don't you invite her over?
			We can all play the game
			together. I'll replicate a
			couple more.
			Mom...
			Sorry. I just want to spend some
			time together while you're here.
			We'll spend lots of time
			together. I promise.
			Okay.
			Come on, just one game. Try it
			on for size...
			I need to change now.
			Have a good time.
			Thanks.
			When your parents are the only
			exobiologists in the sector, you
			do a lot of travelling around.
			Base to base to base...
			After a while, I felt like a
			piece of luggage.
			I spent most of my time around
			technical gear. My very first
			friend was a tricorder.
			Really? Mine was a warp coil.
			My parents weren't around much.
			Even when I needed them... their
			work always came first. That's
			how I learned my first law. Law
			One -- The only person you can
			rely on is yourself.
			Sounds lonely.
			And now you're here.
			Now I'm here.
			I'm glad.
			You wouldn't believe what's
			happening in engineering.
			Commander LaForge and the
			others... they're crazy about
			this new game.
			Game?
			Some Risian gadget. A little
			thing that fits over your ear.
			Have you played it?
			Not yet.
			My mom has one. She was trying
			to get me to play it.
			It's everywhere.
			See what I mean?
			It's strange, don't you think?
			Everybody playing it all the
			time...
			It's a fad. This week it's
			popular, next week we won't even
			know it existed.
			I wonder how it works?
			Why don't you try it and find
			out?
			I'd want to know more about it
			first.
			We could hook it up to a
			computer. The medical programs
			can simulate human brain
			responses...
			The game uses a visual
			interface... we could connect it
			through an optical sensor...
			Okay... I've loaded the
			neurological behavior program.
			This sensor pad should allow the
			computer to process whatever
			information the game throws at
			it.
			Let's see what happens...
			It's activating the reticular
			formation...
			Heavy synaptic activity... all
			over the place...
			I wonder what happens after
			prolonged exposure...
			Speed up the processor and we'll
			find out.
			The effects are centered in the
			frontal lobe.
			Computer, enhance frontal lobe --
			full spectrum.
			It's stimulating the septal
			area...
			... The pleasure center of the
			brain. Whatever this game does,
			it must feel pretty good.
			No wonder it's popular.
			Wait a second... look at this.
			Serotonin levels are way off.
			Let's do a neurochemical
			analysis...
			I'm seeing widespread bonding to
			neuroreceptors...
			Correct me if I'm wrong, but this
			looks like a psychotropic
			reaction.
			Are you saying you think the
			game's addictive?
			What's going on in the prefrontal
			cortex?
			Doesn't that area control higher
			reasoning?
			Yeah... it sure does.
			I'd better talk to the captain.
			Come.
			Sorry to bother you, Captain.
			No bother at all, Wesley,
			please...
			How are the survey preparations
			coming along?
			Fine, sir... but that's not why
			I'm here.
			Oh... why then?
			There's a game going around...
			something Commander Riker brought
			back from Risa. A little device
			that hooks around the ear...
			Yes, I've seen it.
			I did some preliminary tests on
			the game. What I found leads me
			to believe it may have harmful
			side effects. Specifically sir --
			I think it's psychotropically
			addictive.
			Addictive... What have you
			discovered?
			The game initiates a serotonin
			cascade in the frontal lobe of
			the brain. Now I know that's
			nothing conclusive... but it
			could be the reason people are so
			attracted to it.
			And at the same time, it seems to
			be stimulating the brain's
			reasoning center... I don't know
			what that's all about...
			We'll start an investigation
			immediately. Thank you, Mister
			Crusher.
			And Wesley...
			Good to have you back.
			Thank you, sir.
			Have you tried this?
			I've tried it, thanks. It's
			great.
			Robin...
			Sorry.
			Where have you been? Everyone's
			been after me to play.
			Me too. I was stopped twice in
			the corridor.
			I spoke with Captain Picard.
			He's going to look into it.
			I hope he makes a shipwide
			announcement or something...
			This is starting to give me the
			creeps.
			Did you forget your games?
			We left them in our quarters.
			Well then... you can use mine.
			No thanks...
			She said no thanks.
			There's something else bothering
			me about all this -- if the game
			is addictive... there's only one
			person on the ship we can be sure
			wouldn't be affected by it...
			Data.
			Right. And he just happened to
			get injured at the same time this
			game was brought on board.
			I think we should take a look at
			him.
			The nurse is still playing the
			game.
			I don't know what to make of
			this. There's brain activity...
			all his systems seem to be
			working.
			How can that be? He's
			unconscious.
			There might be a signal breach
			somewhere... between his brain
			and his body. Let's map his
			nervous system... see if we can
			isolate a weak link...
			Still nothing...
			Here.
			The signal stops here. Below his
			cognitive processor.
			There's some kind of damage...
			almost undetectable...
			Turn on the viewer.
			Wesley, look.
			It looks like some of his
			positronic links have been
			severed.
			The cuts are very precise... see
			how clean the edges are?
			Computer, increase magnification,
			factor four.
			Only two people on board know
			enough about Data to have done
			something like this. Commander
			LaForge... and my mother.
			Why would one of them do this to
			him?
			Maybe there's more going on here
			than we thought. Someone could
			be trying to use the game -- for
			some purpose other than
			pleasure...
			If that's the case... Data would
			have been a threat to that
			plan... but with him out of the
			way, everybody else could become
			addicted.
			And everybody has. Except us.
			We've reached the designated
			coordinates, Captain. There is
			a ship bearing three-two-seven
			mark one-five-two on an intercept
			course.
			Advise them of our status, Mister
			Worf.
			Go replicate what you need. See
			that the devices are properly
			distributed.
			And don't forget Mister Crusher.
			Wesley?
			Wesley?
			In here, Mom.
			It worked.
			Better keep the mock-ups with us.
			We can't trust anyone now. Not
			even the captain.
			I'm supposed to be on duty in
			engineering. I've gotta get back
			before Commander LaForge
			suspects something.
			When you get there, start
			accessing the codes for the
			security tracking system.
			There's something I want to
			try...
			Wesley. Don't forget Law Ninety-One...
			Always watch your back.
			You too.
			The vessel is approaching,
			Captain.
			All senior officers report to the
			bridge.
			On screen.
			Report.
			The Enterprise has been secured.
			We await your further
			instructions.
			The expansion will proceed as
			follows...
			Commander Riker.
			Pilot a shuttlecraft to these
			coordinates...
			You will rendezvous with the
			Starship Endeavor. Resume
			distribution of the device aboard
			that vessel.
			Commander LaForge and Counselor
			Troi... take a shuttle to
			Starbase Sixty-seven. Distribute
			the device to all starships
			currently docked there.
			We also have an opportunity to
			introduce the game to Starfleet
			Academy.
			Excellent. See to it.
			The Ktarians commend your
			efforts, Picard. When the
			expansion is complete... you and
			your crew will be rewarded.
			Deck thirty-six.
			I think we're gonna be okay.
			I've just got one more thing to
			do...
			Help me compile the forcefield
			overrides...
			What are you doing?
			I created a site to site
			transporter program. If things
			get difficult, this'll keep us
			one step ahead...
			Did you get a chance to access
			the security tracking codes?
			Robin... ?
			It's your turn, Wesley. Play the
			game.
			Computer -- activate security
			containment field on deck thirty-six,
			section fifty-two!
			Computer -- transport program
			Crusher One!
			Riker to bridge. We've lost
			Crusher. It looks like he rigged
			a site to site transport.
			Security alert, condition three.
			Computer, shut down all
			transporter systems and shuttle
			bays.
			Mister LaForge?
			I can't track him, sir. He's
			done something to the internal
			security sensors. I'll try
			bypassing his subcommands. Hold
			on...
			I'm picking up a piece of his
			trail, sir -- sensors show power
			activation in transporter room
			three. That would put him
			somewhere on deck six.
			Seal off deck six. Activate
			security fields on section twenty-
			three through twenty-nine.
			Aye sir.
			We've got him, Captain -- section
			twenty-five. It looks like he's
			trying to break through the
			forcefield with a phaser.
			Security to deck six, section
			twenty-five.
			Where the hell is he?
			I am attempting to isolate him
			with thermal sensors...
			Narrow the scan field. Go deck
			by deck if you have to...
			Unfortunately, he knows our
			procedures... he will avoid
			corridors and public areas...
			I am reading an unidentified heat
			source on deck seven, section
			twenty-three...
			There...
			You gave us quite a chase, Mister
			Crusher.
			Doctor Crusher...
			Hold him steady.
			It's okay, Wesley. It doesn't
			hurt. You'll like it. I promise
			you...
			No...
			His eyes.
			No...
			That's it, Wesley... just let
			yourself go...
			Computer, resume normal
			illumination.
			Mister Worf, you will find a
			small alien ship off the
			starboard bow. Secure it with a
			tractor beam and raise our
			shields.
			Engaging tractor beam.
			Are you all right, Captain?
			I think so...
			Captain, we are being hailed by
			the alien vessel.
			On screen.
			Picard, explain yourself.
			The explanation is simple -- your
			attempt to capture this ship has
			failed.
			Release us immediately. Or we
			will open fire.
			Tactical analysis, Mister Worf?
			Their weapons capability is
			substantially inferior to ours.
			They are not a threat.
			Get her off the screen.
			I can't believe what we were
			about to do...
			Data... we deactivated you...
			I managed to reconnect his
			positronic matrix.
			Wesley's subsequent diversions
			gave me adequate time to modify
			the palm beacon...
			The optical burst patterns we
			programmed were successful in
			counteracting the addictive
			effects of the game.
			And the rest of the crew?
			We have programmed the main
			computer to transmit the same
			optical pulse to all display
			screens, work stations and
			terminals throughout the ship.
			That'll reach almost everyone.
			Send out medical teams to treat
			the rest.
			Aye sir.
			We'll take the alien vessel to
			the nearest Federation starbase.
			Ensign, lay in a course.
			Captain's log, stardate 45212.1.
			We have delivered the Ktarian
			vessel to Starbase Eighty-two.
			We are now on a course to
			rendezvous with the Starship
			Merrimack, which will take Wesley
			Crusher back to the Academy now
			that his vacation is over...
			I never saw you wear these.
			Afraid someone might see your
			birthmark?
			Who started that birthmark rumor,
			anyway?
			Wish you didn't have to go.
			Me too.
			You'll write, won't you?
			Somebody's got to kill those
			rumors you keep hearing about me.
			Mister Crusher, we've
			rendezvoused with the Merrimack.
			Please report to transporter room
			two.
			On my way, sir.
			I'd better go.
			Here...
			A gift. So you'll remember.
			Robin's Laws. All one hundred
			and two of them.
			Law number one hundred and
			three...
			Yes?
			A couple of light years can't
			keep good friends apart.
