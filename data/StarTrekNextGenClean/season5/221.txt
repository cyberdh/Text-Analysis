			Captain's log, stardate 45761.3.
			In an effort to bring an end to
			their centuries-long war, Krios
			and Valt Minor have agreed to
			a Ceremony of Reconciliation, to
			be held aboard the Enterprise at
			a point mid-way between their
			two systems.
			I apologize for the delay in our
			arrival; we had to stop at Harod
			Four and pick up a group of
			stranded miners.
			Please, Captain. We are grateful
			that the Federation has taken as
			much interest as it has in this
			matter.
			Was Mister LaForge able to
			provide the special cargo handling
			provisions you requested?
			Indeed he was. However... until
			we reach our rendezvous with the
			Valtese, may I ask that the cargo
			bay be declared off-limits to all
			but the most essential personnel?
			I trust, Ambassador, that this
			cargo is not in any way dangerous?
			Nothing of the sort. It is a
			gift... for Alrik, the Valtese
			leader. I am cautious only
			because it is quite fragile...
			and quite irreplaceable.
			Bridge to Captain Picard...
			Go ahead.
			We've picked up a distress call
			from a Ferengi shuttle...
			Set a course to intercept...
			Aye, sir...
			Captain, the timing of our
			ceremony with Alrik is critical.
			It cannot be delayed...
			We'll be at the rendezvous on
			schedule, don't worry.
			The Ferengi report their
			containment field is collapsing...
			We are within visual range.
			On screen.
			Their reactor core is unstable,
			Captain...
			How many on board?
			Two, sir.
			Bridge to transporter room three.
			Boost your output and lock on
			to the two Ferengi on board the
			shuttle. We may have to attempt
			a long-range transport.
			Standing by.
			Energize!
			Got them, sir.
			Mister Worf, escort our Ferengi
			guests to quarters...
			... not too close to mine.
			Understood.
			Unless you can arrange for your
			own transport, you will have to
			remain on the Enterprise until
			we have completed our mission...
			That will not be a problem.
			We are in no hurry.
			We look forward to enjoying the
			comforts of your fine ship.
			Quite acceptable. Not what we're
			used to, you understand... but
			it will do.
			Perhaps your captain would care
			to invite us to join him for
			dinner this evening...
			The captain dines alone.
			A pity.
			That was too easy!
			We've been working from your
			drawings, Ambassador... I hope
			we're in the ballpark...
			Ball - park... ?
			An old Human expression... Mister
			LaForge hopes we've come close
			to achieving what you wanted...
			Computer, run holodeck program
			Krios One.
			Enter when ready.
			Astonishing. It is the ancient
			Temple of Akadar.
			It is this temple that bonds Krios
			and Valt, gentlemen... two
			brothers once ruled a vast empire
			from this site... until they were
			torn apart by their love for an
			extraordinary woman. This is
			where the wars began. And this
			is where they shall end.
			There are details of course to
			be added...
			Mister LaForge is entirely at
			your disposal, Ambassador...
			Just let me know what you need...
			Yes, of course... I must consult
			several of the historical volumes
			that I brought with me...
			perhaps we can reconvene later
			this...
			Excuse me... excuse me... is it
			true? Is a Kriosian ambassador
			aboard this vessel?
			Yes. Can I help you?
			The ambassador is very busy...
			Ah, do you schedule his
			appointments?
			I am the captain of this ship.
			What is it you want?
			Allow me to present myself. Par
			Lenor of the Ferengi Trade
			Mission. We are pleased to hear
			that you have at last negotiated
			peace with the Valtese,
			Ambassador. Peace is good for
			trade... unless you happen to be
			an arms merchant!
			... in return for the exclusive
			rights to transport all Kriosian
			products to the Valt system...
			May I suggest that you arrange
			to meet at another time, after
			the ceremony?
			Perhaps that would be best.
			But...
			Listen... have you been down to
			see the dolphins yet? You really
			shouldn't miss them...
			Deck seven.
			Picard to Worf.
			Worf, here.
			One of the Ferengi just waylaid
			Ambassador Briam. Keep a short
			leash on them, Lieutenant.
			I don't want them disrupting this
			conference.
			Aye, sir.
			Security to cargo bay one.
			Lieutenant?
			One of the Ferengi.
			You! What are you doing?
			This is a misunderstanding... I
			was looking for the barbershop...
			Apparently I made an incorrect
			turn -- and...
			No...
			Get him out of here. Confine both
			of them to their quarters and put
			a guard on the door.
			What is happening?
			Emergence...
			I am for you, Alrik of Valt.
			No, Kamala... this is not Alrik.
			This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
			of the Federation Starship
			Enterprise.
			That explains why you don't look
			at all like your holographs. I
			apologize, Captain. As an empath,
			I could sense your authority.
			I assumed that you were
			Chancellor Alrik...
			I'm afraid I require an
			explanation...
			As do I, Ambassador. Why have
			I been brought out of stasis
			prematurely?
			There was an accident...
			Captain, this is quite
			complicated, perhaps we should...
			It is not complicated at all,
			Briam. And the Captain has no
			tolerance for prevarication.
			I am a gift to Alrik of Valt.
			You've been using this ship to
			transport a sentient being as
			property?
			Not as property... as a gift...
			I was concerned that you would
			not entirely understand...
			Your concern was justified,
			Ambassador...
			You're angry. Why?
			There is a provision within the
			Federation Constitution that
			protects an individual's
			fundamental rights... once you
			were brought aboard this
			starship...
			You are coming to my rescue! What
			a kind and generous purpose. But
			Captain, I do not need to be
			rescued...
			Kamala is the key to peace between
			our two worlds...
			Why?
			In our history there was a woman
			known as Garuth who was loved by
			the brothers Krios and Valt with
			such passion that an empire
			fell...
			The wars began when Krios
			kidnapped Garuth and took her to
			our planet...
			Like her, I am an empathic
			metamorph. The first female
			metamorph born on my world for
			over a hundred years.
			A "metamorph"?
			A mutant. A biological curiosity,
			if you will. With the ability
			to sense what a potential mate
			wants... what he needs... what
			gives him the greatest pleasure...
			and then to become that for him.
			You mean... you change according
			to whatever man you're with...
			Until I reach the stage of
			bonding... When I must imprint
			upon myself the requirements of
			one man... to serve as his perfect
			partner in life.
			Male metamorphs are somewhat
			common but a female appears only
			once in seven generations...
			obviously, they are highly sought
			after as mates...
			Which explains our Ferengi's
			interest...
			This mating to Alrik was arranged
			at her birth... by leaders of
			both worlds; in the hopes of
			restoring peace...
			You do this of your own accord?
			It is my sole purpose in life.
			Commander Riker will show you to
			quarters. You need not travel
			in a cargo bay.
			Kamala, remain in your room. I
			will speak to you shortly.
			Why were you in stasis?
			Metamorphs have a long and complex
			sexual maturing process. I am
			in the Finiis'ral, the third and
			final stage. It can be an
			uncomfortable transition... Not
			only for me, but for the men
			around me...
			In what way?
			My body is producing an unusually
			elevated level of what you would
			call pheromones. The effect can
			be quite... provocative. Perhaps
			you sense it...
			Ah, unfortunately, I'm not an
			empath...
			Oh, I think you are more empathic
			than you admit... at least when
			it comes to women...
			I think you have me at a
			disadvantage...
			The replicator is here...
			companel here... the sonic shower
			is through there... you can adjust
			the lights by verbal commands...
			and if you have any questions,
			just ask the...
			...the... computer...
			I'm beginning to sense those
			elevated pheromones you were
			talking about...
			You were curious, weren't you?
			Curious isn't exactly the way I'd
			describe it.
			Do you know what is remarkable
			about empathic metamorphs?
			You mean, there's something even
			more remarkable about you?
			We learn so quickly what
			stimulates a man... that the
			second time is even better than
			the first...
			Listen... this has been...
			educational... but I've made it
			a policy never to open another
			man's gift...
			I know my role in history,
			Commander... but it's going to
			be a long voyage...
			It certainly is.
			We'll try to make you as
			comfortable as possible.
			Riker to bridge. If you need me,
			I'll be in holodeck four.
			How can you simply deliver her
			like a courier into a life of
			virtual prostitution...
			Beverly, arranged marriages have
			been the basis of political
			alliances in many cultures,
			including our own...
			I'm surprised at you.
			She knows exactly what she's
			doing.
			She has been conditioned since
			the day she was born to believe
			that it is perfectly acceptable
			to exist only to please men...
			Beverly, she was born this way...
			... and bred by those people to
			seal a treaty with a seductive
			coup de grace...
			By all means, we should throw the
			Prime Directive to the wind...
			detain her against her will...
			destroy any chance these worlds
			have for peace... interefere with
			their society, with their
			customs...
			That slave trader who calls
			himself an ambassador has confined
			her to her quarters... she's a
			virtual prisoner in there...
			I didn't know that...
			It's your ship. Maybe there are
			a few things you should find out
			about.
			I'll speak with her.
			Good. ... Lovely breakfast.
			Indeed.
			Captain Picard, what a delightful
			surprise. Come in.
			Are you comfortable?
			Reasonably. Under the
			circumstances.
			It has come to my attention that
			you have been told to remain
			here...
			That's true, I'm afraid.
			Against your wishes.
			At the request of the ambassador
			who believes I might be...
			disruptive to your crew.
			My crew's performance is not the
			business of the ambassador.
			You care about my well-being.
			Thank you, Captain.
			I care about what happens on board
			my ship.
			Yes, I know. This ship is very
			important to you, isn't it... ?
			Yes...
			Are all captains' lives so...
			solitary? Or just yours?
			Don't.
			What?
			Do this.
			What you do... with men.
			I'm afraid my premature emergence
			from stasis has left me a
			little... vulnerable to the
			desires I sense from men.
			Nevertheless, this is who I am,
			Captain. You might as well ask
			a Vulcan to forgo logic... or a
			Klingon to be nonviolent. I
			cannot change, and I don't want
			to until it's time for me to
			bond with my permanent mate.
			Why does it bother you?
			Frankly, it is difficult for me...
			for many of us... to easily accept
			that a sentient being could live
			only to be what someone else wants
			them to be...
			But that's what gives a metamorph
			pleasure...
			What about your wishes? Your
			needs?
			They are fulfilled by what I give
			to others.
			And what about when there are
			no others, when you are
			alone... ?
			I am incomplete.
			What curious questions, Captain...
			I'm sorry. Under the
			circumstances, I felt it would
			help to learn more about you.
			But you know me better than you
			realize...
			I am independent, forceful,
			brilliant, and adventurous.
			Exactly as you would have me be.
			I will speak with the ambassador
			about easing your restrictions.
			Thank you, Captain.
			Captain's log, stardate 45780.3.
			We have reached the designated
			coordinates for the conference
			and await the arrival of
			Chancellor Alrik.
			No, I forbid it.
			"Forbid" it... ?
			It is too dangerous. She must
			remain in her quarters.
			You cannot confine her against
			her will, Ambassador... not on
			board this ship...
			She is requesting some freedom
			of movement... and I intend to
			give it to her...
			She is still in the Finiis'ral...
			the height of her sexual allure,
			Captain... every man on the ship
			will be fighting over her...
			Not every man...
			A chaperone... ?
			I would be pleased to escort you
			around the ship.
			What sort of man is this?
			I am an artificial lifeform.
			A blank page.
			Your empathic powers do not
			perceive anything because I have
			no emotions.
			But I was hoping we might spend
			more time together, Captain.
			Unfortunately, I'm quite busy with
			the arrangements for the
			conference.
			I am very knowledgeable about
			Valt. I could be helpful.
			I think you should enjoy the
			hospitality of our ship. Mister
			Data will see to your every
			comfort... if you will excuse
			me...
			Your empathic powers do not
			perceive anything because as an
			android, I have no emotions...
			I can understand why Captain
			Picard chose you to be my
			chaperone...
			I'll... check in with you later.
			Excuse me, but I'm absolutely
			certain that we met once at
			Paloris Colony...
			I've never been to Paloris Colony.
			Neither have I. Why don't we find
			out what else we have in common.
			Extremely rude behavior.
			He's just being playful.
			May I order you a drink?
			What are all of you having?
			Aldorian Ale's our drink...
			Then, it's mine too.
			There do not seem to be enough
			waiters on duty.
			They're having a minor problem
			with the replicator...
			They could use a hand,
			Commander...
			Certainly...
			No, I think I shall remain here...
			Mister Data's protecting me
			tonight...
			Protecting you from what?
			From you, I guess.
			I told the captain not to worry...
			I just want to have a good time
			like anybody else...
			Is there a problem here?
			Be quiet!
			Thank you, Lieutenant Worf, I
			believe the crowd has become a
			little too ebullient for
			comfort...
			... perhaps you'd enjoy a quiet
			visit to the arboretum...
			Stay here.
			Thank you again, Lieutenant.
			Ma'am.
			Perhaps the ambassador is right.
			Perhaps I should remain in my
			quarters.
			I am confident of my crew's
			self-control. But there are
			civilians and guests on board...
			I understand. I will volunteer
			to stay in my quarters under one
			condition.
			That you will visit me.
			There it is, again.
			What?
			The wall you put between us.
			You are a day away from an
			arranged mating. Why would you
			want me to visit you in your
			quarters?
			I said a visit. I didn't ask you
			to make love to me.
			A Ventanan thimble... early
			Lapeongical period, isn't it?
			Yes...
			Have you seen the Ventanan woven
			art recovered from the fourth
			colony dig... ?
			Woven art? Recovered intact?
			They say the colors are remarkably
			vibrant for their age...
			I've read about them for years...
			They were so delicate, no one
			expected to find any preserved...
			How did you hear about them?
			I stay informed on a wide variety
			of subjects... after all, one
			never knows when the conversation
			might turn to Ventanan
			archeology... or to the "dark woman
			of raven brows and mournful eyes"
			in Shakespeare's sonnets... or
			to the gardens of Les Eyries near
			the village where you grew up...
			Your empathic powers can tell that
			much about me?
			Not quite that much. Mister Data
			helped a little.
			My empathic powers can only sense
			a man of deep passion, and
			conviction... so disciplined, so
			controlled... I am simply curious
			to know what lies beneath...
			Nothing. Nothing lies beneath.
			I'm really quite dull. I fall
			asleep each night with an old book
			in my hands...
			When a metamorph finds you
			interesting... do not take
			it lightly.
			I don't take it lightly... I'm
			only...
			... trying to be as dull as
			possible.
			Will you visit me?
			It would be inappropriate.
			Is that a yes or a no?
			I'm sorry.
			Even the walls of Jericho fell,
			Captain.
			Why are you doing this?
			There can be only one reason.
			Because some part of you wants
			me to.
			What is the meaning of this?
			Ah, I see you got our message...
			If this is some sort of bribe,
			I am not amused...
			Oh no, Ambassador... your attitude
			is quite understandable...
			This is just a sample...
			The bribe is ten thousand more...
			Ludugial gold, the purest in the
			galaxy...
			We know the lifestyle of a
			Kriosian Ambassador is barely
			comfortable...
			You deserve to live a life of
			luxury...
			I am insulted. How dare you
			suggest...
			You drive a hard bargain.
			Twenty thousand, but not an ingot
			more.
			We must have the metamorph.
			She is the answer to a Ferengi
			prayer.
			A ship is waiting to rendezvous
			with us in three hours... we can
			all transport off together...
			Thank you for that information.
			I will pass it along to Captain
			Picard.
			You can't do that...
			Let go of me...
			No, wait... let us discuss...
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			The Ferengi have been dispatched
			via shuttle to Starbase
			One-one-seven; what charges will
			be brought against them depends
			on whether or not Ambassador
			Briam recovers.
			We've been able to stabilize his
			condition... If we're lucky he'll
			regain consciousness in a few
			days.
			I want a level one craniosacral
			display set up...
			I'll advise the Valtese delegation
			that the conference must be
			postponed...
			That won't be possible.
			My ability to imprint on a mate
			will only last a matter of hours
			after the completion of the
			Finiis'ral.
			If I had not been removed from
			stasis prematurely, a delay might
			have been possible. But now, I
			will have to bond with Alrik
			within two days.
			But there are several points in
			the negotiations that Briam has
			to address...
			You are familiar with the
			issues...
			Familiar, yes, but I cannot
			represent your peoples'
			interests...
			You can represent the interests
			of peace. My people will agree.
			I'm certain of it.
			There are customs and rituals with
			which I have no experience at
			all...
			I told you that I am extremely
			knowledgeable about Valt. I will
			help you prepare.
			This is impossible.
			Torze-qua...
			That's right...
			I am reminded of my piano lessons
			as a child... preparing for some
			dreaded recital...
			Do you still play?
			No. I regret that I gave it up.
			It used to please my mother...
			I did not like to perform in front
			of an audience.
			Shy...
			No. Just not very good.
			And shy.
			Dammit.
			Can we come back to this later?
			Of course.
			Thank you.
			For letting down your guard.
			If only for a moment.
			You are going to have to help me
			with the pronuniciations in this
			scroll...
			What is it about me you fear?
			Kamala...
			Do you find me unattractive?
			I find you unavailable.
			I am being terribly selfish.
			I apologize.
			We have something in common,
			Captain. When I was a child, I
			took music lessons, too.
			Really, what instrument?
			All of them.
			The entire orchestra?
			Plus a few Valtese Horns that
			sound like braying Targhee
			Moonbeasts. They are said to
			soothe the nerves of Valtese men.
			My mother never even heard me
			play. I was taken from her when
			I was four... and sequestered
			in a royal village... where I
			was prepared to fulfill my
			destiny.
			It sounds like it was a very
			lonely time for you...
			On the contrary, I had servants
			and tutors at my side
			constantly... you once wanted
			to know what I am like when I
			am alone... I have never been.
			There was always someone there...
			to educate me in literature,
			history, art, sex...
			But I have been alone on this
			journey and I've found myself
			thinking about all the curious
			questions you asked... you
			wanted to know who I am. The
			only answer that comes to me is,
			"I am for you, Alrik of Valt".
			Because that is the truth.
			In a day, I will bond with a man
			I've never met... and I will turn
			myself into what he wants me to
			be... for the rest of my life.
			I also once asked you if you were
			doing this of your own accord...
			I am honored to be chosen to serve
			my people as an emissary of
			peace...
			But I find it ironic on the eve
			of this ceremony... which I have
			spent my entire life preparing
			for... that I should meet a man
			like you...
			Riker to Picard.
			Go ahead.
			The Valtese ship has arrived.
			Chancellor Alrik is ready to beam
			aboard...
			Captain Picard...
			Chancellor Alrik, welcome aboard
			the Enterprise...
			Your first officer has described
			the details of the incident with
			the Ferengi... how is the
			Ambassador... ?
			He hasn't regained consciousness
			yet.
			A tragedy. Your willingness to
			assist is appreciated by both
			our peoples.
			I will do my best... although I
			have found some of the rituals
			quite demanding...
			Rituals. I am more concerned
			about the remaining provisions
			in the treaty... the proposed
			trade agreements are not
			acceptable... We still must review
			the uncommitted territories...
			as well as discuss the schedule
			for exchange of technology...
			The Kriosians have authorized me
			to make several compromises which
			are favorable to your position...
			Good.
			Tomorrow, then.
			Briam has supervised a
			reproduction of the ancient Temple
			of Akadar on our holodeck...
			Such a sentimental people, these
			Kriosians... it is hard to believe
			we have a common ancestry...
			I suppose they've sent the
			metamorph.
			Kamala? Yes. She is looking
			forward to meeting you.
			I'm sure she'll be satisfactory.
			Between you and me, Captain, I'm
			far more interested in the trade
			agreements.
			So, tell me quickly... what is
			he like?
			First impressions? A thoughtful
			man... informed...
			Did he ask about me?
			Yes.
			What did you tell him?
			That you were looking forward to
			meeting him.
			When am I to be presented?
			It will be the first order of
			business. Tomorrow. At ten.
			Would you like some tea?
			I should prepare for the ceremony.
			Let me help you with
			pronuniciations.
			I think I can muddle my way
			through...
			Please. Don't leave.
			Talk to me. I love the sound of
			your voice. I'll turn out the
			lights and just listen.
			I don't want to be alone.
			The lights stay on.
			Earl Grey Tea. Hot.
			Did you learn that from Mister
			Data as well?
			I shall have to have a talk with
			him.
			Now that I know you're listening
			to my voice... I can't seem to
			think of a word to say...
			A starship captain must encounter
			all sorts of lifeforms... am I
			one of the most unique you've ever
			met? Please say yes.
			Yes.
			What a nice thing to say.
			Kamala, have I not done everything
			possible to discourage this?
			Maybe that's the perfect way to
			attract a metamorph.
			I don't wish to use you as other
			men have.
			But you are not other men. You
			could never use me. That is the
			very reason why I am with you
			tonight.
			I really ought to go. You do have
			an early appointment in the
			morning.
			Light years away.
			Quiet this morning.
			Sorry.
			Penny?
			What?
			For your thoughts. Penny for your
			thoughts.
			You have one?
			The replicator ought to have one
			on file.
			Do you mind if I take off the
			uniform for a moment?
			Captain... !
			I just need to talk to a friend.
			Of course.
			Besides... it's all your fault.
			Mine?
			You insisted I look into her
			situation...
			The metamorph?
			The metamorph. Kamala. We have
			spent a lot of time together the
			last few days... you were right
			about several things, Beverly...
			her entire life has been
			orchestrated for this moment...
			but she intends to see it
			through... to help her people end
			this war...
			Are you saying there's nothing
			else that can be done... ?
			It's not that simple.
			I barely even know who she is
			because who she is changes the
			moment the next man walks in the
			room.
			But suddenly, I find myself
			hoping... the next man doesn't
			walk in.
			But he will, of course. In a few
			hours, the ceremony will begin...
			she will mate with a man who cares
			far more about trade agreements
			than about her. And I think of
			how she will be with him... how
			she will change to accomodate
			him... and...
			... I don't like it.
			I'm sorry to be bothering you with
			this...
			I wish I knew how to help you...
			Perhaps I just needed a
			shoulder...
			It's there for you, Jean-Luc.
			It always has been.
			Come in...
			Is it time?
			Soon.
			Do you have any questions about
			the ceremony?
			Many.
			I will never truly love him.
			You've not even met him.
			It no longer matters.
			I wish I could convey to you what
			it's like to be a metamorph...
			to feel the inner strength of
			someone... to realize that being
			with him is opening your mind and
			heart to endless new
			possibilities... to hear yourself
			say: I like myself when I am with
			him.
			Kamala...
			For a metamorph, there is no
			greater pleasure... and no greater
			wish than to bond with that kind
			of mate at the end of the
			Finiis'ral...
			... as I have bonded with you.
			With me?
			Who I am today, I will be forever.
			Data to Captain Picard.
			Not now, Data.
			But sir, Chancellor Alrik is
			waiting to receive you in holodeck
			seven.
			Acknowledged.
			You can't go through with the
			ceremony.
			Would you ask me to stay? And
			ask two armies to keep fighting?
			Having bonded with you I've
			learned the meaning of duty.
			He'll never know. I am still
			empathic... I will be able to
			please him.
			I only hope he likes Shakespeare.
			I am for you Alrik of Valt.
			I'm sorry. I cannot allow this
			to proceed.
			What did you say?
			Kamala will be remaining aboard
			the Enterprise... with me...
			With you?
			Chancellor, the trade agreements

			Very well, let us begin...
			I am for you Alrik of Valt.
			Your service to both our peoples
			is greatly appreciated, Captain...
			Your preparation made the
			negotiations simple, Ambassador...
			and Kamala was able to guide me
			through the rituals...
			I have to admit I'm curious...
			Curious?
			I was chosen for this mission for
			a simple reason... I am two
			hundred years old. The
			temptations of a beautiful
			metamorph do not reach me so
			easily... and yet I would be lying
			if I were to claim, that even at
			my age, they did not reach me at
			all. But you... you had to work
			side by side with her for days...
			how could you resist her... ?
			Ambassador, have a safe trip home.
			Energize.
			Earl Grey. Hot.
