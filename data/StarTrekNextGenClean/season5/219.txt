Captain's log, stardate 45703.9.
We are en route to Earth, where
it will be my pleasant duty to
deliver this year's commencement
address at Starfleet Academy.
I'm also looking forward to seeing
Wesley Crusher again. His flight
team will perform a demonstration
near Saturn that will be
transmitted to the graduation
ceremonies.
Captain, Starfleet Academy is
requesting an update on our
estimated arrival.
Mister Data?
We should arrive at Earth in ten
hours, sixteen minutes, sir.
Please inform the Academy and send
my regards to Superintendant
Brand.
Aye, sir.
Do you know Admiral Brand?
We've met a few times. She's
a... formidable woman.
If she's anything like my
superintendent...
When I was at the Academy, we
had a Vulcan superintendent who
memorized the personnel file of
every single cadet. He knew
everything. It was like having
your parents there with you. All
the time.
My superintendent was a Betazoid
-- a full telepath. When he
called you into his office, he
didn't have to ask what you'd
done.
You got called into the
superintendent's office? That
sounds like a story I'd like to
hear.
Captain, we are being hailed by
the Academy again. It is Admiral
Brand.
On-screen.
Sir, she is requesting a private
channel.
In my ready room.
Admiral Brand... what can I do
for you?
Hello, Captain.
I know you're a close friend of
the Crusher family.
Yes... ?
I wanted to inform you
personally... There's been an
accident.
... he had second degree burns on
his chest and a multiple fracture
of his right arm. But he's going
to be fine.
Have they completed the
regeneration series?
I'm... not certain.
Wesley's allergic to metorapan
treatments... they'll have to use
a bicaridine substitute.
Beverly...
I should send his complete records
to the Academy infirmary... They
probably have them already, but
it never hurts to be sure. I'll
also send them some information
on a new rybotherapy I've been
working on.
Beverly...
He's fine.
I know he's fine... I know he's
fine. Let's talk about something
else.
How did it happen?
Apparently, Wesley's squadron was
practicing on the Academy flight
range near Saturn... they were
in close formation when there
was a collision... all five ships
were destroyed.
Four of the cadets managed to
transport out... one did not.
Do you know who it was?
His name was Joshua Albert.
Wesley talked about him... They
were friends...
Wesley was so excited about making
the flight team... it made me a
little nervous, but I was proud
of him...
... even though I knew there was
always the chance that...
something might...
Beverly. Wesley is alive and
well.
Admiral Brand will be holding a
full briefing after we arrive.
I'll let you know as soon as we're
in orbit.
Thank you.
There was very little left to
salvage from the wreckage. We
did recover one of the ships' data
recorders, but it was badly
damaged. We're attempting to
restore the information, but it's
going to take some time.
Standard procedure calls for an
immediate investigation by two
command-level officers. Captain
Satelk and I will begin taking
depositions from Nova Squadron
at fifteen-hundred hours today.
Commander Albert... I'm sure that
everyone in this room joins me
in conveying my deepest sympathies
to you on the tragic loss of your
son.
Was there any indication of a
problem before the crash? What
exactly were they doing out there?
Did they file a flight plan?
Commander... I'm sorry... right
now, we don't have those answers.
But I assure you we will
investigate this matter
thoroughly.
There will be a memorial service
for Cadet Albert this evening in
the west garden.
It has been suggested that we
should cancel the graduation
ceremonies in light of what's
happened.
Commander Albert and I have
discussed this and we've agreed
that commencement should go
forward as planned. The cadets
should know that even after a
tragedy like this, there are still
duties to perform... and that life
continues. Thank you all for
coming.
It's good to see you again,
Captain. I wish it were under
better circumstances.
It's an unhappy way to begin
commencement. If you require any
assistance, Admiral, the
Enterprise is at your disposal.
I'm sure we can handle the
investigation... but thank you
for the offer.
Commander Albert?
Yes?
Hello, I'm Beverly Crusher. I
just wanted to say... I'm sorry
about your son.
You're Wesley's mother...
Yes.
Josh once told me that Wesley was
the only reason he made it through
astrophysics.
If there's anything I can do...
Wes.
Hi.
How are you feeling, Wesley?
Not too bad... the arm's still
a little sore.
We were so sorry to hear about
Joshua.
Would you like to talk about
it... ?
No. I don't think so. Thank you.
I know you're trying to help,
sir... but it seems like I
haven't talked about anything
else for the past two days. I
don't want to go over it all
again.
I understand. But I want you to
know I'm available if you should
change your mind.
All your friends on the Enterprise
wanted you to know they're
thinking about you... Commander
Riker, Data, Robin Lefler...
everybody.
That's nice.
Come in.
Captain, sir.
At ease, Cadet.
This is my squadron leader,
Nicholas Locarno... This is
Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
Enterprise... my mother, Doctor
Beverly Crusher.
Hello, Doctor... Captain Picard.
Mister Locarno.
I came by to see if Wes had healed
up all right...
How are you doing, Nicholas?
I'm OK.
I... just never lost anyone under
my command before.
I'm afraid it doesn't get any
easier.
Excuse me, Mom, Captain... but
Nick and I have some things to
talk about.
Of course.
If you need anything at all...
I know.
We'll see you at the inquiry.
Good to meet you, Mister Locarno.
You too, sir.
The inquiry is scheduled for
fifteen-hundred hours. Are you
ready?
I think so.
Don't worry about it, Wes.
Everything's going to be all right
-- as long as we stick together.
Boothby?
Jean-Luc Picard... class of
twenty-seven.
I know that. What happened to
your hair?
How are you?
I'm pretty damned cranky, thank
you. I've already replanted this
bed four times this week.
Let me give you a hand...
You?
I've acquired an interest over
the years.
Well, careful you don't plant 'em
too deep... the leaves...
-- will rot...
Something wrong, Cadet?
Nossir, Captain.
Captain Picard... of the
Enterprise, no less... giving the
commencement address...
You sound... surprised...
Surprised? Uh uh. Nothing you
ever did surprised me, son.
Nothing. Except that time you
caught that Ligonian with a
reverse body lift and pinned
him in the first fourteen seconds
of the match... didn't think you
had it in you...
Was all in the legs... from all
the running I used to do...
Boothby...
Hmmm?
I don't know that I've ever really
told you... how much... I
appreciate...
... there's nothing to tell...
Yes, there is... I just wanted
to... while I was here...
You know as well as I do I would
never have made it to graduation
if you hadn't...
You made a mistake. There isn't
a man among us who hasn't been
young enough to make one...
Nevertheless, you...
You knew what you had to do...
I just made sure you listened to
yourself...
At the time I thought you were
a mean-spirited, vicious old man.
I was. By the way, I was about
the same age you are now.
I didn't speak to you for months.
You needed to find your bearings.
I knew that. Important thing is
what you did with your life
afterwards... seems you did
okay... that's all the thanks I
need...
Did you know the boy from Nova
Squadron who was killed?
Josh Albert? Yeah.
Crusher. Hajar. Sito.
Locarno. I know them all.
Nervous?
No.
Yes.
That's okay... so am I.
But we're going to be all right.
We have some tough times ahead...
but we've always come through for
each other.
Whatever happens... I want you
all to know... that leading this
team has been the high point of
my years at the Academy. No one
could have asked for a better
team... or better friends.
Let's go.
... at this point we accelerated
and executed a starboard turn of
twenty-seven degrees. We came out
of the turn on course for Titan.
And you were still in the lead
position?
Yes, sir.
Continue.
As we entered Titan's
gravitational sphere, I gave the
signal to tighten up and move into
a diamond slot formation.
Remaining in the diamond
formation, we executed a low
apogee turn around Titan... then
began a z plus twenty-five degree
climb in preparation for a Yeager
loop.
Approximately nine seconds later,
Cadet Albert's ship collided with
Cadet Hajar's.
We had less than two seconds to
activate our emergency
transporters and beam to the evac
station on Mimas. Everyone made
it... except Josh.
Thank you, Mister Locarno.
Cadet Hajar...
As Team Navigator, you filed a
flight plan with the Academy Range
Officer before the exercise,
correct?
Yes, sir.
Did Nova Squadron deviate from
that flight plan after you entered
the Saturn range?
No, sir.
How do you explain the fact that
the low apogee turn around Titan
was at least two thousand
kilometers closer to the moon than
indicated in your plan?
We were still within flight safety
parameters, sir.
That wasn't my question, Cadet.
We had discussed changing the
approach after I filed the flight
plan. The final decision was made
en route to Saturn. I didn't
consider it significant enough
to mention here.
I apologize for the confusion,
sir. I should have been more
precise.
Did you see Mister Albert's ship
break formation before it collided
with your ship?
No, sir. My first indication of
trouble was when my proximity
alarm went off.
Did any of you see the collision
take place?
No, sir...
Ms. Sito, you were in the tail
position; therefore, you should
have been able to see any sign
of trouble from Cadet Albert...
and yet you saw nothing?
That is correct, sir.
Did your attention falter?
No, sir. I was... flying on
sensor readings at the time...
I did not have visual contact with
Cadet Albert's ship when he broke
formation.
What's wrong?
It's unusual to fly on sensors
alone in that type of maneuver.
A pilot relies on the visual cues
from the other ships to maintain
formation.
If you were flying on sensors
alone, perhaps you could tell us
the orientation of his ship just
before the collision.
I... don't know, sir.
You were flying in a ship
traveling eighty thousand k.p.h.,
with Cadet Albert's ship less than
ten meters away... and you don't
know what his orientation was?
I... don't remember, sir.
Sir, if I may?
Admiral...
Josh was a good pilot... but
lately he'd been having...
difficulties. He would get
nervous during close flybys and
pull away in the final seconds...
his formation flying was a little
erratic.
And you didn't report any of this?
No sir, I didn't. We'd flown
together a long time... I thought
he could handle it if I gave
him a chance. I was wrong.
Then you're saying that the
accident was Cadet Albert's fault?
I think Josh got frightened and
tried to pull out of the turn
prematurely... and then crashed
into Cadet Hajar.
Josh was our friend... we didn't
want him to be remembered as
someone who panicked.
Please be seated.
I am... disturbed by what I've
heard here today. By your own
admission, you allowed your
teammate to fly when you knew he
was having difficulties
maintaining formation. That
demonstrates a serious lack of
judgment.
I am also disturbed by the fact
that you did not come forward with
this information immediately.
We should have the first data
from Mister Crusher's flight
recorder tonight. We will
reconvene at thirteen hundred
hours tomorrow.
Everything's fine. Trust me.
Captain, the Academy has one of
the best reconstructive analysis
labs in Starfleet. I'm not sure
we'll have much to contribute to
the investigation.
That may well be the case.
However...
Wesley is one of our own.
Understood, sir. We'll get right
on it.
Good. I've spoken with Admiral
Brand and she has agreed to allow
us access to all of the physical
evidence and testimony.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Computer, initiate a link between
this station and the Starfleet
Academy Database.
You shouldn't have said it, Nick.
Josh wasn't responsible for what
happened.
I had to do something...
You said we wouldn't have to lie
to them. We all agreed not to
lie to them.
I didn't lie. Everything I said
was true.
The accident was not Josh's fault.
Look... he was my friend, too.
I worked to get him on this team.
But the truth is... he panicked.
We don't know that...
Of course we do... none of us has
wanted to say it out loud... but
we've all had the same thought.
Haven't we?
He must have pulled away too soon.
I think he got scared.
Sito?
Wes... I know you want to protect
his memory... we all do. But --
we have to look out for
ourselves now.
What do you want us to do, walk in
and tell them everything that
happened?
We might as well turn in our
uniforms and start packing our
bags.
Are we ready for that?
We'll take this one step at a
time.
This is the preliminary report
on your flight recorder.
It was so badly damaged in the
crash, the lab was only able to
retrieve a third of the total
telemetry on the recorder... and
all of it is from before the
collision.
There is no problem here.
Nick... I don't think I can do
this.
You don't have to lie... just
don't volunteer any new
information.
The first night I met you, Wes...
I knew I wanted you on this squad.
I knew what you'd bring to it...
you, more than any of the others,
would understand what it means
to be able to count on someone.
You've been out there, putting
yourself on the line... you know
you've got to be able to trust
the people on your team...
because your life is in their
hands.
And their lives are in yours.
We made a promise, right in the
beginning, that we'd stick
together. We were Nova Squadron
-- nobody else could say that.
And even after we graduated we'd
try to get posted to the same
duty... we were going to be a
team -- for a long time.
Josh can't be a part of those
plans anymore. But I think he'd
still want us to be a team.
What do you think?
Mister Crusher?
Sir.
At ease.
Am I interrupting?
No, sir. I was just going over
my deposition for tomorrow.
They told me... I could find you
here.
I... found this in Josh's room...
I... I think it belongs to you.
The ski trip...
We went to Calgary last month...
Josh forgot his sweater... so he
borrowed one of mine.
He told me you... helped him with
his classes.
A little... he only needed help
with statistical mechanics.
If Josh had one weakness, it was
mathematics...
He could do it...
He just didn't like to.
His mother and I thought he'd
never make it out of calculus.
Then he found out what the Academy
entrance requirements were like...
that turned him around. He stayed
after class, got a tutor... he
worked really hard.
He never gave up on anything...
I... I know that... he had a lot
of respect for you, and everyone
on the team. I realize this was
his fault... and that... you
could've all been killed. I...
I wanted to... to say...
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.
I'm sorry he let you down.
Are you ready, Mister Crusher?
Yes, sir.
This is the beginning of our run
toward Titan. I'm on the right
wing.
Where was Mister Albert at this
point?
He was on my port quarter, about
fifty meters away.
We just received the signal to
begin the diamond slot formation.
That's Cadet Locarno coming into
view.
We're in a twenty degree turn,
coming around Titan...
We should be coming out of Titan's
gravity well about now...
That is the extent of the data
we were able to recover from the
flight recorder. Mister Crusher,
will you describe what happened
after you left orbit of Titan?
Once we'd cleared the moon...
Mister Locarno led us into a
Yeager loop... about nine seconds
later, everything seemed to happen
at once: the proximity alarm went
off, I tried to veer away, but
it was too late... I was hit...
I lost control of the ship and
a power coupling exploded in the
cockpit... I don't know how, but
I managed to activate my escape
transporter... the next thing
I remember was finding myself in
the emergency evac station on
Mimas with the rest of the
squadron... except Josh.
Do you have anything to add to
your testimony?
No, sir.
Mister Crusher, will you describe
a Yeager loop?
The ships begin in a diamond slot
formation. They climb and loop
backwards at a steep angle... at
the peak of the loop, all five
ships flip over and accelerate
in a new direction.
Mister Crusher, did your team
remain in formation throughout
the loop?
Yes, sir.
I want you to be absolutely clear
on this point, Mister Crusher.
Before the collision, was Nova
Squadron in a diamond slot
formation?
Yes, sir.
Computer, display Saturn NavCon
file six dash three seven nine.
These images were obtained by a
navigational control satellite
in orbit around Saturn during a
standard sensor sweep.
Computer, freeze image.
Magnify sector gamma three and
enhance.
This image was recorded when your
ships moved briefly into the
satellite's sensor range.
According to the time index,
what you see on the monitor took
place seven seconds after Nova
Squadron completed the Yeager loop.
Mister Crusher, are these ships
in a diamond slot formation?
No, sir.
What is your explanation, Mister
Crusher?
I have none.
Everything's going to be okay,
Wes. There's got to be an
explanation for all this.
Data and Geordi are already
analyzing the flight recorder and
the satellite transmission.
Why?
There must be something wrong
with the satellite data... it
might have been tampered with...
Mom... that doesn't make any
sense...
Well there has to be some
explanation... I know you're
telling the truth... but that
satellite data made it look like
you were lying.
I've spoken with the other
parents...
I'm going to go to Admiral Brand
and ask that she delay the inquiry
for at least--
Mom. No.
You can't do that.
I'm not going to let them destroy
your career, Wes... you haven't
done anything wrong.
Don't try to protect me, Mom...
Please just... stay out of it.
Look at this... weeds keep
popping up in the primrose
beds... poor flowers never have
a chance to grow...
You could use a good herbicide
instead of crawling about on your
hands and knees pulling weeds.
And you could explore space on
a holodeck instead of a
starship.
Boothby... tell me more about
Nova Squadron.
Not going well is it?
No.
Remember the parrises squares
tournament in 'twenty four?
That final game against Minsk...
It took me three weeks to repair
the grounds after the celebration.
We had a lot to celebrate. Our
team wasn't supposed to win.
We were proud of them...
Well... the cadets today are just
as proud of Nova Squadron. The
celebration they held after Nova
won the Rigel Cup made 'twenty-four
look like a dinner party.
To the other cadets, the members
of that team are gods... and
that's a hard image to live up
to. But Nick Locarno... he
watches out for them... he keeps
them together.
Nick is what makes that team
special... he's their coach,
surrogate father, and best friend
all in one... a natural leader.
The members of that team love
him... if he asks them to do
something, they do it... even
if it means going right over a
cliff.
He all but admitted to me that
he was lying.
What exactly did he say?
He just asked me not to help
him... but it was the way he said
it ... the look on his face...
Jean-Luc, I know my son, and he's
in trouble.
Report.
Nothing conclusive.
We do know the collision occurred
about four seconds after the
satellite images were recorded.
But we still don't know how the
ships got into the new formation
or how the crash occurred.
We have unsuccessfully tried over
fifty different computational
models in an effort to simulate
the movements of Nova Squadron
just prior to the crash.
There're just too many variables
to take into consideration...
speed, attitude, course...
Did Wesley's flight recorder
indicate there was anything...
unusual about the ship or the way
it was operating?
Well, the starboard power flow
was fluctuating.
However, it was well within
operational limits.
The fluidic pressure in the
landing struts was low, but I
don't know what difference that
would make.
We did find that Wesley had
opened his coolant interlock just
before beginning the maneuver
around Titan.
Which is a little unusual. The
interlock is normally closed
unless you're performing a check
on the engine coolant levels.
But there's no evidence Wesley
was running that kind of check.
Filling the primary coolant tanks
requires an open interlock...
but that can only be done in a
maintenance bay. What other
reasons are there to open that
valve?
It's the first step in purging
the plasma exhaust.
That procedure would be extremely
hazardous while the ship was in
flight.
Yeah, the engine would probably
ignite the plasma.
Ignite the plasma... that's
exactly what they were trying to
do.
Come.
Captain.
Can you tell me what maneuver this
is?
It's the Kolvoord Starburst.
Five ships crossing within ten
meters of each other and then
igniting their plasma trails.
One of the most difficult and
spectacular demonstrations of
precision flying. It hasn't been
performed by an Academy team in
over a century. Do you know why?
It was banned by the Academy
following a training accident.
An accident in which all five
cadets lost their lives.
Nicholas Locarno wanted to end
his Academy career in a blaze of
glory... so he convinced the four
of you to learn the Kolvoord
Starburst for the commencement
demonstration. If it worked,
you'd thrill the assembled
guests... and Locarno would
graduate as a living legend.
Except it didn't work... and
Joshua Albert paid the price.
Am I correct?
I asked you a question, Cadet.
I... choose not to answer, sir.
You choose not to answer... and
yet you've already given an answer
to the inquiry... and that answer
was a lie.
I said the accident occurred after
the loop, and it did.
But you neglected to mention the
fact that following the loop your
team executed a dangerous maneuver
which was the direct cause of the
crash.
Yes, you told the truth... but
only to a point. And a lie of
omission is still a lie.
Do you remember the day you first
came aboard this ship? Your
mother brought you to the
bridge...
Yes.
You even sat in my chair. It
annoyed me at first... a
presumptuous child playing on my
ship. But I never forgot the way
you knew every control and
display before you ever set foot
on the bridge. You acted like
you belonged there.
I remember.
Later... when I decided to make
you an acting ensign, I was
convinced you would be an
outstanding officer. I've never
questioned that conviction...
until now.
The first duty of every Starfleet
officer is to the truth... be it
scientific truth, historical
truth, or personal truth. It is
the guiding principle upon which
Starfleet is based. If you cannot
find it within yourself to stand
up and tell the truth about what
happened... you do not deserve
to wear that uniform.
Mister Crusher... I'll make this
simple for you. Either you come
forward and tell Admiral Brand
what really took place... or I
will.
Captain...
Dismissed.
Your message said it was urgent...
They know, Nick. They know what
we did.
Calm down... now tell me exactly
what happened.
Captain Picard called me to the
Enterprise... when I got there
he said he'd figured it out...
the Kolvoord manuever, the
cover-up, everything. He said
that if I didn't come forward now
and tell the truth... he would.
You said he'd "figured it out"...
did he have any evidence?
No... but he still knew exactly
what happened.
Captain Picard doesn't know
anything... he has a theory. Let
him tell the inquiry what he
thinks happened... they'll ask
us, "Is it true?" and we'll say,
"No, sir". There's no evidence,
so there's no case... and we'll
get off with a reprimand.
You're asking me to call Captain
Picard a liar.
Wesley... we just have to hold
on a little longer... then this
will all be over.
It's wrong...
Wesley...
No. I'm going to tell them what
happened.
You're going to tell them what
happened. You. Alone. Are going
to decide what happens to me...
to Sito... to Jean. You're going
to decide that.
I'm not going to lie to them
again, Nick... I can't live with
it.
You can't lie to them... you can't
live with it... you have to tell
them what happened. Who the hell
are you?
Nick...
You're going to turn us in?
Hey, wait a minute...
No, you wait a minute...
He got to you, didn't he? Picard
gave you a big speech about duty
and honor...
It must've been a pretty good
speech to make you want to turn
your back on your friends.
We're Starfleet cadets, we have
a duty to the truth.
What about your duty to your
friends?
I got you on this team... I gave
you a chance when there were
upperclassmen waiting in line.
I said, "He won't let us down.
He was on the Enterprise. He
knows what it's like to trust
somebody with his life." I guess
I was wrong...
Nick, if we all come forward
together... tell Admiral Brand---
We don't want to come forward...
Sito and Jean and me... we don't
have a problem with this.
But if you do... then resign your
appointment to the Academy and
walk away. Don't make us pay for
your guilty conscience.
You'd let me do it, wouldn't you?
You'd let me throw my career away
just to save your neck.
To save the team. That's more
important than you and it's more
important than me.
And if I was in your place... I'd
do it. Without hesitation.
But that's me.
Captain Satelk and I have gone
over your testimony and the
physical evidence from the crash.
Your statements cannot be
reconciled with the data collected
from the NavCon satellite.
Your unwillingness to offer any
explanation for this contradiction
is disappointing, and it raises
suspicion. We cannot escape the
conclusion that either the data
is faulty in some way... or you
have lied to us.
However... suspicion is not
proof... and I have no proof that
you have lied to this inquiry.
Therefore... unless further
evidence is presented, I have no
choice but to close this
investigation.
For filing an inaccurate flight
plan, and for allowing Cadet
Albert to fly despite the fact
that you knew he had been having
difficulties, I am ordering a
formal reprimand placed on each
of your permanent records. I am
also revoking your flight
privileges.
This inquiry is closed.
Sir... I would like to add
something to my testimony.
Proceed, Mister Crusher.
Yesterday, I testified that the
crash occurred following a Yeager
loop. That's not entirely true.
We did perform the loop. But
after that, we broke formation...
and attempted a Kolvoord
Starburst.
We knew it was prohibited and that
it would be dangerous, but we
wanted to do something spectacular
for the commencement
demonstration... So we pushed
Josh... and he wasn't ready.
We thought we could do it... we
thought we could do anything.
We were wrong... and Josh died.
Josh didn't let us down, sir.
It wasn't his fault.
Cadet Sito, is this true?
Yes, sir.
Cadet Hajar?
Yes, sir.
Mister Locarno, you're the leader
of Nova Squadron... do you have
anything to say?
Mister Locarno?
No, sir.
Mister Locarno has been expelled.
They should've expelled all of
us.
They almost did. But... Mister
Locarno made an impassioned plea
for the rest of you. He said he
used his influence as squadron
leader to convince you all to
try the Kolvoord maneuver and
then to cover up the truth.
He asked to take full
responsibility.
He did exactly what he said he
would -- he protected the team.
I feel awful... I've let everybody
down... my friends, Mom, you.
You should feel bad... and you
will pay for what you did.
Admiral Brand has decided that,
in addition to a formal reprimand,
your academic credits for the past
year will be cancelled and you will
not advance with your class.
I understand.
It won't be easy... staying here
on campus with everyone knowing
what you did... I think you have
some rough times ahead.
Yes, sir.
Captain... thank you.
You knew what you had to do...
I just made sure you listened
to yourself.
Good-bye, Cadet.
Good-bye, Captain.
