Captain's log, stardate 45429.3.
While on a mapping survey of
sector two-two-one-three-nine, we
are conveying a delegation of
Ullians to Kaldra Four. These
telepathic historians conduct their
research by retrieving long-forgotten
memories.
It's a chipped cup, off-white...
with a crack in it... I can see
it... but I can't remember
anything else about it...
When you see it... do you hear
any sounds?
No... I don't think so... wait,
yes...
Humming...
Someone's humming...
A woman.
Yes... but I don't know who it
is...
Try to touch the cup.
It has a sharp edge where it's
chipped.
Is there anything inside the cup?
A liquid... dark...
Like tea...
It's not hot...
Bitter...
There's something else in the
cup...
Yes... with a wooden handle...
A spoon...
No... It's more delicate than
that.
Reach for it.
It's a brush! An ink brush.
I hear that humming again.
Keep listening to it, and hold
out the brush. See if someone
takes it from you.
It's Obachan! My grandmother.
She's doing brush writing. I
remember it now!
She used that cup for cleaning
the brush, and it was my job to
fill it with water and bring it
to the table.
I'd sit beside her and watch the
most beautiful characters come
from that brush. And the whole
time, she'd be humming to herself.
It's like it was yesterday.
You remember such vivid details...
it's remarkable.
For years I've seen that old cup
in my memory... but I could never
recall what it was or why it was
important.
Thank you.
You're very welcome, young lady.
Perhaps someone else would care
to try?
You, madam... you're thinking of
that first childhood kiss.
Wouldn't you like to remember
more about it?
Father, you know you're not
supposed to probe someone's
memories unless they've given you
permission.
You're right... but sometimes with
a beautiful woman -- I can't help
myself.
What about you, Commander? Any
memories you feel like digging
up?
None that I'd want to share with
an audience.
I'd better be going... it's
getting late.
Captain's log, supplemental.
Reports of the Ullians' remarkable
feats have piqued my interest.
I have invited the senior staff
to a Captain's Dinner in honor
of our guests.
It is perplexing to me that the
Ullians' ability to retrieve
memory is so sought after. If
an event is important enough to
be recovered... why would it have
been forgotten?
It's not quite the same for us
as it is for you, Data. You
record every second of every event
in your life...
That is correct.
And if you want to recall any one
of those seconds, you just access
the proper memory circuit.
My understanding of the Human
brain suggests that the process
is the same for you.
Each memory is encoded in chains
of molecules, and when you want
to retrieve it, you simply access
the proper RNA sequence.
Well, yeah, that's true...
Then in what way is it different?
Sometimes... There are memories
we just can't tap into. For
instance... I have no recollection
of what I did on my last birthday.
Birthdays are important
occasions... you'd think I'd
remember how I spent the day.
But I can't even remember where
I was.
Deck two. On the other hand --
I remember everything about the
time I got my first pet... a
Circassian cat. I was eight. I
remember how funny he looked...
how excited I was... it's as if
it happened last week.
Perhaps you remember the pleasant
memories and forget the unpleasant
ones?
Well, not really. Sometimes the
bad memories are the most intense
of all.
It would seem there is no
predictable pattern to Human
memory.
It would seem.
This "library" of ours has been
in the planning stages for years
-- a collection of the retrieved
memories of races from many
different star systems --
What my son means to say is --
we think of ourselves as
"archaeologists of the mind." We
believe that the history of a
world is contained in the personal
experiences of its people.
Rather like the ancient oral
historians of Earth.
Exactly. The library we propose
will be a vast storehouse of these
individual memories.
Sounds like quite a project...
how long will it take to finish
your studies on Kaldra?
Many months. We have been working
for years, and have surveyed only
eleven planets in eight star
systems.
But it's our way of life. We
wouldn't want to do anything else.
Captain, Mister Tarmin gave us
a demonstration of his abilities
this afternoon. It's fascinating.
Perhaps you'd like to resurrect
some memories...
I'd be happy to probe your
recollections, Captain. Most
people find it an enjoyable
experience.
I'm sure. However, I don't think
I'm a particularly good candidate
--
I'm sure you'd be ideal. And you
must have some intriguing
memories...
We won't be on your ship for long.
This might be your last
opportunity...
Yes, well...
Tarmin, you mustn't influence
people. They must come to you
willingly.
I have found... over the years...
that there are many who want the
experience of memory retrieval...
but who need some encouragement
in order to come forward.
You, Mister Worf? I would love
to explore Klingon memories.
Klingons do not allow themselves
to be "probed."
There is nothing to fear...
Father...
I am not fearful.
Commander LaForge... you?
I don't think so. Thanks anyway.
I have rarely encountered such
squeamish people! Doctor
Crusher... Commander Riker... ?
Mister Tarmin, are all Ullians
able to read memories?
No, my dear. The technique
requires special training. It
is a serious commitment.
It takes years of study. Tarmin
is the most proficient of our
group.
Once Jev spent two days with a
contingent of elderly Gentons.
He couldn't get a thing from them.
I worked with them for one hour
and recovered a missing fragment
of the Gentonian trade wars.
Excuse me.
Exactly how long will it be before
we reach Kaldra, Captain?
Mister Data?
Four days, eleven hours, sir.
Jev...
I'm sorry. I'm being rude.
No, not at all...
My father finds it amusing to
demean me in public. I reach the
point where I don't want to hear
any more.
It's not easy having an
overbearing parent. Believe me,
I know how you feel.
Oh, yes... I was told you were
an empath.
I can't read Ullians. But, I
do know a certain Betazoid mother
who is a great deal like your
father.
Deck eight. I've learned to
remind myself that my mother and
I are two separate individuals.
Deck sixteen. And have you had
much success with this approach,
Counselor?
No... but I keep reminding myself.
Good night.
Good night, Counselor. And thank
you.
Have you stopped thinking about
us?
Hot chocolate.
Have you stopped thinking about
us?
Will...
We have to talk about this...
Imzadi... we can't... not when
we're serving on the same ship...
Have you stopped thinking about
us? Just answer that...
I can't stop thinking about you...
No... don't...
Have you stopped thinking about
us?
Will... we mustn't do this...
No, Will --
Imzadi...
No, don't...
I can't stop thinking about
you...
Imzadi...
Don't do this... !
Have you stopped thinking about
us?
No... no... no...
Captain's log, stardate 45430.9.
Counselor Troi has fallen into
a deep coma. After a thorough
examination, Doctor Crusher has
been unable to find any sign of
illness or infection.
Any change, Doctor?
No. I'm still getting unusual
neurotransmitter readings in the
diencephalon... but they might
be a result of the coma...
Can you bring her out of it?
I've tried standard revival
techniques... she doesn't
respond. Until I know what caused
this, I don't want to try anything
more extreme.
Do we know what she was doing when
this happened?
No. She was found in her quarters
this morning when she didn't show
up for an appointment.
She was dressed for bed... but
the bed wasn't slept in.
Who was the last person to speak
with her?
She left the dinner last night
with one of the Ullians.
I'll talk to him.
I'll check the biofilter readings
from the Ullians' transporter logs.
It's possible they could still be
carrying some harmful organism.
Commander, ask if they would
consent to examinations -- just
to be certain.
May I join you?
Commander... of course...
Something's wrong...
Counselor Troi is ill.
I'm sorry to hear it...
More than ill... she's in a coma.
Doctor Crusher doesn't know what's
causing it or how to treat her.
When did it happen?
Apparently some time last night.
That's why I wanted to talk to
you... you may have been the last
person to see her. Did you go
with her into her quarters?
Are you suggesting I behaved
improperly, Commander?
Not at all... I'm just trying to
trace her steps.
We talked briefly -- in a
turbolift. She got off at deck
eight. I did not go with her.
Jev -- I'm not accusing you of
anything.
Did she mention feeling ill?
No. She seemed fine.
She has a wonderful sense of
humor.
If you have no objection, Doctor
Crusher would like to examine you
and your group...
To what end?
She'd like to eliminate the
possibility that one of you might
be carrying some organism that
was harmful to Deanna.
I'm not implying that you've done
anything intentional. I am just
trying to get to the bottom of
a mystery...
We have nothing to hide. If you
wish to spend time examining us...
Fine. Thank you.
Deanna... I don't know if you can
hear me.
I've heard doctors say that even
when someone's in a coma, they
may be able to hear when people
talk to them... that it might
even help stimulate the brain
and speed the healing...
In fact, I think you did that for
me once, when I was in pretty
bad shape...
So I just thought... maybe it
would help to hear a friendly
voice...
... even if you don't know you're
hearing it.
We've been busy mapping the
sector... it's pretty routine.
So far the most unusual thing
we've seen is a binary star
system... I finished that
personnel review we were working
on... you can check it over when
you...
... wake up.
I miss you. So don't stay away
too long, okay?
Will... ?
Will... I promise I'll let you
know the minute she regains
consciousness.
I know...
There's nothing you can do here.
You're going to wear yourself
out...
Right...
It's late... go to bed.
That's an order.
Keller is still in there!
Out, out, out! Let's go!
Antimatter injection breach.
Evacuate immediately.
Ensign Keller, can you hear me?
Yes, sir...
Come on, move it!
Commander, I need to bring that
door down!
Keller, can you get to a Jeffries
Tube?
Ensign Keller, answer me.
You killed her.
Keller is still in there!
Commander, radiation levels are
critical -- we've gotta seal it
off.
She was right behind me!
Bring down the door!
Out, out out! Let's go!
Keller is still in there.
Keller is still in there.
Riker to transporter room three.
Prepare to beam Ensign Keller out
of the engine room.
I can't lock onto her signal,
Commander.
Keller is still in there.
Keller is still in there.
You killed her.
Ensign Keller, answer me.
You killed her.
I've gotta get the isolation door
down!
Keller is still in there.
Bring down the door!
You killed her.
You killed her.
You killed her.
I need that door down!
Keller is still in there.
You killed her.
Bridge to Commander Riker...
Commander, do you read me?
Picard to Commander Riker, answer
please.
Computer, locate Commander Riker.
Commander Riker is in his
quarters.
On my way, sir.
Medical log, stardate 45431.7.
Commander Riker is the second
officer who has fallen into an
unexplained coma. I have examined
the Ullians and ruled out the
possibility that they carry a
harmful organism.
I compared Deanna's brain scan
to one I took during her last
physical. There is a
difference... this time there's
a trace of electropathic activity.
And Commander Riker?
I found the same pattern. If I
didn't know better, I'd think they
had Iresine Syndrome. It's the
only medical condition that would
produce that pattern.
What is Iresine Syndrome?
A very rare neurological disorder
first diagnosed in the
twenty-third century. It's
characterized by an identical
electropathic residue.
Then why discount the possibility
that it's responsible for their
comas?
Iresine is always accompanied by
a severely decreased histamine
count. Both Will and Deanna show
normal levels.
I've asked Commander LaForge to
conduct a shipwide diagnostic
for any other agents which could
produce that electropathic
pattern.
Counselor Troi and Commander Riker
were in perfect health -- until
the Ullians got here.
It would be wise to quarantine
the aliens.
I believe it's premature to take
that kind of action. We have no
real evidence linking these comas
to the Ullians.
That's true. But there is
something curious...
The electropathic residue I
discovered is located in the
thalamus. That's the area of the
cerebral cortex which involves
memory function.
I've been accused of putting
people to sleep with one too many
stories, Captain... but this is
the first time it's been suggested
that I might be responsible for
someone's coma.
I mean no disrespect, sir. But
we are faced with an alarming
situation...
Why do you suspect us, Captain?
Suspect is perhaps too strong a
word. I am simply trying to
determine what has caused two of
my officers to fall into comas.
You've already examined us...
we aren't carrying anything
harmful...
But in further study of the
victims, I noticed some abnormal
patterns in the area of the brain
which involves memory.
In light of your particular
telepathic abilities, it does
raise the question...
Captain... it's not our wish to
obstruct you. What would you
like?
If I could do further examinations
tomorrow... perhaps monitor you
during a memory probe...
Scrutiny does not frighten us.
We will be happy to cooperate,
Doctor.
Thank you. I'll contact you
tomorrow morning.
You're the only person on board
who's undergone a memory probe
by the Ullians. I'd like to do
a neurological work-up... see
if I can detect any residual
effect.
I'm happy to help...
Doctor Martin will monitor your
vital signs while I do the scan.
Have you had any unusual symptoms
since the probe? Headaches?
Dizziness?
No, nothing like that. It was
a wonderful experience...
Electrical activity is normal...
CPK levels are normal... the
hippocampus is stable... and the
thalamus...
... the thalamus is normal.
There's no indication at all of
the electropathic residue.
Is that good?
You're fine, Keiko. But we're
no closer to solving this mystery.
Computer, locate the electropathic
pattern described in medical
database four-delta-one.
Electropathic pattern located.
Okay, we're gonna track down any
possible cause of that brain
pattern. First, what are the
medical conditions that might
account for it?
Iresine Syndrome is a cause of
the electropathic pattern.
Right. And Doctor Crusher's
already eliminated that. How many
nonmedical forces or substances
might cause the pattern?
There are twenty-two nonmedical
agents.
Okay. And how many of those are
present on the Enterprise?
None is present on the Enterprise.
Are the ship's sensors calibrated
to detect all those agents?
All agents are scanned by the
sensors.
Okay. Let's start with the
chemical substances. Name them.
Ferrazene, hylanatine, dardilion,
chrysimite, and manzene.
Ferrazene has a complex molecular
structure... it breaks down into
bilenium and tarrisite. Do the
sensors scan for those?
Ship's sensors scan for both
compounds.
And are they present on the
Enterprise?
Bilenium and tarrisite are not
present.
Do any of the substances break
down into by-products that are
not scanned for?
Dardilion contains the byproduct
nilizene. Sensors do not
routinely scan for that substance.
Well, this isn't a routine
situation. Scan for nilizene.
There is no nilizene on the
Enterprise.
Why did I know you were going to
say that?
Okay. Let's move on to
nonchemical agents.
Anything more I can do for you?
No, thanks. I was just doing some
reading on Iresine Syndrome. If
a new strain has developed, that
might explain the normal histamine
count.
Any luck?
Not so far.
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
You shouldn't remember him like
this.
You don't have to do this...
It's important to me. I have to
see him.
It's good of you to come with me.
It's the least I can do...
You shouldn't remember him like
this.
I have to face the fact that he's
gone.
I have to see him.
You shouldn't remember him like
this...
It's good of you to come with me.
It's the least I can do...
You don't have to do this...
It's important to me.
You shouldn't remember him like
this...
It's the least I can do...
I've spent two hours having a cozy
chat with the computer. I've
checked everything I can think
of -- any possible agent that
might cause that electropathic
pattern.
I would assume from the tone of
your voice that you were
unsuccessful.
Didn't find a thing.
And the Doctor's not gonna like
hearing that --
Emergency medical team to Doctor
Crusher's office immediately.
Doctor Crusher had me working on
a shipwide diagnostic. I'd gone
to give her the results when I
found her.
Did your scans provide any
insights into these comas?
None. I checked and
cross-checked... they were just
dead ends.
We seem to have eliminated all
known factors that could have
caused the comas -- except for
the Ullians.
Mister Data, I want you to
investigate those eleven planets
the Ullians have visited. See
if there have been any reports
of unexplained comas.
Yes, Captain.
In the meantime, we must consider
restricting them to their
quarters. As a precautionary
measure...
If one of them is behind this...
will keeping telepaths in their
quarters prevent it from happening
again?
What else can we do? Station a
guard? Set up a force field?
I don't know if those would be
any more effective...
Sickbay to Captain Picard.
Picard here...
Sir... Counselor Troi has regained
consciousness.
I'm on my way.
It's like waking up from a
nightmare... but not remembering
what it was about.
What's the last thing you do
remember?
My hair... I was brushing my hair.
And then... ?
I don't know... just... waking
up here...
Why do I feel so frightened? What
happened to me?
We were hoping you could tell us.
How long have I been here?
Three days.
Three days... ?
You were the first. The next day
Commander Riker fell into a
similar coma... and last night
-- Doctor Crusher.
What is going on here... ?
We aren't certain.
It may be... that there is some
unusual effect produced by the
Ullians' telepathic activity.
I'm going to talk to them. In
the meantime, you're to stay here
and recuperate. And if you
remember anything about what
happened to you... let me know
immediately.
What are you suggesting, Captain?
That you voluntarily confine
yourself to quarters. At least
until we unravel this mystery.
We're to be prisoners?
Father...
Please don't think of it that way.
We have done everything we can
think of to explain these comas.
We've performed physical
examinations and neurological
scans... we have conducted a
shipwide diagnostic, looking for
viruses and parasites and
infestations...
We have investigated every
possible cause we can imagine.
And we have found nothing --
nothing -- to explain the comas.
The only variable we cannot
eliminate... is your presence
on this ship.
In light of these efforts, I ask
you to understand my request.
And to honor it.
Captain... our history indicates
that we do not adversely affect
the people we contact.
I know that.
Then... are you implying an
intentional assault?
I am simply trying to consider
all possibilities.
Surely you would give us the
chance to prove that we are
innocent?
If that is possible, of course.
Then... I would propose doing a
memory probe of Counselor Troi.
You've said she doesn't remember
what happened to her before she
lapsed into unconsciousness. I
could retrieve that memory...
There's a possibility it could
explain the coma -- and prove us
innocent.
I'm sorry. But I cannot subject
the Counselor to a potentially
dangerous procedure.
And I will not be a party to any
of these proceedings.
Jev is making a reasonable
request, Captain. If we're to
be accused, surely we're entitled
to a defense.
Tarmin did a memory probe on
another of your crew... Has she
suffered any ill effects?
No...
And neither will Counselor Troi.
Please... have as many people
present as you like to guarantee
her safety... but give us this
chance to vindicate ourselves.
I will discuss the matter with
the Counselor.
Well, that's it for Melina Two.
No unexplained comas during the
time the Ullians were working
there. We're striking out
everywhere.
We have yet to receive
transmissions from the two planets
of the Nel system. Perhaps they
will show different results.
Maybe...
Or maybe... we're not checking
for the right thing.
Please clarify.
We didn't look into the comas
that were explained.
Why would we do that?
Remember what Doctor Crusher said
right after Counselor Troi became
unconscious? That it looked
exactly like Iresine syndrome
except for the histamine count?
Yes.
Maybe not every medical facility
is as careful as Doctor Crusher.
Maybe it's easier to give a quick
diagnosis to something than to
keep hunting for the real cause.
You are checking for instances
of Iresine Syndrome...
Right... and correlating them with
visits by the Ullians --
-- and there we are.
Two cases of Iresine Syndrome on
Hurada Three -- right at the time
Tarmin and his group was there.
Let's try the other planets. I
think we may have something.
Counselor, I want to reiterate...
if you have any doubts about this
procedure, you don't have to
go through with it.
I want to do it, Captain.
Something awful happened to me...
and I can't even remember what
it was.
Very well.
Counselor... what's the last thing
you remember that night?
Brushing my hair...
Would you get your hairbrush?
Tell me about brushing your
hair... do you do it every night?
Yes... when I'm ready for bed...
What is it?
Someone... touching my hair...
Someone's with you in the room?
No... I'm alone. No one's there.
I get some hot chocolate...
Something's happening...
I'm alone in my quarters... and
I'm remembering something from
a few years ago...
Go back... into that memory...
you said someone was touching
your hair... ?
Yes... and...
It's Will Riker... that's right...
I was thinking of him...
Remembering a time when you were
with him...
Yes... after a poker game...
It's a pleasant memory... stay
with it...
... but now he's hurting me...
no...
You're frightened...
I want him to stop...
It's not Will... somebody's taken
his place...
Someone else is there? Who is
it?
No... no... he shouldn't be
there... why is he there? No...
no... he's hurting me...
Can you see his face... ?
Yes...
Imzadi...
No... stop... you're hurting me...
Who is it? Who's doing this to
you?
It's Tarmin... it's your father!
Captain's log, stardate 45433.2.
We have set a course for Starbase
Four-forty, where the Ullians will
disembark and return to their home
planet.
Inad and I have contacted our home
planet. If you want to prosecute
my father, the authorities there
will support you.
I'm not sure we have any legal
basis for prosecution... memory
invasion simply isn't a crime
we've ever had to contend with.
According to what I've just
learned... it was a practice that
was abolished on our world
centuries ago.
What would motivate someone like
your father to commit such an act?
I don't know. A perverse source
of pleasure... a way to exercise
control over another... ?
Your father claims -- quite
strenuously -- that he is
innocent.
My father has never been one to
admit that he's wrong.
But it's hard to believe he would
be capable of this.
This must be very hard for you.
I am told... that the punishment
for this crime is quite severe.
We are monitoring his telepathic
activity. You have my assurance
that he won't assault anyone
else.
I am sorry for this, Captain.
Picard to Data.
Yes, Captain.
How's your search coming?
We have uncovered several cases,
sir, but we have not yet completed
our search.
We'll want to inform the medical
personnel on those planets that
we have discovered the true nature
of the comas. I'm sure they would
appreciate knowing what really
happened.
We will keep searching, sir.
We just got the transmission from
the Nel system. No mention of
Iresine Syndrome... but there are
two unexplained comas on one
planet... none on the other.
And were the Ullians present?
Checking their mission logs...
That's funny...
What is it?
On stardates 45321 and 45323, when
the comas occurred... Tarmin was
on his home planet.
He wasn't anywhere near the Nel
system.
Come in.
Hello, Jev.
We'll be reaching the starbase
soon. I wanted to say good-bye...
and to apologize again for my
father.
There's no need... you're not
responsible for what he did.
Before all this happened... I had
hoped we might become friends.
We still can...
After what he's put you through?
Maybe you can forget... I'm not
sure I can.
You are so lovely...
I have to go. Good-bye.
Jev... you're upset. Would you
like to talk?
No...
You'd feel better if you did...
Why do you have to be so nice...
So lovely...
What... what's happening... ?
It's happening again...
You are so beautiful... so
fragile...
It was you... it was always you...
Have you stopped thinking about
us?
No...
Imzadi...
Imzadi...
No -- no --
No -- I won't let you!
Let go of her!
Counselor, are you hurt?
No... why... why did you come
here? How did you know?
We discovered two instances of
unexplained comas on Nel Three
while the Ullians were there...
but Tarmin was not part of the
group. A closer examination
revealed that only one Ullian was
present at all incidents of coma
-- Jev.
Captain's log, stardate 45435.8.
Doctor Crusher and Commander Riker
regained consciousness while we
were en route to the Ullian home
world. The slow process of their
recovery has begun.
I have asked that the finest
physicians on my world meet with
you all upon our return... to help
you in your healing process.
They have been in contact with
us already. Thank you...
It has been three centuries since
anyone was treated for this...
this form of rape. But there are
medical records from that era...
It was a time of great violence
among my people... a time we
thought we had left far behind.
That this could happen now...
is unimaginable.
Earth was once a violent planet,
too. At times, the chaos seemed
to threaten the very fabric of
life.
Like you, we have evolved. We've
learned to find better ways to
handle our conflicts.
But no one would deny that a seed
of violence remains in every one
of us. The potential for it is
always there. We must learn to
recognize it... because that
violence is capable of consuming
each of us. Just as it consumed
your son.
