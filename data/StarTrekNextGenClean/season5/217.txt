Captain's log, stardate 45614.6.
We have been contacted by an
androgynous race called the J'naii
to investigate the disappearance
of a shuttlecraft.
We are approaching the designated
coordinates, Captain.
On screen.
Long-range scan, Mister Data.
Sensors find no evidence of the
shuttle anywhere within the star
system.
It couldn't have travelled outside
the system.
Mister Data, reconfigure for a
high-resolution sweep with a
radius of one million kilometers.
Look for possible debris.
Scan shows no debris within
that radius.
I don't understand it. A
shuttle doesn't simply vanish.
There has to be an explanation...
Captain, I am detecting an unusual
reading... It appears to be a
neutrino emission with no visible
source.
Explanation?
I have none. I recommend we
launch a probe.
Make it so.
The probe is launched.
The probe is transmitting
information within normal
parameters. Sensors do not show
evidence of any unusual phenomenon
--
The probe is no longer
transmitting.
What happened? Where did it go?
Captain's log, supplemental. The
sudden disappearance of our probe
suggests that we may have found
the first instance of what is
called null space -- an anomaly
which until now had been only
theoretical. Commander Riker has
been working around the clock with
a team of J'naii specialists to
formalize this hypothesis.
During the creation of a star
system, when clouds of
interstellar dust and gas
coalesce... turbulent regions of
magnetic and gravitational fields
may develop.
If certain conditions occur,
these fields can condense into
abnormal pockets of space.
We think your system contains one
of these null pockets.
If we're right, this pocket would
absorb electromagnetic energy from
anything that entered it...
Like a shuttlecraft.
Or a probe. Making them
powerless.
But outside the pocket, all energy
is bent around it -- making it
naturally cloaked. That's why
we can't see it, and sensors don't
read it.
Is the shuttle still there?
We think so. The ship probably
couldn't sustain its power...
but other than that it wouldn't
be damaged.
Since our shuttles carry
plestorene-based backup systems,
we think life support would
sustain for as long as ten days.
Then perhaps our crew has
survived...
We can send one of our shuttles
into the null space -- but its
energy output would be absorbed
as well. Our chief engineer is
working on a way to maintain the
power reserves long enough to
rescue your crew.
Commander... we're grateful for
your help.
Whatever resources we can provide
are yours.
I've been thinking... when the
time comes, I'd like to pilot the
shuttle.
It's a Starfleet craft...
I can't ask you to put yourself
in danger to rescue our crew.
You can't pilot a shuttle you're
not familiar with.
I happen to be a good pilot...
I happen to be a good pilot, too.
I also know my way around
Starfleet shuttles. So... what
if we team up?
When can we go over your shuttle
flight operations?
Right now.
It's a short-range craft... with
two twelve-hundred fifty
millicochrane warp engines...
Looks like microfusion
thrusters...
Right.
Armament?
Usually none. But it's been
fitted with two type-four phaser
emitters... we'll use them to
chart the null space.
Chart it?
Commander LaForge wants to get
an idea of how big this pocket
is. He thinks the rate of energy
absorption will be linked to its
size.
I'm not sure how we go about
mapping something we can't see...
That's where the emitters come
in. We'll shoot a series of
photon pulses into the pocket and
chart the points where they
disappear. We should be able to
plot a fairly complete outline
that way.
Let's take a look at the controls.
Maybe later we can try a flight
simulation, but first let's do
a systems review.
I'll walk you through it...
Propulsion system... transfer
conduits... where's the schematic
of the reactor assembly? Oh,
there it is... engine nacelles...
There's nothing here that's
unfamiliar.
Navigational deflector...
redundant graviton polarity source
generators...
You're handling those controls
like you grew up in a shuttle...
I did. My parents were pilots.
I started flying with them before
I could walk. And as soon as I
was old enough, I entered flight
school. Krite was my instructor.
He had a good student.
"He?" Commander, there are no
"he's" or "she's" in a species
without gender.
Okay. For two days I've been
trying to construct sentences
without personal pronouns. I give
up... what should I say? "It?"
To us, that's almost rude.
We use a pronoun which is neutral.
But it doesn't really have a
translation.
Then I'll just have to muddle
through... so be tolerant if a
stray "he" or "she" slips by,
okay?
Well, if that's the systems
review, I don't see any problems
here. What's next?
Lunch.
What is it?
Split pea soup. My father's
recipe. I had it programmed into
the replicators.
Well?
Unusual... but I think I like
it...
It's very healthy. Helps keep
you warm on a cold Alaskan night.
We prefer to stay warm by sleeping
with a friend.
I see...
Not to mate... just to sleep
together. For warmth.
Sounds better than pea soup.
We are puzzling to you, aren't
we?
A little. It's hard to grasp the
idea of having no gender...
It's just as hard for us to
understand the strange division
you have in your species... males
and females.
You... are male.
Tell me... about males. What is
it that makes you different from
females?
Snips and snails and puppy dog's
tails...
You have a dog's tail?
That's an old nursery rhyme.
Girls are made of sugar and spice.
Boys are made of snips and
snails...
That makes it sound better to be
female.
It's an old fashioned way of
looking at the sexes. Not to say
that there aren't real
differences. Physically, men tend
to be bigger... stronger in the
upper body. We have different
sexual organs. Men don't bear
young...
What about... feelings? Emotional
attitudes? Are they different?
Well... most people think so.
But that's the kind of question
that might take an hour or two
to answer.
Let me ask you...
What's it like... on a planet where
the people have no gender?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Well... who leads when you dance?
If you dance...
We do... and... whoever's taller
leads.
Without the "battle of the
sexes"... you probably don't
have as many arguments...
Just because we don't have gender
doesn't mean we don't have
conflict. We're very strong-
minded... we love a good fight.
Sounds like there aren't that
many differences between your
species and mine...
Maybe not.
What kind of woman do you find
attractive?
I like a woman who's intelligent
and sure of herself... somebody
I can talk to and get something
back.
But the most important thing of
all -- she has to laugh at my
jokes.
And is that the kind of woman all
human males prefer?
Not at all. Some men like quiet,
demure women... others prefer a
lot of energy... some respond only
to physical attractiveness...
others couldn't care less. There
aren't any rules.
You make it sound very complex.
Believe me -- it is.
Perhaps it is that complexity...
which makes differences in the
sexes... so interesting.
Good evening, Commander.
Good evening.
Please take my place, Krite. I
have to be going.
Thank you for going over the
flight protocols, Commander. It's
been very helpful.
Captain's log, stardate 45616.3.
Commander Riker and the J'naii
pilot have set out on a mission
to chart the null space pocket.
If they are successful, we can
then proceed with a rescue
attempt.
I've illuminated the delta-four
grid map. We can start there and
then expand.
Stand by forward phaser array...
The pulse vanished at delta
four-point-two by point three.
Firing second burst...
Delta four-point-four by point
five.
It's working. I think we'll be
able to give Commander LaForge
the information he needs.
Delta four-point-five by point
seven...
I'm initiating computer task
hand-off...
Commander... tell me about your
sexual organs.
Ahhh...
Is that an uncomfortable subject
for Humans?
No... but it doesn't tend to be
a topic of casual
conversation...
I'm interested in your mating
practices... what is involved
when there are two sexes.
Correcting course... zero-two-one
mark zero...
Mating.
Right. Well, it's pretty simple.
The men inseminate the women and
the women carry the babies.
Our fetuses are incubated in
fibrous husks which both parents
inseminate. From what we know
of other species, our method is
less risky and less painful.
And less enjoyable...
Less enjoyable?
For Humans... the sexual act
brings a closeness... an
intimacy... it's a very
pleasurable experience...
Inseminating a husk...
That's just the last step. Mating
is a long ritual for us... full
of variety and invention... I
assure you -- it's extremely
pleasurable.
I'm picking up a neutrino
emission... from within the null
space.
That may be coming from our
shuttle. I'll note these
coordinates.
I wonder...
What... ?
If a Human and a J'naii would be
sexually compatible...
I don't know...
Of course, it would never be
permitted.
Why not?
The idea of gender... it's
offensive to my people. You see,
long ago we had two sexes, as
you do. But we evolved... into
a higher form.
I don't mean to sound insulting...
but on my planet we've been taught
that gender is...
...primitive.
Primitive.
Less evolved...
Maybe so. But sometimes there's
a lot to be said for an experience
that's... primitive.
Delta-five grid is fully
plotted...
Adjusting course... zero-two-nine
mark zero.
The port engine is down...
Reducing power in the starboard
nacelle...
That's not enough... I have to
activate the maneuvering thrusters
to correct the spin...
Thrusters aren't responding...
I'll try to reroute the firing
sequence...
Inertial dampers are failing...
hang on!
Enterprise to shuttle... do you
read me?
Affirmative... we've lost an
engine...
We'll try to get a tractor beam
on you...
The sooner the better...
Enterprise, we have an injury.
Transport Soren directly to
sickbay.
Right away, Commander.
It's just a mild concussion...
You're going to be fine.
This will reduce the inflammation.
Doctor... you are female.
Yes...
Forgive me... I don't mean to be
rude... but I'm curious. What
is it like?
Well... it's... just the way I
am. I've never thought about what
it's like.
What is it that makes you female?
Very specific biological factors.
Females carry two X chromosomes,
males carry an X and a Y. Hormone
levels are distinctly different;
males produce primarily
testosterone, while women produce
estrogen. Our sexual organs are
very different -- females' are
geared to bearing and nursing the
young.
I've noticed... that you tend to
have longer hair... you arrange
it more elaborately... and you
apply color to your bodies.
Color... ?
You put color on your mouths...
your eyes... your cheeks... even
your fingernails. The men don't.
That's true...
Why do you decorate yourselves
like that?
It's a long-time custom... we're
used to it...
... but I think the real reason
-- is to attract men.
Really?
Mmmm-hmmmm...
Then... it's up to women to
attract the men?
Oh, believe me, men want to be
attractive, too -- but they go
about it differently.
No color...
No color. They'd rather
pretend they're not doing
anything to attract a woman...
even when it's the most important
thing on their minds.
It's very confusing.
Are women considered superior?
Or are men?
Neither. In the past, women were
often considered weak and
inferior. But that hasn't been
true for a long time.
Do you... enjoy being a woman?
Yes. As a matter of fact, I enjoy
it a lot.
Will... your co-pilot is fine.
The injury was minor.
I'm glad to hear it.
I'm afraid you're not rid of me
yet, Commander. I'll be able to
complete the mission.
Then you should hear my new
regulation: no more gymnastics
in the shuttlecraft.
I'm glad you're all right...
What happened... why did the
shuttle go into a spin?
Apparently, the port engine nacelle
nicked one of the protrusions from
the null pocket, and shut down.
Are we still on schedule for the
rescue attempt?
That depends on how you're doing.
I'm fine. We should check out
the port engine --
Whoa... let's get the doctor's
opinion first...
Doctor... ?
I don't see a problem. But if
you have any symptoms... headache,
dizziness -- come back.
You have my word.
All right... this round, the game
is -- Federation Day.
What is that?
The Federation was founded in
Twenty-one-sixty-one. So twos,
sixes, and aces are wild.
That is a woman's game.
Oh? Why is that?
All those wild cards... they
support a weak hand. A man's game
has no wild cards.
Let me get this straight. Are
you saying it's a woman's game
because -- because women are weak
and need more help?
Yes.
And just this afternoon I was
insisting to one of the J'naii
that those attitudes were nothing
but a distant memory.
The J'naii...
They bother me.
Why, Worf?
They just do.
They are all alike. No males.
No females.
I'm sure we're just as strange
to them.
Well, one of them seems to be
overcoming the differences... at
least with regard to one of us...
What are you saying, Doctor?
I could be wrong... but I get the
definite impression that Soren...
is attracted to Commander Riker.
A human and a J'naii?
Impossible.
Why?
Good question. Worf?
With all the wild cards, it is
difficult to know exactly what
is in my hand.
However, I will open with...
fifty.
The port engine nacelle functions
are fully restored... maneuvering
thrusters are operational...
The portable transporter array
is in. Once we get into null
space, we'll have to initialize
it before we transport the J'naii
crew to this shuttle. But there
should still be enough power left
to beam all of us back to the
Enterprise.
Is the buffer field generator
installed?
Not yet. Geordi figures it'll
be ready to go at oh-eight-hundred
hours tomorrow.
We should adjust the engine
balance before that. Can you
access the starboard thrust
manifold?
There...
Okay, calibrate it to arc at
six-point-three while I optimize
the plasma flow.
Commander...
Mmmmm?
I'd like... to tell you something.
Something that's not easy to say.
What's that?
I... find you attractive.
I'm taking a terrible risk,
telling you that. It means...
revealing something to you...
Something that, if it were known
on my planet, would be very
dangerous for me.
Occasionally, among my people,
a few are born who are --
different. Who are throwbacks
to the era when we all had gender.
Some are born with strong
inclinations toward maleness...
and some have urges to be female.
I am one of the latter.
I have to admit... I got the
feeling you were different.
I was hoping you would. But in
front of Krite and the others,
I must be careful not to reveal
myself.
Why?
On our world these feelings are
forbidden. Those who are
discovered are shamed and
ridiculed. Only by undergoing
psychotectic therapy and having
all elements of gender eliminated
can they become accepted into
society again.
Those of us who have these
urges... live secret, guarded
lives.
We seek each other out... always
hiding, always terrified of being
discovered...
How long have you known you were
like this?
I've known I was different all
my life. But I didn't understand
how or why until I was older.
And when you realized... what
then?
I remember when I was very
young... before I understood what
I was... there was a rumor in
my school that one of the students
preferred a gender... in that
case, male. The children started
making fun of him... every day,
they got more cruel... They could
tell he was afraid... and that
seemed to encourage them.
He appeared in class one morning,
bleeding... his clothes ripped.
He said he'd fallen down.
Of course the school authorities
heard about it... They took him
away and gave him psychotectic
treatments.
When he came back... he stood in
front of the whole school and told
us how happy he was now that he
had been cured.
After that... I knew how dangerous
it was to be different. And as
I got older, and realized what
I was, I was terrified.
I've lived with that fear ever
since.
Do you have... relationships...
with others?
Yes -- with those who have
discovered they are male.
I've had to live a life of
pretense and lies. With you...
I can be honest.
Don't say anything. Just... think
about it.
Okay, Commander, everything checks
out. The energy buffer is
installed and functioning. I
estimate it should reduce the
power drain to your systems by
about forty percent.
Any guess how long we'll have?
Let just say... you don't want
to waste any time once you get
in there.
You'll have to give him continuous
readouts on energy consumption.
I can't even predict if the drain
will be at a constant rate.
I understand.
Then... that's it.
I'll monitor you as far as I can,
Commander. But once you get into
that pocket -- you're on your own.
Since we don't know the condition
of the shuttle crew, I'll beam
us all directly to sickbay.
I'll notify Doctor Crusher to be
standing by.
LaForge to bridge...
Picard here...
We're ready to initiate shuttle
prelaunch sequence.
Proceed, Mister Data.
Prelaunch sequence is underway.
Request flight clearance.
Clearance is granted.
The shuttle is underway.
Good hunting, Commander.
Thank you, sir. See you for
dinner.
Heading three-five-five mark
zero-one-two.
Heading confirmed.
Energy readings are normal, with
power reserves stabilized at one
hundred percent.
Acknowledged.
It's dead ahead, approximately
fifty kilometers.
Riker to Enterprise. We're going
in.
Riker to Enterprise...
Riker to Enterprise...
Power reserves are down to
eighty-four percent.
Look...
Try hailing them...
Calling the "Taris Murn... " Do
you read me?
I'm getting sensor readings.
They're unconscious -- but they're
alive.
Stand by. I'm going to transport
them over here.
Power reserves at sixty-eight
percent and dropping.
The null space must be affecting
the annular confinement beam...
We used ten megajoules with that
attempt. We're down to
thirty-four percent of reserves.
We can give it one more try. More
than that and we won't have enough
power to get ourselves out of
here.
They need medical attention
quickly.
Okay. Stand by to transport to
the Enterprise.
Here we go...
Energy consumption?
We're down to nine percent. Will,
we don't have enough to get back.
If we just sit here, we'll lose
all our systems within an hour
-- including life support.
I'm rerouting the propulsion
system to the transporter...
Rechannel the navigation
systems...
Let's transfer every microjoule
of energy we've got... sensors...
life support... this might give
us one last shot.
An energy shift of that size...
it'll overload the phase
compensators... the shuttle --
Will explode. But if we stay here
we're dead, anyway.
Maximum energy levels in five
seconds...
See you in a minute.
Doctor... ?
They've been oxygen-deprived...
but I don't think there's any
significant damage.
Prepare some dexalin.
Commander -- thank you.
Your colleague Soren was a great
help.
Captain... if you would all join
us this evening... we would like
to express our gratitude...
We'd be happy to.
Noor will be eager to get a
first-hand report. We should
return to the surface.
I will see you tonight then,
Commander?
There you are, Commander. I
wondered what had happened to our
guest of honor.
Just getting some fresh air.
I can take so much of these social
functions... then I need to
breathe a little.
I would think you had attended
so many affairs like this it would
be second nature to you.
I was raised in the outdoors.
I'm never that comfortable in
crowded rooms...
What do you think of our planet?
Isn't it beautiful?
Yes. Quite beautiful.
We have many varieties of plant
life...
Perhaps you would like to inspect
some of them.
Yes, I would. I've always been
interested in exobotany.
Please. Let me take you on a
tour.
Thank you. It's very kind of you.
One of my favorites is this
menellen tree. The leaves first
turn pure white, and then blue
when the weather gets cold...
This is called a falla bush...
it produces a fragrant flower on
only one day of the year...
Captain's log, stardate 45620.4.
We remain in orbit of J'naii,
charting the null pocket. We hope
that a detailed map of the anomaly
will prevent the loss of other
ships.
Come in.
Hello, Will.
What's all this?
Wonderful things... my mother sent
me a box that belonged to one of
my father's ancestors. It had
been stored on Earth years ago
and just recently turned up.
Do you know who these people are?
No. A few of the pictures are
marked with names... but most of
them aren't. I look at all these
faces... and wonder who they
are... if they might be related
to me...
This one looks like you...
Deanna... I've got something on my
mind... and I had to see you...
Has something happened?
I've met someone... someone who's
becoming important to me...
Soren...
Yes.
You're my friend... so it seemed
like...
I'm not sure. It just seemed
right to tell you.
I'm glad you did.
Nothing will change between us,
will it?
Of course it will. All
relationships are constantly
changing.
But we will always be friends.
Maybe even better friends.
You're part of my life, and I'm
part of yours. That much will
always be true.
Turns out the null pocket is even
more irregular than we expected,
Commander.
Maybe its configuration is
shifting.
I don't think so... the
measurements you took are holding.
It just has more projections than
we thought. It's going to take
longer than we planned to get it
mapped.
I'm headed for the shuttle bay.
We're fitting another shuttle to
help in the survey.
Have you made plans for dinner
this evening?
I have some paperwork to do...
I thought I'd start on it...
I'd like to discuss some of our
suggestions for regulating travel
around the null space. Maybe we
could have an early dinner... so
you could still get your work done
afterwards.
I'd like that.
Nineteen hundred hours?
That would be fine.
Hello. I'm here to see Soren...
I know.
We had an appointment.
To discuss plans for regulating
the --
I don't think so, Commander.
Excuse me?
We know about the two of you.
We know what you're doing.
Where's Soren?
And we're going to make sure it
doesn't happen again.
Answer me -- where is Soren?
Gone. In custody. And there's
nothing you can do about it.
The hell there isn't.
You are aware of the charges
against you?
Yes.
Do you intend to dispute them?
Well? What is your response?
Are you in charge here?
Commander Riker -- these
proceedings are closed to anyone
but --
I think I just opened them.
Sir, this is a private matter.
We are grateful for your recent
help, but that gives you no right
to interfere with our personal
concerns --
I want you to know what really
happened. It's all my fault.
I was attracted to Soren. I
pursued... I insisted. I didn't
understand your ways until Soren
told me. And rejected me.
Nothing happened between us.
I ask your forgiveness. I
behaved... inappropriately.
Is this true?
No.
Soren --
I am tired of lies.
I am female. I was born that way.
I have had those feelings...
those longings... all my life.
It is not unnatural. I am not
sick because I feel this way.
I do not need to be helped, and
I do not need to be cured. What
I do need -- what all of those
like me need -- is your
understanding and your compassion.
We do not injure you in any way.
And yet we are scorned, and
attacked. And all because we are
different.
What we do is no different from
what you do. We talk and laugh...
we complain about work and we
wonder about growing old... we
talk about our families, and we
worry about the future...
We cry with each other when things
seem hopeless.
All the loving things that you
do with each other... that's what
we do. And for that, we are
called misfits, and deviants...
and criminals.
What right do you have to punish
us? What right do you have to
change us? What makes you think
you can dictate how people love
each other?
I congratulate you, Soren. Your
decision to admit your perversion
makes it much more likely that
we can help you.
No, wait... you don't have to do
this...
Commander?
Let me take her away. She can
come with me, we'll give her
asylum on the Enterprise. You'll
never have to see her again.
That would solve the problem,
wouldn't it? You'd be rid of
her... she couldn't influence
anyone else...
Commander, after Soren's diatribe,
you must think we are a cruel,
repressive people. Nothing could
be further from the truth.
I'm just trying to find a solution
that would satisfy everyone --
In fact, we are a remarkably free
and open society. Our people have
rights and liberties which give
them a great deal of
self-determination. We are, by
all measurements, an enlightened
race.
Then how is it... that Soren has
no choice about her sexual
orientation?
We are concerned about our
citizens. We take our obligations
to them seriously. Soren is
sick... and sick people need to
get well.
Did it ever occur to you she
might prefer to stay the way she
is?
You don't understand. We have
a very high success rate in
treating deviants like this. And
without exception -- they have
become happier people after their
treatment. And grateful... that
we care enough to cure them.
You see, Commander... on this
world, everyone wants to be
normal.
She is --
Take her to quarters. Treatment
will begin tomorrow.
Don't do this --
Soren --
No more, Commander.
Enterprise. One to transport.
I can't just leave her there.
They'll give her these
psychotectic treatments...
I don't know what to do.
I could talk to Noor. Perhaps
there's a way to work this out
--
Sir, their minds are set. They
don't want to hear another
solution.
Then I'm not sure there's much
we can do.
There has to be.
My relationship with Soren isn't
trivial... she's very important
to me.
It's my fault this has happened.
And I have to help her.
Will, if you've come here for
sanction... to take matters into
your own hands... I can't give
it to you.
I know that, sir. But I know
I have to do something.
Interfering in the internal
matters of the J'naii is
prohibited by the Prime
Directive...
I'm aware of that.
If you violate it, you may be
putting your career in jeopardy.
Starfleet doesn't take these
matters lightly... and I can't
defend you if you go too far...
Do you understand that?
You've made yourself very clear,
sir.
Will... don't risk everything
you've worked for...
Thank you, sir. May I be excused
now?
Who is it?
Lieutenant Worf.
Come in.
Commander, I have the plan for
deploying warning buoys around
the null space.
Fine. Just leave it, I'll look
at it later.
Yes, sir.
Thank you. You're dismissed.
Commander... I am aware of what
transpired on the planet's
surface...
Are you by any chance considering
an... unannounced visit?
I will go with you.
Lieutenant --
Sir... you are my commanding
officer... and if you order me
to stay on board, I will obey.
But I ask you not to give that
order. A warrior does not let
a friend face danger alone.
I suggest we change clothing
first.
The meeting is ending. I
think they will bring her out of
the building soon.
Okay. They'll probably come
down that path... we can take
cover there --
-- behind those rocks.
Yes, Commander.
She'll be under guard... no
telling how many...
I will handle the guards. You
take her to cover.
Something's happening...
They're leaving.
Could you excuse us? I have to
talk to her...
Wait...
Don't worry... we'll be out of
here in a minute...
Will, please...
We're almost there...
You can't do this...
I won't let them hurt you. You'll
be safe on the Enterprise.
Soren...
I'm so sorry... it's my fault you
got involved in all this...
It's going to be all right...
everything's going to be fine...
No, it's not.
What are you talking about?
It was all a mistake. I should
have realized it from the
beginning...
What... ?
That I was sick. I had these
terrible urges... that's why I
reached out to you... but it was
wrong. I see that now.
I don't understand how I could
have done... what I did.
Maybe... maybe Doctor Crusher
could treat you... bring you
back... to the way you were
before.
Why would I want that?
Soren... I love you.
I'm sorry.
How long to the Phelan system?
At warp six, fifty-three hours,
sir.
Commander... ?
Captain.
Starfleet has just sent a message
asking us to proceed to the Phelan
system to negotiate a trade
agreement.
Yes, sir.
I wasn't sure when to tell them
we'd be underway.
Is our business with the J'naii
finished?
Finished, sir.
Very well. Ensign, take us out
of orbit, set a course for the
Phelan system. Warp six.
Engage.
