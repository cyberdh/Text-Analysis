Captain's log, stardate 45854.2.
The Enterprise is charting six
star systems that make up the
Argolis cluster, an area being
considered for colonization.
Very impressive...
It's beautiful... and frightening
at the same time.
Radiation bursts from the star's
surface are making precise sensor
readings difficult. It seems to
be exhibiting gravitational
instability.
The star's fluctuations are too
severe. It would be impossible
to settle any of the planets
in this system.
I suggest we proceed to the next
system. Its sun is a stable main
sequence star.
In a moment, Mister Data.
Sir, I am detecting a
transmission... emanating from
within this system
What kind of signal?
It is self-repeating... of unknown
pattern.
Where is it coming from?
A small moon orbiting the fourth
planet.
Life signs?
Indeterminate. I am attempting
to screen out sensor
interference...
Readings are still inconclusive;
however, the moon's atmosphere is
capable of supporting life.
Then it could be a distress call.
Helm, take us into transport
range.
Doctor Crusher, we need a medical
away team in transporter room two.
Acknowledged.
I'm reading one life form... very
weak signs.
Riker to Enterprise.
Go ahead, Number One.
We've found the wreckage of a
small craft... and one survivor.
It's a Borg.
Male, adolescent -- he's badly
hurt.
There is no indication of other
Borg activity within sensor range.
Away team, prepare to return to
the ship.
We can't leave him here, he won't
survive.
I think the captain understands
that.
Then I don't.
The Borg usually collect their
dead --
He's not dead --
And that transmission --
-- at least not yet --
That transmission we intercepted
was probably a homing signal.
We have to assume they're on their
way.
At least let me stabilize his
condition, give him a chance of
surviving until they get here.
Captain?
Your concern is noted, Doctor.
But any intervention on your part
would only alert the Borg to our
having been here.
I'm afraid we've already turned
that corner.
Kill it. Now. We could make it
appear that it died in the crash
-- leave no evidence that we were
here.
Security measures must be taken
before we beam it on board.
Standing by...
Mister Data, notify security to
prepare a detention cell.
Bridge to engineering.
LaForge here.
We're bringing a Borg survivor
on board. We'll need to
neutralize the homing signal --
-- prevent it from sending or
receiving transmissions of any
kind.
I'll set up a subspace damping
field around the detention cell.
There are four others. None
survived.
Picard to Riker.
Go ahead, Enterprise.
We're transporting you directly
to the detention cell.
I need him in sickbay --
The cell, Doctor. Whatever
equipment you need will be brought
to you there.
Very well.
Come.
Captain... I just wondered if
there's anything you wanted to
talk about.
I don't think so, Counselor.
I would have thought that
having a Borg on the ship would
stir some feelings...
I am quite recovered from my
experience, thank you.
Sometimes... even when a victim
has dealt with his assault...
there are residual effects of the
event that linger. You were
treated violently by the Borg...
kidnapped, assaulted, mutilated
--
Counselor --
Counselor, I very much appreciate
your concern for me. But I assure
you, it is misplaced.
I have carefully considered the
implications of having this Borg
on the ship. I have weighed the
possible risks, and I am convinced
we've done the right thing.
I am quite comfortable with my
decision.
I see. Well, if at any point you
want to talk more...
I will certainly avail myself of
your help.
Lower the force field.
Captain, the Borg is still
unconscious.
He suffered massive internal
injuries. We've got the
hemorrhaging under control, but
some of the implants in his brain
were damaged. I may have to
remove them.
The Borg will die if they're
removed permanently. Their brains
grow dependent on the biochips.
Perhaps Geordi could construct
new implants...
They contain relatively
straightforward programming,
interface protocols... we have
the files we downloaded after your
experience, sir. I think I could
manage it.
Mister LaForge... do you have
enought knowledge of Borg
programming to alter the pathways
to the root command structure?
I'm not sure, sir. The
subroutines are pretty
complicated... I'd probably have
to study their data processing
algorithms... that's the only way
I could trace the access codes.
If we could get to the root
command... we could introduce an
invasive programming sequence
through its biochip system...
and then return it to the hive.
The Borg are so interconnected
it would spread like a virus.
Until it infected the entire
Collective. We could disable
their neural network in one
stroke.
Infected... it sounds like you're
talking about a disease.
Quite right, Doctor. And if all
goes well, a terminal one.
If this works the way I think it
will, once the invasive program
starts spreading, it'll only be
a matter of months before the Borg
suffer total systems failure.
Comments.
A question. What, exactly, is
"total systems failure?"
The Borg are extremely
computer-dependent. A total
systems failure will destroy
them.
I just think we should be plain
about that. We're talking about
annihilating an entire race...
Which under most circumstances
would be unconscionable. But as
I see it, the Borg leave us little
choice.
I agree. We're at war.
There's been no formal declaration
of war...
Not from our side. But certainly
from theirs. They've attacked
us in every encounter we've had.
They have declared war on our way
of life. We are to be
assimilated.
Even in war, there are rules.
You don't kill civilians
indiscriminately.
There are no civilians among the
Borg.
Think of them as a single,
collective being. Any one Borg
is no more an individual than your
arm or your leg.
How convenient.
Your point?
When I look at my patient, I don't
see a collective consciousness...
I don't see a hive... I see a
living, breathing boy... who's
been hurt and who needs help.
And we're talking about sending
him back to his people as an
instrument of destruction.
It comes down to this: We are
faced with an enemy that is
determined to destroy us, and with
whom we have no hope of
negotiating peace. Unless that
changes, we are justified in doing
anything we can to survive.
Security to Captain.
Picard, here.
The Borg has regained
consciousness, sir.
Acknowledged.
We will proceed as planned.
What's he doing?
Trying to find an access terminal,
so he can interface with the
collective. He doesn't understand
that the signal has been cut off.
He's emitting a homing signal...
and a second subspace frequency...
but our damping field is blocking
both signals.
He's alone. For the first time
in his life he's being forced to
cope with his environment without
the resources of the Collective.
He must be hungry.
The Borg don't ingest food --
their implants can synthesize any
organic molecules their biological
tissues require. What they need
-- is energy.
Arrange to feed it.
Aye, sir.
I'll have to adapt a power conduit
and install it in there.
If I didn't know better... I'd
think he was scared.
I don't think I like this sport.
Last week when you scored two
touches on me, you liked it well
enough.
Today your foil was dipping too
low... you kept letting me inside.
And if I hold it too high, you
lunge under it. Let's face it
-- you're just better at this than
I am.
I hear we have a guest on board.
Yes.
Is that wise?
I'm not sure. I hope so.
I thought I understood you,
Picard. But I don't understand
this.
It was an errand of mercy... he
was injured, Doctor Crusher
decided for humanitarian reasons
to care for him --
They'll be coming, you know that.
You, of all people, know that.
Shall we go again?
You felt sorry for me. Look what
it got you.
I'll have to go in... to connect
the power conduit.
I will follow the Commander.
Reactivate the field once we're
through.
Good, now just stay there.
Commander...
We are Borg.
You will be assimilated.
Resistance is futile.
Take a look around, pal, you're
not exactly in a position to make
demands.
We must return to the Collective.
Who's "we?"
We... are Borg.
There's only one of you.
Do you have a name?
A means of identification?
Third, of five.
There were five on your ship...
Is that it? Just a number?
Third, of five.
It does kind of suit you.
This is for you. It regulates
the power flow to the frequency
you're used to...
... and this connection should fit
the coupling on your arm.
You're welcome.
Let's get out of here.
Lower the force field.
He's hungry all right.
Why do you do this?
I'm just a nice guy at heart.
Feeling better?
You are not-Borg.
That's right. And hope to stay
that way.
You will be assimilated.
Resistance is futile.
That's gratitude for you.
I've been rationing his portions
of energy. I think he
understands -- if he cooperates,
he gets fed. If not...
Like a rat in a cage.
If I'm gonna figure out his
command pathways, I have to learn
how he processes information.
The only way I know to do that
is to give him perceptual tests.
That means getting his
cooperation.
So he can participate in the
destruction of his entire species.
Doctor...
I know, I know. We're at war.
I'm here to help you... but I
don't have to like it.
I think we're ready to transport
him. If he gives us any trouble,
we can access the force field
through this console.
Ready?
LaForge to transporter room three.
We're ready here.
We are standing by, Commander.
Energize.
You want some?
Doctor Crusher, this is Third of
Five. Third of Five, this is our
ship's doctor.
Hello.
What is a doctor?
A doctor heals the sick. Repairs
the injured.
The sick and injured are
reabsorbed. Others take their
place.
That didn't happen to you. When
we found you, you were dying.
I saved your life.
Why?
That's my duty. To help those
who are hurt.
You give us food...
Right.
Is that your duty?
Yeah. That's right.
Listen, Third of Five... Doctor
Crusher here has repaired a lot
of the damage to your biochip
implants. We want to run a few
tests... see if everything is
working okay.
Tests...
I'll show you some diagrams...
ask you some questions about
them... it's very simple, really.
You will be assimilated...
Right. But before that happens,
could we maybe ask you a few
questions?
We will answer.
Terrific. Okay, Third of Five,
right over here...
What is your designation?
Designation?
Third, of Five...
You mean our names. We don't have
designations -- we have names.
I'm Beverly...
This is Geordi.
Do I have a -- name?
Do you want one?
A name...
I'm Beverly, this is Geordi...
... and you...
You...
You...
That's it. Hugh. What do you
think?
You.
Not you... Hugh.
Hugh.
All right... I'm Beverly...
I'm Geordi...
We are Hugh.
Now imagine what this shape would
look like if it were turned inside
out.
Which one is it?
This one.
That's right.
He's gotten every one -- eight
for eight. That blows the top
right off the spatial acuity
percentiles.
It's the prosthetic eye... it
seems to be giving him very
complex visual information...
Like some kind of holographic
imaging system.
That could be helpful.
Hugh, I'd like to take a closer
look at your eyepiece. Is that
okay?
Here.
Well... thanks.
When you are assimilated, you will
have a similar device.
Hugh, do you understand that we
don't want to be assimilated?
Why do you resist us?
Because... we don't want to live
the way you do.
Here it is quiet. There are no
other voices.
Other voices?
On a Borg ship we live with the
thoughts of the others in our
minds. Thousands of voices...
with us always.
I think what you're saying... is
that you're lonely.
Here you go.
When you have completed these
tests, what will be done with us?
We'll send you home.
We will rejoin the Collective.
It's funny... when I first started
out, I had no problem with
creating this invasive program...
but the more I work with Hugh,
the more I --
Hugh?
That's the name we gave him.
You named a Borg...
Yeah.
It was easier to have something
to call him.
Okay, so now you have a Borg named
Hugh...
And... he's not anything like I'd
expected.
How so?
I don't know... he's... he just
seems like a kid.. a long way from
home...
You're the second person today
that's talked about this Borg as
if he were a lost child...
And now I'm having second thoughts
about what we're doing.
Programming him like a walking
bomb... sending him back to
destroy the others...
This "kid's" big brothers are
going to hunt us down. They won't
rest until they have him back.
And they'll destroy us in the
process -- without any of this
soul-searching you're going
through.
Maybe you should go talk to him.
It might not seem so clear cut
then.
I wouldn't have anything to say.
Then why don't you just listen?
That's what you do best, isn't
it?
What is it, Number One?
We've picked up a vessel on long
range scanners, headed this way.
Analysis.
The vessel is traveling at warp
seven-point-six. Mass:
two-point-five million metric
tons, configuration: ...cubical.
The Borg...
Its dimensions indicate that it
is a scout ship similar to the
one that crashed.
Interference from the star's
radiation will shield us from
their sensors. We should remain
undetected until they enter this
system.
How long do we have?
At present speed they will arrive
in thirty-one hours, seven
minutes.
Well... you don't look so tough.
We are Borg.
I hear they gave you a name.
Yes. We are Hugh.
Well? Aren't you going to tell
me I have to be assimilated?
You wish to be assimilated... ?
No, I don't wish. But that's what
you people do.
Resistance is futile. Right?
Resistance is futile...
I've got news for you. It isn't.
Some of my ancestors resisted the
Borg, when you came to assimilate
us. A few escaped.
Resistance is not futile...
No...
But thanks to you, there aren't
many of us. We're scattered
around the galaxy... we have no
home... we don't even have each
other.
What you are saying... is that
you are lonely.
What... ?
You have no others. You have no
home.
We are also lonely.
What is Geordi doing?
Just studying the components in
your prosthesis.
Why?
We're just trying to learn more
about you.
Why?
You're very different from us.
Part of what we do is to learn
more about other species.
We assimilate species. Then we
know everything about them.
Yeah. I know.
Is that not easier?
Maybe it is. It's just not what
we do.
Why?
Think about it this way. Every
time you talk about yourself, you
use the word "we." We do this,
we do that... you don't know how
to think of yourself as a single
individual. You don't say, "I
want this," or "I am Hugh."
We are all separate individuals.
I am Geordi. I choose what I want
to do with my life. I make
decisions for myself. For people
like me, losing that individuality
-- is almost worse than dying.
When you sleep... there are no
voices in your mind.
No.
Are you ever...
... lonely?
Sometimes. But that's why we have
friends.
Friends...
Sure. Someone you talk to...
who can be with you when you're
lonely... who makes you feel
better.
Like Geordi... and Hugh.
That's it, Captain.
It looks harmless enough.
We had to disguise it as something
innocuous. The Borg have ways
of screening out programming
anomalies.
How can a geometric form
disable a computer system?
The shape is a paradox. It cannot
exist in real space or time.
When Hugh's imaging apparatus
imprints it on his bio-chips,
he'll try to analyze it.
He will be unsuccessful, and will
store the shape in his memory
banks. It will be shunted to a
subroutine for further analysis.
When the Borg download his memory,
they'll incorporate it into their
network. Then they'll try to
analyze it.
It is designed so that each
approach they take will spawn an
anomalous solution. The anomalies
are designed to interact with each
other, linking together to form
an endless and unsolvable puzzle.
Quite original. How long before
total systems failure?
Not until the shape has gone
through several hundred
computational cycles.
When can you begin the process?
Another twenty hours. Doctor
Crusher wants to make sure the
new implants have taken hold.
Very well. Proceed as soon as
you're ready.
Captain...
I have to admit... I've been
having second thoughts about this
plan.
For what reason?
Well... I've been getting to know
him. The Borg.
I see.
He's not what I thought he would
be, sir. He has feelings... he's
homesick...
I don't know... it just seems
wrong to use him like this.
Centuries ago, when laboratory
animals were used for research...
scientists would occasionally
become attached to the creatures.
That was a problem if the
experiment involved killing them.
I would suggest you unattach
yourself from the Borg, Mister
LaForge.
Aye, Captain.
Come.
Guinan... please, come in.
You sure? Looks like you're all
set for a quiet evening.
I'm delighted to see you. Would
you like something to drink?
No, thanks.
I was thinking about how you said
my foil was dipping the other
day... maybe I should do some
exercises... build up a little
strength in my arm...
A strong forearm is always an
advantage in fencing...
Not to mention tending bar...
About the Borg...
Aren't you just a bit surprised
by him?
Surprised...
Yes. Did you know he has a name?
LaForge gave it to him. His
name's Hugh. And he's lonely.
I don't know what made me go see
him. LaForge told me I should,
but I said no.
And then... I found myself
standing there, staring at him.
Curiosity, I figured... just
curiosity.
Picard... I want to hear you say
that you're sure -- that what
you're doing is right.
If you've come here to persuade
me not to use the invasive
program...
No -- I think I'm asking you to
persuade me.
Two days ago, you were so upset
about the Borg even being on the
ship that you tore the foil out
of my hand. Now you're here
questioning whether he should be
treated as an enemy.
I know. But... when you talk to
him... face to face... can you
honestly say you have no doubts?
I haven't talked to him.
Why not?
I see no need --
If you're going to use this person
--
It's a Borg, damn it, not a
person --!
If you're going to use this person
to destroy his race, don't you
think you should look him in the
eye once before you do it?
Besides... I'm not so sure he is
Borg anymore.
Because he's been given a name
by a member of the crew doesn't
mean he's no longer Borg. Because
he's young doesn't mean he's
innocent. He is what he is and
in spite of the efforts to turn
him into some kind of pet -- I
will not alter our plans.
Fine. But unless you talk to him
-- at least once -- you might find
that decision harder to live with
than you realize.
Worf to Captain Picard...
Yes, Lieutenant.
We are ready to transport.
Proceed.
You may wait outside, Lieutenant.
Locutus...
Yes. I am Locutus... of Borg.
Why are you here?
This is a primitive culture. I
am here to facilitate its
incorporation. Identify yourself.
Hugh.
Identify yourself.
We are Hugh.
This is not a Borg identification.
Third... of five.
This culture will be assimilated.
They... do not wish it.
Irrelevant.
They will resist us.
Resistance is futile.
Resistance... is not futile.
Some have escaped.
They will be found. It is
inevitable. All will be
assimilated.
Must... Geordi be assimilated?
Yes.
Geordi does not wish it.
He would rather die than be
assimilated.
Then he will die.
No. Geordi must not die.
Geordi is... a friend.
You will assist us in assimilating
this vessel.
You are Borg. You will assist
us.
I will not.
What did you say?
I will not assist you.
"I"... ?
Geordi must not be assimilated.
But... you are Borg.
No. I am -- Hugh.
... I think I deliberately avoided
speaking with the Borg because
I didn't want anything to get in
the way of our plan.
But now something has. As far
as I can tell, he seems to be a
fully realized individual. He
has even accepted me as Picard,
Captain of this ship, and not as
Locutus.
Then... you've reconsidered the
plan?
Yes. If we used him in that
manner, we'd be no better than
the enemy we seek to destroy.
I want other options.
We could return him to the crash
site... but we'd have to erase
his memories of being on the
Enterprise.
But... if we erase his memories,
then who he is, who he's become,
would be destroyed.
Isn't that the point? He'd be
reassimilated into the hive
without any questions...
It just seems wrong... we help
turn him into an individual...
then we take that away from him...
Is there a danger that the Borg
might destroy him -- if they
discover what's happened?
I doubt it. They have nothing
to gain by that. It's more likely
they'll simply wipe out his memory
of this experience.
Then either way his memories will
be erased.
But perhaps...
... in the short time before they
purge those memories... the sense
of individuality which he has
gained here will be transmitted
throughout the Collective.
Every one of the Borg will have
the opportunity to experience the
feeling of... singularity.
Perhaps that would be the most
pernicious program of all... the
knowledge of self, spread through
the Borg Collective in that brief
moment, might alter them forever.
We will leave his memories intact.
I have only one question.
What if he doesn't want to go
back?
Hello, Hugh.
Hello, Geordi.
Hugh... a Borg rescue vessel is
approaching. It will be here
within three hours. We can return
you to the crash site, where they
will find you and take you home.
Or... if you wish, you may remain
here with us.
What I wish... is irrelevant.
It's not irrelevant. It matters
to us.
No Borg leaves the Collective.
If they find I am missing -- they
will come for me.
Hugh, we'll deal with the
repercussions later. What we must
know is what you want.
You are many. I am one. My needs
are not important.
Don't you understand? We're
giving you a choice.
Choice...
Yeah. Do you want to go back with
the Borg... or stay with us?
I could stay with you... ?
Yes. We would grant you asylum.
Choose... what I want...
I would choose to stay with
Geordi.
But it is too dangerous. They
will follow.
Return me to the crash site. It
is the only way.
Hugh... think about this... are
you sure?
Yes.
The Borg ship will enter orbit of
the moon within an hour. You'll
soon be headed home.
We'll beam him down and take
position in the star's
chromosphere. Its interference
will hide us from their sensors.
Goodbye, Hugh. I'm very glad I
got to know you.
Goodbye, Beverly.
You saved my life.
It's not too late to change your
mind. You can stay here.
I must return.
Captain, I'd like to go down with
him.
My experience suggests that they
would ignore him.
Would you agree?
The Borg assimilate civilizations.
Not individuals.
But, Captain, they kidnapped
you...
Because they needed a liaison to
communicate with Humans. The
Borg ignored every away team we
sent to their ship, including
yours, Doctor.
You may accompany him.
Goodbye.
Captain... I do not want to forget
that I am Hugh...
Energize.
We found you there... in the
middle of that debris.
Then that is where I will wait.
We are now entering position.
Radiation levels are rising.
Increase power to the shields.
Hold us here.
Status of the Borg ship?
Solar radiation is rendering our
sensors inoperable. At last known
course and speed, the Borg vessel
will enter the system in three
minutes.
Well... I guess this is it.
So long, Hugh.
Goodbye, Geordi. I will try to
remember you.
