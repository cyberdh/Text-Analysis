Captain's log, stardate 45944.1.
We're en route to Starbase
Two-eighteen after a magnetic wave
survey of the Parvenium Sector.
We will give our report directly
to Fleet Admiral Gustafson.
The last time I encountered
Admiral Gustafson... I ended up
spending nine straight hours at
the opera.
Nine hours... ?
The entire "Ring" cycle at one
sitting...
That's a little too much Wagner
for me.
And for me... but not, apparently,
for Admiral Gustafson. She went
back the next day and sat through
it all again. I warned her that
this time --
Sir, sensors detect an
unidentified object... twenty-two
thousand kilometers off the port
quarter.
On screen.
Magnify.
Mister Data?
It appears to be a probe of some
kind... but there is no Starfleet
record of this shape or design.
Is it scanning us?
No sir... but it has assumed a
relative position and is holding
course with us.
The probe is composed of...
paricium and talgonite... a
ceramic alloy.
Not a very sophisticated
technology...
Sir, I'm detecting a low-level
nucleonic beam coming from the
probe.
Shields up; stand by phasers.
The beam is scanning the shield's
perimeter.
The probe is emitting an unusual
particle stream --
Captain, the beam is penetrating
our shields --
Increase power to --
Captain?...
Captain, I've got you; it's
all...
Well.. finally.
How are you feeling?
Kamin... can you answer me?
Where is this... ?
You're still feverish...
Computer, freeze program.
End program.
Picard to Enterprise --
Kamin, please don't try to get
up yet... you're still not well.
I asked you... what is this place?
This... is your home, of course.
Where is my uniform? My
communicator?
I'd better call the doctor
again...
I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
the Federation Starship
Enterprise. I would like to speak
with whoever is in charge here.
If you'll just lie down, I'll brew
you some nice warm kenomay...
Just tell me this -- am I a
prisoner here?
Please, dear... you've had a high
fever for three days... you
mustn't push yourself too
quickly...
You shouldn't go outside...
Kamin... please come back
inside...
This sapling is planted as an
affirmation of life... in defiance
of the drought and with
expectations of long life.
Whatever comes -- we will keep
it alive, as a symbol of our
survival.
Kamin! You're back on your feet!
How do you feel, my friend?
Are you in charge here?
In charge... ?
I want to be returned to my ship
immediately.
What... ship is that?
Please... if you could tell me...
what is this place? Where am I?
The fever... it's taken your
memory.
That must be it. Perhaps you
could help me...
Anything, my friend.
My name is Kamin... and you are
-- ?
Batai...
Council leader.
Ah. And you say I've been ill...
For over a week. Eline should've
put you in the hospital, but she
insisted on caring for you
herself.
Eline.
Your wife. If you don't remember
that, maybe it's safer not to go
home.
And... what is this place?
Perhaps you should see the
doctor...
Please -- I'm sure it will come
back to me...
This... is the community of
Ressik. Northern province.
What planet?
Come... let me take you back home.
I'm really quite all right. If
you'll just answer...
This is the planet Kataan.
Kataan... not a Federation
planet.
I think I'll take a walk...
You've been ill for a week...
Exercise will do me good. I'd
like to -- re-acquaint myself with
the surroundings.
Thank goodness...
I've had people out trying to find
you everywhere. Why did you
worry us like that?
Are you hungry?
Hungry, thirsty... weary... I
suppose that proves this isn't
a dream, doesn't it?
You think this... your life...
is a dream?
It's not my life... I know that
much.
I've kept something hot for you.
Where did you go?
I walked. For hours.
And you just out of bed...
This is delicious...
You always say that...
Would you -- answer some questions
for me? No matter how strange
they might seem to you?
Of course...
Are there other planets in this
star system? Do you visit any
other systems... ?
All right. Is there any kind of
communication system here? How
do you send messages to... to
other communities? Other places?
The usual way... by
voice-transit conductors. Do
you want to send a message?
Yes. When can that be arranged?
Tomorrow.
Don't you want to ask about...
us?
Of course. Anything you can tell
me would be helpful. We are...
married?
Three years ago... the happiest
day of my life was the day we got
married.
You're probably tired of hearing
it... but I've loved you since
I was seven years old. That's
when I decided I was going to be
your wife, and no one was going
to change my mind.
I'm glad I was so stubborn...
What is it that I do... here in
Ressik?
You're the best iron weaver in
the community. At least I think
so. You prefer playing the flute,
of course.
The flute?
And when did I learn to play it?
I'm afraid you've never learned,
dear. You do keep trying.
I see what you mean.
Thank you for the soup. And for
your help. Tomorrow will you help
me send a message?
Of course. Will you come to bed
now?
I'll sleep here...
Oh, no... please come with me...
I've been sick... I may be tossing
and turning... it wouldn't be fair
to you.
Let me be the judge of that.
Where did you get this?
It's... the first gift you ever
gave me.
... I've got you; it's all right...
Riker to sickbay. The captain's
been hurt.
The nucleonic beam is no longer
scanning, Commander. There is
a narrow reciprocating band
focused directly on Captain
Picard.
Mister Data, find out how that
beam is getting through the
shields and what we can do to cut
it off.
Yes, Commander.
Geordi, start scanning the probe
for any identifying marks,
anything that might tell us where
it came from.
Understood.
Pulse and blood pressure
normal... I'm getting hyperactive
fibrogenic activity... this is
odd...
What is it?
There's no evidence of injury or
trauma... vital signs are normal,
but his neurotransmitter
production is off the scale.
What's going on?
That probe is doing something to
him... Data, any progress?
No, sir. The particle emission
is most unusual. I am unable to
block it.
Destroy the probe. Phasers are
armed and ready.
I don't think that's wise. Not
until we know exactly what it's
doing to him...
Agreed. Stand down phasers,
Mister Worf.
In the meantime, let's see if we
can move out of range. Ensign,
thrusters only... one hundred
kph... nice and easy...
Mister Data?
The probe is moving with us,
sir -- holding relative position.
It's connected itself to him...
like a tether.
You've been dreaming of that
starship again, haven't you?
I'm just charting the sun's
movements. It might give some
clues to the cause of this
drought.
I think you're still trying to
figure out where you are... where
that ship of yours is... what you
can do to get back to that life...
The memory's five years old now,
but it's still inside me.
My other existence may be gone,
but I still wonder about it.
Was it so much better than this
one?
So much more gratifying... so much
more fulfilling... that you cling
to it with such stubbornness?
Eline...
It must have been extraordinary...
but never once, in all the stories
you've told me... have you
mentioned anyone who loved you
as I do.
It was real... as real as this
is. You can't expect me to forget
the lifetime I spent there...
Yes, I can.
I've been patient, Kamin. For
five years I have shared you with
that other life.
I have listened, I have tried to
understand... and I have waited.
When do I get you back?
I know this has been hard for
you...
It's not as though it hasn't been
interesting... all this talk about
starships and distant planets...
I have never been bored.
But I have been lonely. Knowing
that your heart is really...
somewhere else.
You have been amazingly tolerant.
When are you going to let go?
When are you going to start living
this life?
When are we going to start a
family?
Kamin, Eline!
Good morning!
Good morning, Batai...
Are you ready? The administrator
has already arrived.
Yes...
Will you come along?
No, thank you...
... You do very well on your own.
She always was strong-minded.
Even when she was a child.
It isn't her fault. These last
few years have been difficult for
her.
And for you, I think.
There you are, Batai. Perhaps
you can explain to me... when
crops are dying all over, how this
tree is flourishing?
This tree is our symbol... our
affirmation of life. Everyone
in this town gives a part of their
water rations to keep it alive.
We have learned, Administrator,
that hope is a powerful weapon
against anything... even drought.
A good point. Perhaps I will
recommend a symbolic tree in each
of my communities...
Now. What business do we have
today?
We need help if we're to increase
the water supply. We think there
are ways to reclaim some of our
water...
Batai, you're being a bit of an
alarmist. True, we're in a
drought... but water rationing
has produced a sizeable savings.
If the weather pattern doesn't
change, rationing won't be enough.
We will run out of water.
Who's this?
Kamin, sir.
Kamin... do I know you?
No. I haven't spoken to you
before.
Well, Kamin -- I'm open to all
the people of this town. I'm
delighted to hear what you have
to say. Did you have a specific
proposal?
I suggest we build atmospheric
condensers which could extract
water from the air.
Well. Very ambitious. Kamin,
was it? And your occupation is
-- ?
Iron weaving.
And playing the flute.
I don't mean to quash your very
creative idea... but building
atmospheric condensers would be
a monumental undertaking. We
could not hope to sustain such
a project.
Each community would be
responsible for its own. These
condensers could mean the
difference between watering our
crops... or watching them die.
Well -- I'll be glad to pass
along your suggestion. You'll
see that this kind of
participatory government works
for everyone.
Be well, Batai. I shall see you
next month.
Good to meet you, Kanin.
Go carefully, Administrator...
That went very well. I think he
was impressed with you.
We'll never see an atmospheric
condenser...
These things take time. It will
happen, I'm sure of it.
Come to dinner tonight, my friend.
I'll make a vegetable stew. We'll
talk about building our own
condenser.
Kamin --
Hearing you talk to the
Administrator... I realized that
for the first time in years, you
were speaking as though you were
truly a member of the community.
It was good to hear that again.
You've been brooding behind that
flute all evening.
I'm not brooding. I'm immersed
in my music.
Music...
I've found it helps me think.
The real surprise is that I enjoy
it so much.
The real surprise is that you may
actually be improving.
Batai?
Yes, ma'am.
Go home.
Yes, ma'am.
Goodnight, Kamin.
Goodnight, my friend.
Go carefully, Batai.
Don't forget these. I won't put
them away for you again.
Yes, ma'am.
I've done nothing but nag today.
I'm sorry.
I'm the one who's sorry.
Everything you said this morning
was absolutely right.
I've given you so little... and
you have given me so much...
tenderness, patience... and a good
talking to when I needed it.
You've been more than I could ever
have hoped for. More than I
deserve.
You're a good man, a wonderful
husband... I didn't mean to imply
--
Not such a wonderful husband.
I spend my spare time charting
the stars... I disappear for days
at a time exploring the
countryside... and I never put
away my shoes. I lead my life
very much as I did -- before.
Old habits.
You're gentle and kind... you've
never raised your voice to me...
I'd like to ask your permission
to build something.
Kamin, you've built your
telescope, your laboratory -- you
don't need my permission to build
anything...
In this case, I think I do.
What is it?
A nursery.
Really? Really?
Unless you'd rather have a porch.
It'd certainly be easier to
build...
He's showing heightened activity
in the cerebral cortex...
Pulse and blood pressure are
slightly elevated...
Systemic activity?
Increasing. And I'm getting
heightened tactile responses.
Set up a galvanic scan.
Geordi, any progress identifying
the probe?
Maybe. I've picked up some
residue on the probe's shell.
I think it's from the propulsion
system. Looks like it used a
solid propellant as fuel.
Solid propellant?
Sensors read this stuff as
crystalline emiristol. It
produces a radioactive trail that
ought to be traceable.
Then we can send out a probe of
our own. Trace it back to the
point of origin.
I'll get on it.
Commander, I have been analyzing
the nucleonic beam. I believe
it would be possible to reflect
the particles back toward the
probe in a way that would
disrupt the signal.
Doctor... ?
I don't know what it's doing to
him, or what'll happen if we stop
it...
He could be dying by inches...
His vital signs are stable.
There's no indication he's in a
life-threatening situation --
I'm not willing to let that thing
keep drilling into him --
I simply don't know the risk of
shutting down the beam. If
someone gets stabbed, you don't
necessarily pull the knife out
right away -- that might do more
harm than leaving it there.
The captain is under attack. We
must act.
I'm inclined to agree. Doctor,
monitor him closely. Mister Data,
prepare to disrupt the beam.
We're going to try to cut this
cord.
Meribor, this is your brother's
ceremony; now don't fidget.
We name this child for a dear
friend who died last year... but
who will now live on through his
namesake.
We name you -- Batai. In his
honor.
He's starting life in the warmth
of friends. Thank you.
Please, help yourselves to
something to eat.
It seems like just yesterday that
we had Meribor's naming ceremony.
I remember. I was so nervous I
thought I might drop her.
Now look at her... a little
lady...
She's no lady... tromping through
the hills with you all day,
digging those soil samples you
insist on collecting... she's
her father's daughter.
What is it?
I'd always thought I didn't need
children to make my life
complete... now, I can't imagine
life without them.
Kamin!
Get the doctor -- hurry!
I'm losing him!
I'm getting massive somatophysical
failure...
Two cc's delactovine...
Data, get that beam back.
There are severe fluctuations in
the isocortex... synaptic
responses are failing...
Begin full cardiac induction...
Blood pressure is dropping
rapidly... seventy over twenty
--
Data, you have to reestablish
that beam.
I am attempting to do so, Doctor.
Losing response in the isocortex
--
Cortical stimulator...
Start at ten percent...
Doctor, the beam is fully
restored.
Blood pressure up to ninety over
forty...
... and rising...
Isocortical functions are
stabilizing... vital signs
approaching normal levels...
Meribor... ?
Happy day, father...
That's my hobby; find your own.
You're the one who taught me.
Don't complain if you turned me
into a scientist.
And what has the scientist been
up to today?
Analyzing soil samples.
There's not even any anerobic
bacteria. The soil is dead.
This isn't just a long drought,
is it?
I have entries in my log that go
back ten years. You have data
that precedes that by fifteen
years. You've reached the same
conclusion, I know you have.
I haven't reached any conclusion.
A good scientist doesn't function
by conjecture.
A good scientist functions by
hypothesizing and then proving
or disproving that hypothesis.
That's what I've done.
Tell me... why don't you spend
more time with that young fellow
Dannick?
You're changing the subject.
I'm not; I'm hypothesizing that
he's in love with you.
You've taught me to pursue the
truth -- no matter how painful
it might be. It's too late to
back off from that.
I've analyzed the rings in old
trees. I've examined rock strata
to correlate evidence of climactic
changes over the centuries.
Father -- this planet is dying.
Perhaps I should have filled your
head with trivial concerns...
games and toys and clothes...
I don't think you mean that.
No... but it saddens me to see
you bear the burden of knowing
things... things you can't change.
It's no more a burden than you
bear.
But I'm not sixteen. With my life
ahead of me.
Father? I think I should marry
Dannick sooner rather than
later... don't you?
I can only say...
... Live now, Meribor. Always make
"now" the most precious time.
"Now" will not come again.
I love you, father.
Vital signs are holding... he's
been stable ever since the beam
was restored.
I don't know what more to do for
him.
Commander, we're starting to
receive telemetry from the probe
we launched.
Go ahead.
We've charted the alien probe's
radiation trail for just over
one light year.
Can you extrapolate a point of
origin?
Our best guess would be a star
system in the Silarian sector...
Kataan.
Kataan... I've never heard of it.
Data... ?
It is an unmapped system of six
planets.
Any of them inhabited?
Not any longer, sir. The star
went nova. All life in the
system was destroyed
approximately one thousand years
ago.
I put your shoes away for you
again.
Ah. Thank you, dear.
I've been looking through this
thing off and on for almost thirty
years... and I still can't see
what you and Meribor find so
fascinating.
Fine. Then maybe you'll sit down
and rest the way you're supposed
to.
You treat me like some frail
flower. People have surgery all
the time.
He loves playing. And he's very
good at it, you know.
He loves doing a lot of things
-- too many. One week he wants
to be a botanist, the next week
a sculptor. I wish he could find
some focus in his life.
I think he has.
Maybe you should talk to him.
Batai?
Father... ?
I get the feeling from your mother
that you have something to tell
me.
Yes. I was waiting for the right
moment... but that won't ever
come.
I'm leaving school.
Leaving school -- ? No, you're
not --
I want to concentrate on my music.
It's what I care about.
Last year, all you cared about
was mathematics. A year before
that it was botany. Now --
But through it all there was my
music. I think you know that,
father...
This is the life I want.
We'll... we'll discuss it.
Thank you, father.
Even after all these years... you
have the ability to surprise me.
If music is what he wants... why
should I stand in his way?
Who knows how much time he'll
have to follow any dream.
Are you still planning to talk
to the Administrator tomorrow?
Yes.
It's possible he'll dismiss me
from the Council.
Unless, of course, you keep quiet.
The evidence is too pronounced.
I can't stay silent.
What a surprise.
Kamin, what do you hope to
accomplish? Spreading rumors that
the planet is doomed... there
could be chaos.
The facts are here. At least show
them to someone who will recognize
what they mean.
I won't be a party to your making
trouble --
If you won't take them, I most
certainly will.
Your observations... your
findings... our scientists reached
those same conclusions two years
ago.
Well, what did you expect us to
do? Make it public? Can you
imagine the effect... ?
Surely the technology exists to
save something of this world...
perhaps some people could be
evacuated...
Evacuated to where? Our
technology is limited. We're just
beginning to launch small
missiles...
A collection of genetic samples,
then -- something, anything --
you can't just let this
civilization die --
Enough!
There is a plan in the works. I
can't tell you more than that.
Father!
What is it -- ?
It's mother. Hurry.
Doctor -- ?
You see... I'll go to any
lengths... to get your attention.
You always had a flair for the
dramatic...
Doctor... Batai... leave us alone
for a moment. I want to talk to
my husband.
Did the Administrator look at your
evidence?
He didn't have to. They already
know.
So he didn't throw you off the
Council...
No...
Remember -- put your shoes away.
I will.
Doctor...
What is it?
I'm not sure. He's showing
physiological alterations... His
systemic readings are changing...
So are his respiratory functions.
Is he in danger?
I don't know... I don't understand
what's happening. The changes
are subtle, but...
... If I didn't know better, I'd
say these are the metabolic rates
of an eighty-year-old man.
Some children are certainly making
a lot of noise in here.
You shouldn't be out there for
so long. It's damaging, you know
that.
I'm wearing plenty of your skin
protector.
Mmnph.
Do you wear your skin protector
outdoors, young man?
Happy day, everybody! It's time
to go see the launching.
What "launching"? What's he
talking about?
They're sending up a missile,
father. We're going to watch it.
Are we, indeed. I'm not going
anywhere to watch anything.
Come on, Kamie; let's go see the
launching.
Breaks my heart to look at him...
Who?
My grandson. Breaks my heart...
he deserves a full rich life, and
he's not going to get one.
He's my child, and I tell you he
is getting one. I wish it could
be longer, but it's as full and
rich as we can possibly make
it.
Please come, father.
Why didn't I hear anything about
a launching?
Did everyone know about this
except me?
I can see all right from here.
You go on with the others. Go
hold onto my grandson, and watch
the damned thing go up... for all
the good it'll do. What is it
they're launching?
You know about it, father.
You've already seen it.
Seen it? What are you talking
about? I haven't seen any
missile.
Yes, you have, old friend...
Don't you remember?
Batai?
You saw it... just before you came
here.
We hoped our probe would encounter
someone in the future -- someone
who could be a teacher... who
could tell others about us.
A probe... that encounters
someone...
... someone in the future...
... it's me, isn't it? I'm the
someone...
I'm the one it finds... that's
what this launching is -- a probe
that finds me... in the future...
Yes, my love...
Eline...
The rest of us have been gone for
a thousand years...
If you remember what we were, and
how we lived... then we'll have
found life again.
Eline...
Now we live. In you. Tell them
of us... my darling...
Something's happening...
The nucleonic beam has ceased,
Commander. The probe has shut
down.
His cerebral functions are
stabilizing.
Mister Worf, put a tractor beam
on the probe. I want it in
shuttlebay two for examination.
Yes, Commander.
What...
Please, Captain... don't get up
too quickly...
How long? How long have I been...
like this?
At least twenty, maybe twenty-five
minutes.
Twenty-five minutes?
Captain, I need you in sickbay
now. I want to run a full
diagnostic.
Very well, Doctor. But as soon
as you're done... I have a great
deal to tell you.
Come.
Hello, sir. Feeling better?
Yes, thank you... but I find I'm
having to remind myself that this
--
-- is really my home.
We were able to open the probe
and examine it. Whatever it was
that locked onto you must have
been self-terminating. It isn't
functional any longer.
We found this inside.
