			Captain's log, stardate 45376.3.
			We are approaching the planet
			Bilana Three, where a new method
			of propulsion known as the Soliton
			Wave is being developed. The
			Enterprise has been asked to
			participate in one of the first
			tests of this new technology.
			We're going to witness a moment
			in history, Data.
			Every nanosecond in this
			continuum becomes a moment in
			history once it has elapsed.
			No, no. I mean we're going to
			see something that people will
			talk about for years.
			Think about it... no more bulky
			warp engines or nacelles... a
			ship just generates a Soliton
			Wave... and then rides it through
			space like a surfboard.
			This is going to be like being
			there to watch Chuck Yeager break
			the sound barrier, or Zephram
			Cochrane engage the first warp
			drive!
			It should be interesting.
			Very exciting.
			I'm talking to the wrong crowd.
			Donaldson! Hey, Donaldson, can
			you believe that we're actually
			going to be there when they...
			Lieutenant Worf, you have a
			subspace communication from the
			transport ship Milan.
			Transfer the signal to this
			station.
			Hello, Worf.
			Mother?
			I hope you don't mind us dropping
			in on you like this, but when I
			heard the Enterprise was going
			to be in this sector, we took the
			first transport... and here we
			are.
			Is father with you?
			No. I brought Alexander with me.
			I thought the two of you might
			like a chance to... visit.
			Very well. I will make
			arrangements for you to come
			aboard.
			Good.
			It's good to see you, Worf.
			You look wonderful. Is that
			a touch of gray in your beard?
			Don't worry, the Rozhenko men have
			always had beards of iron-gray.
			Hello, Alexander.
			Hello.
			It is good to see you both. How
			long can you stay?
			I'm not going back.
			Did you see Alexander's face when
			he saw the play area? He's going
			to love it here.
			Mother, why does Alexander believe
			he is remaining... ?
			Lapsang suchong tea, please.
			Have you been eating? You look
			thin.
			Mother...
			When your father was in Starfleet,
			I always had to make sure that---
			Mother. We need to talk about
			Alexander.
			Alexander's a fine boy, Worf.
			Smart... high-spirited... a lot
			like you at that age.
			In fact, sometimes he comes
			running through the house and
			knocks over that big green lamp,
			just like you used to do.
			I don't recall you smiling when
			I knocked over that lamp.
			Well... maybe once when you
			weren't looking.
			When we learned that Alexander
			was coming to live with us, we
			were very happy. The house had
			been... empty since you left.
			We thought, here is our chance
			to fill it with the sounds of
			children again.
			But... the truth is... your father
			and I are getting old, Worf.
			Mother, you both still have many
			years---
			I don't mean we're ready for the
			grave... not yet, anyway.
			But we are a little... less
			active. It's hard for us to keep
			up with Alexander. We're ready
			to be... just grandparents.
			Alexander needs to be with his
			father.
			That is not possible. We will
			have to find another option.
			He needs his father, Worf.
			Alexander's having...
			difficulties.
			Difficulties?
			He is... disobedient.
			Klingon children are often...
			difficult to control...
			I do know something about how
			Klingon children behave.
			But it's more than his willful
			attitude. He... does not always
			tell the truth.
			My son is... a liar?
			He is a boy. And boys can
			sometimes take the wrong path.
			They must have guidance.
			Alexander needs a father -- his
			father to give him that guidance.
			I have to go. The transport will
			be returning to Earth shortly.
			Do what you believe is best for
			him, Worf. That's all that any
			parent can hope to do.
			Did you enjoy going to school on
			Earth?
			Yes.
			Did you like your teachers?
			Yes.
			Good.
			I understand that you lived in
			my old room.
			Uh-huh.
			Good.
			Come in.
			Lieutenant Worf, it's good to see
			you again.
			And you must be Alexander. I hear
			you'll be coming to school with
			us for a while?
			Well, we're very excited to have
			you with us... I know the other
			boys and girls will be happy to
			have a new classmate.
			First, I need to get a little
			information from you. Let's start
			with...
			... your name.
			Alexander Rozhenko... hmmmm...
			that's a tough one... maybe you
			can help me. Can you spell your
			last name for me?
			Alexander...
			The teacher asked you a question.
			It doesn't matter. I think I can
			figure it out.
			Date of birth?
			The forty-third day of Maktag,
			stardate 43205.
			Yes... of course.
			I'll get the rest of his personal
			records from the school on Earth.
			One last question... how long will
			he be staying aboard ship?
			It has... not been decided.
			Come.
			I thought our meeting was at
			eleven hundred hours, Mister Worf.
			I apologize for being late,
			Captain. I was detained in...
			school.
			I was enrolling my... son in
			class.
			I see.
			Several officers will be
			transferring aboard next week
			and I'd like to discuss making
			a few personnel changes---
			Kyle to Lieutenant Worf.
			Worf here.
			I'm sorry to bother you again,
			Lieutenant, but I forgot to
			mention that we need to arrange
			for a series of placement
			examinations for Alexander. If
			you could tell me when---
			This is not a good time. I will
			contact you shortly, Ms. Kyle.
			Worf out.
			Sorry, Captain.
			Personnel changes. I'd like you
			to consider transferring Ensign
			Rocha to phaser control and
			promoting Lieutenant---
			Sickbay to Worf.
			Yes, Doctor?
			I need to schedule a physical
			examination for Alexander. I
			also need his complete medical
			records from Earth and---
			Doctor, I would rather discuss
			this at a later time.
			Mister Worf.
			You are not the first officer on
			this ship to have a new family
			member. Take care of your son.
			The personnel changes can wait.
			Thank you, sir.
			Twenty-three field coils, working
			in concert, will generate the
			soliton wave from this point on
			the planet surface.
			We will have the test ship towed
			to a position approximately two
			million kilometers from Bilana
			Three.
			If our theories are correct, the
			wave will envelop the ship and
			push it into warp.
			Warp without warp drive...
			They're going to put you out of
			a job, Geordi.
			I hope so, sir.
			Doctor Ja'Dar, how closely will
			the Enterprise need to follow the
			test vehicle?
			The soliton emits a great deal
			of subspace radio interference.
			You'll need to be within twenty
			kilometers in order to receive
			telemetry.
			How will you end the experiment?
			The wave will be directed toward
			Lemma Two, about three light years
			distance. We have a sister
			facility there which will
			generate a scattering field to
			dissipate the wave, and bring the
			ship out of warp.
			I'll have more detailed
			operational plans sent to you
			within the hour.
			Very well, Doctor. We'll contact
			you again once we've finished
			studying the mission specs.
			Worf... I was just talking with
			Ms. Kyle from the primary school.
			She told me that you enrolled
			Alexander in her class this
			morning.
			Yes.
			I'm sure he'll do well. She's
			a wonderful teacher.
			Good.
			Did she tell you about the
			father/son field trip this
			afternoon?
			Yes. We cannot attend.
			Why not?
			I have a personnel review
			scheduled at thirteen hundred
			hours.
			It might be a good opportunity
			to meet some of the other students
			and parents.
			I might be able to... reschedule
			the review.
			Good. I'll let them know you're
			coming.
			... as the value of their horns
			increased, the number of white
			Rhinos in the wild kept falling
			until they finally became extinct
			about two centuries ago.
			Now I want to show you a pair of
			animals we're trying to save from
			extinction. They're from Corvan
			Two, where their homes in the
			rainforests are being threatened
			by industrial pollutants.
			They're called Corvan Gilvos.
			They're a little shy.
			The eating habits of Gilvos are
			very similar to those of Earth's
			Draco lizards, which died out
			over three hundred years ago...
			There are only fourteen Gilvos
			left on Corvan Two. We're
			transplanting these two to the
			protected planet of Brentalia
			where they should thrive.
			We are hopeful that the population
			can be returned home someday.
			All right everyone, why don't you
			look around for a while on your
			own, and if you have any
			questions, feel free to ask.
			Alexander?
			I forgot to tell everyone that
			the models on the tables are
			supposed to be for all of you
			to play with. So I guess you
			didn't know that you weren't
			supposed to take them.
			I saw you playing with the lizard
			model a little while ago. Do you
			still have it?
			Are you accusing him of stealing?
			Lieutenant Worf---
			Alexander, did you take the model
			of the lizard from the table?
			No, sir.
			Lieutenant... I saw Alexander
			put the model inside his jacket.
			Lieutenant Worf, personal log,
			stardate 45376.8. Alexander has
			acted shamefully and as his
			father, I must now deal with him.
			But I find that I would gladly
			fight ten armed Balduk warriors...
			rather than face one small child.
			A Klingon's honor is more
			important to him than his life.
			A Klingon would gladly face the
			most horrible punishment rather
			than bring shame or disgrace to
			his family name. His word is his
			bond... without it, he is nothing.
			Do you understand?
			Why did you lie to me?
			I don't know.
			Did you fear the punishment you
			would receive?
			I don't know.
			You do not know why you lied, and
			yet you did. You do not know why
			you stole, and yet you did!
			Alexander, come here.
			When I was a child... younger than
			you... I lost my parents, my
			family... my people. Everything
			I had was taken from me... except
			my sense of honor. It was the
			one thing I had which was truly
			Klingon... and which no one could
			take away.
			Do you know who they are?
			Kahless... ?
			And his brother, Morath. They
			fought for twelve days and twelve
			nights... because Morath had
			broken his word... and brought
			shame to his family.
			When you lie or steal, you
			dishonor not only yourself, but
			your family.
			You dishonor me.
			I'm sorry, father. I won't do
			it again. I promise.
			I accept your word. We will not
			speak of this matter again.
			Worf.
			Counselor?
			I just wanted to know how the
			field-trip went yesterday.
			You have not heard?
			No. Why?
			Bridge.
			There was an... incident.
			Alexander stole a small model and
			then... told a falsehood. But
			I have remedied the situation.
			May I ask how?
			I pointed out his error... told
			him about Kahless and Morath...
			and explained the value of honor.
			The boy understood.
			I see.
			Sometimes these things aren't over
			as quickly as they seem to be.
			I'd be happy to help if you have
			any further problems.
			Thank you, but that won't be
			necessary. Alexander will not
			repeat this mistake.
			The prototype has been towed into
			position, Captain.
			Initiate a radio link to the
			ship.
			Link established... receiving
			prelaunch telemetry now.
			Incoming message from Doctor
			Ja'Dar.
			On screen.
			Captain, we're ready to begin the
			launch sequence.
			Mister Riker?
			All science labs standing by.
			Course laid in, sir.
			The Enterprise is ready, Doctor.
			This is Doctor Ja'Dar to all
			stations. You may begin the
			launch sequence.
			Doctor...
			Good luck.
			Thank you, Captain.
			Sensors show the field generators
			on the planet surface are
			charging, sir.
			The soliton wave has been
			initiated... it's heading for
			the test ship.
			The test ship has successfully
			entered warp, sir.
			Engage, Ensign.
			Bring us to twenty kilometers from
			the test ship, Ensign.
			Aye, sir.
			Telemetry looks good... the
			soliton wave is steady...
			The test ship is maintaining warp
			two point three five.
			That's a little faster than they
			anticipated, but it's still well
			within the mission parameters.
			We're at twenty kilometers,
			Captain.
			Is the wave having any effect on
			our own warp drive?
			No, sir. The effect is localized
			to within two kilometers of the
			wavefront.
			Mister LaForge, what is the power
			efficiency of the wave?
			Energy transfer is...
			ninety-eight percent!
			Ninety-eight?
			Yes, sir. There's less than a
			two percent energy loss between
			the wave and the ship.
			That is four hundred fifty
			percent more efficient than our
			own warp drive.
			Astonishing.
			Have science lab three begin a
			series of gamma emissions --
			The wave's power signature is
			fluctuating, Captain.
			Wave efficiency has dropped to
			seventy-three percent...
			The test ship's warp field is
			becoming unstable... sensors show
			multiple disruptions.
			I'm reading a severe subspace
			distortion, sir!
			It is expanding toward us, sir.
			It appears to be interfering with
			our engines.
			I can't compensate for it!
			Take us out of warp, all stop!
			Aye, sir. All stop.
			Damage report.
			Sensors and warp drive are
			off-line... deflectors are down
			to fifteen percent...
			Minor injuries reported on deck
			twenty-seven... no fatalities.
			What happened to the test ship?
			Our last readings indicate the
			craft exploded due to extreme
			shearing stress.
			Incoming message from Bilana
			Three, Captain.
			On screen.
			Are you all right, Captain? Was
			anyone hurt?
			We sustained some minor damage.
			Do you know what happened?
			The preliminary data we have
			received indicate a transient power
			imbalance.
			That would be consistant with our
			telemetry from the ship. We
			detected a sudden drop in transfer
			efficiency just before the
			explosion.
			Are you still tracking the wave?
			No, the explosion damaged our main
			sensor array. But I think we'll
			have it repaired in a couple of
			hours.
			We'll contact you as soon as the
			sensors are back on-line.
			Doctor...
			You did it... warp without warp
			drive... for a while there, it
			was really something to see.
			I hope you're here to see it the
			next time we try, Mister LaForge.
			So do I.
			I apologize that I was detained.
			It's quite all right. Please sit
			down.
			Lieutenant, your son is a very
			bright, very spirited young man.
			From his test scores, I'm sure
			he'll turn out to be one of my
			best students.
			However, from his behavior in
			class so far, I do have some...
			concerns.
			What sort of... concerns?
			Frankly... he's defiant... he's
			overly aggressive toward the other
			students... and he has a great
			deal of difficulty paying
			attention.
			Perhaps you do not have experience
			dealing with Klingon children.
			They require a firm hand.
			And it seems he still has a lot
			of difficulty telling the truth...
			He takes toys from other children
			and then denies taking them...
			he acts like a bully and then says
			someone else started the fight...
			and he's bluntly told me that you
			said "Klingons do not listen to
			teachers."
			I did not tell him that.
			Of course not. He's acting on
			his internal feelings and then
			making up stories to explain them.
			It might be a good idea for the
			two of you to sit down with
			Counselor Troi and try to talk
			this---
			Computer, where is Alexander
			Rozhenko?
			Alexander Rozhenko is in holodeck
			four.
			Lieutenant, I think we should---
			I will handle this.
			Computer, what program is being
			run?
			Calisthenics program of Lieutenant
			Worf. Difficulty level: Novice.
			Freeze program.
			Did you see it, Father? I won.
			Yes, I saw.
			Why are you here?
			I'm training.
			But you did not ask permission
			to take my bat'telh or permission
			to use the holodeck.
			You said you wanted me to be a
			warrior.
			I also said I wanted you to obey
			your teachers and keep your
			promise to me.
			Ms. Kyle has told me about your
			behavior... about your lies.
			I have not lied!
			Alexander, do not continue to---
			She's lying! She hates me, that's
			why she makes up stories about
			me!
			I will not listen to further lies.
			Return to our quarters.
			But you said we could go see the
			Gilvos again.
			Not now. Not after you have
			broken your word.
			You promised. You said that we
			could---
			Enough!
			It is now clear to me that I have
			failed in my duties as your
			father. You have no understanding
			of what it means to be Klingon.
			I will arrange for you to attend
			a Klingon school. There you will
			learn the lessons I have failed
			to teach you.
			No! I won't go!
			Would you dishonor our family
			further with your disobedience?
			No, sir.
			You will go to our quarters and
			remain there until I return.
			Bridge to engineering. What's
			your estimate on the engines,
			Geordi?
			I need another hour, Commander.
			I still have to replace three
			power couplings.
			Understood.
			Sensors coming back on-line, sir.
			Good. Begin a sensor sweep for
			the soliton wave.
			Aye, sir.
			The wave is continuing on course
			for the Lemma Two colony... it
			is bearing zero two zero, mark
			three two nine.
			Open a channel back here to
			Doctor Ja'Dar.
			Sir, the wave has increased in
			velocity. It is now traveling
			at warp four point one.
			Doctor, we've located the soliton
			wave. It's still on course for
			Lemma Two... but its velocity
			has increased to warp four point
			one.
			Have you checked the frequency
			resonance of the subspace --
			Sir, the the wave's energy level
			has increased by a factor of
			twelve.
			At this rate, it will have
			increased by a factor of two
			hundred by the time it reaches
			Lemma Two.
			Will they still be able to
			dissipate the wave?
			Commander, at that energy level,
			the wave will not only destroy
			the colony... it'll take most
			of the planet with it.
			Are you sure this is what you
			want?
			It is not a question of what I
			want... it is a question of what
			is best for the boy. He will be
			better off at a Klingon school.
			Have you discussed this with
			Alexander?
			He is a child. I informed him
			of my decision.
			I see.
			You disapprove?
			I'm not here to approve or
			disapprove of the way you raise
			your son.
			My concern right now is how this
			decision is going to affect you.
			How will you feel when Alexander
			is gone?
			I will be... pleased that he is
			receiving the guidance that he
			requires.
			Is that how you felt when he left
			to live with your parents?
			That was... different. At that
			time, I felt he needed a home...
			a family... things I could not
			provide for him.
			I understand. The idea of raising
			a child can seem like... a
			tremendous burden, particularly
			to a solitary parent.
			He was no burden.
			I simply knew that a Klingon child
			would require more... attention
			than I could provide.
			I see.
			Have you ever wondered how
			Alexander felt about being sent
			away?
			He was very young. I'm sure he
			was... confused...
			Do you think he might have felt...
			abandoned?
			After all, he left very soon after
			K'Ehleyr's death. In a way, he
			not only lost his mother... he
			lost his father as well.
			Are you saying that his...
			misconduct is a result of feeling
			abandoned?
			It's possible. Children don't
			have the experience to handle
			emotional crises. Instead of
			dealing with their feelings, they
			act on them.
			Worf... tell me about the last
			time you spoke with K'Ehleyr...
			the night she died.
			We... argued.
			About what?
			Alexander. Why she had... not
			told me about him when he was
			born.
			So you were angry with her?
			Yes.
			Are you still angry with her?
			Of course not.
			It would be very normal for you
			to be angry with her... angry
			because she died and left you
			alone with a son you never knew
			you had.
			Being angry doesn't mean you loved
			her any less, Worf... but you
			cannot hide from your
			feelings... just as Alexander
			cannot hide from his.
			You both have a lot of healing
			to do... perhaps you should think
			about doing it together.
			Alexander...
			I'm almost done.
			Stop for a moment.
			Let us... talk.
			Why?
			I want you to understand why
			you're going away.
			I understand. You're ashamed of
			me.
			You do not understand. I am
			concerned about your future. A
			Klingon school will be a better
			environment for you.
			You don't care about me.
			That is not true.
			All you care about is your honor!
			Alexander... if your mother were
			here... I do not think she would
			want us to fight like this.
			My mother wouldn't send me away!
			Lieutenant Worf, please report
			to the observation lounge.
			Acknowledged.
			Remain here. I will return
			shortly.
			Report.
			The soliton wave has---
			Excuse me.
			The soliton wave has continued
			to increase in power. Its energy
			level has risen by a factor of
			ninety-six.
			At its present rate of
			acceleration, the wave will hit
			the planet in about two hours.
			How do we stop it?
			There are two possibilities: we
			could try to use our warp engines
			to generate an inverse resonance
			wave. If we match the exact
			frequency and amplitude of the
			soliton, we'd be able to
			neutralize it.
			You don't sound very confident.
			Because the soliton is constantly
			changing in both frequency and
			amplitude, it will be extremely
			difficult to achieve a precise
			match.
			Let's hear the second option.
			It's a little more dangerous, but
			I think there's a better chance
			for success. We could create
			a... backfire -- an explosive
			force set off just in front of
			the soliton wave. A large enough
			explosion... say five photon
			torpedoes... should disrupt the
			wave and allow it to dissipate.
			How fast is the wave travelling
			now?
			Warp six point three seven.
			The good news is we can catch it.
			The bad news is in order to set
			up the backfire we have to be in
			front of it.
			Which would require the Enterprise
			to go through the wave.
			Why can't we go around it?
			The wave has grown in size as well
			as power. There is insufficient
			time remaining for us to
			circumvent it before it reaches
			Lemma Two.
			How much protection will our
			shields provide if we attempt to
			penetrate the wave?
			The shields have not been fully
			restored. Shield strength is down
			to thirty-three percent.
			It would be a rough ride.
			It's the better choice. Number
			One, lay in a course for the
			soliton wave.
			Captain, may I speak with you?
			Certainly.
			I know that I have been distracted
			by... family matters and that I
			have not been performing my duties
			in a satisfactory manner.
			Mister Worf, I have not been
			dissatisfied with your
			performance.
			But I am dissatisfied, Captain.
			And I will be taking steps which
			will remedy the problem.
			I realize that Klingon officers
			do not permit their children to
			live with them.
			However, since you first joined
			Starfleet, you've successfully
			met many challenges that were
			seemingly at odds with your
			Klingon heritage.
			Thank you, sir.
			Ensign, after we've passed through
			the wave, I want you to keep us
			at a relative position
			twenty-three kilometers in front
			of it.
			Aye, sir.
			Alert sickbay to prepare for
			possible casualties.
			Aye, sir.
			The wave has increased speed to
			warp seven point two.
			Take us to warp seven point two
			one.
			We are approaching the wave,
			Captain. Distance... two hundred
			kilometers.
			Let's see it.
			Stand by to increase speed to warp
			seven point three on my mark,
			Ensign.
			Red Alert. Load torpedo bays and
			set warhead yields to level
			sixteen.
			Aye, sir.
			This is the bridge. All decks,
			brace for impact.
			Torpedoes loaded.
			Engage.
			Report.
			We have passed through the wave,
			Captain.
			We have dropped to warp seven
			point two. The wave is directly
			astern at a distance of twenty
			three kilometers.
			Deflector strength down to twelve
			percent. There are fluctuations
			in several warp transfer
			conduits. Transporters and
			tractor beams off-line.
			We have some gaps in the aft
			shields, Captain.
			When the torpedoes explode, these
			areas will be contaminated with
			ion radiation.
			We should evacuate sections
			twenty-four to forty-seven on decks
			thirty-five through thirty-eight.
			Make it so---
			Sir!
			There is a fire in biolab four!
			The fire-suppression apparatus...
			is not functioning.
			Seal off the compartment, prepare
			to vent the air from---
			Sir, there are life-forms present
			in that biolab.
			We're transporting endangered
			animals from Corvan Two...
			Sir, readings also indicate the
			presence of a humanoid.
			Computer, identify the humanoid
			life-form in biolab four.
			Life-form is identified as
			Alexander Rozhenko.
			Bridge to biolab four. Alexander,
			can you hear us?
			Sensors show he is alive... he
			may be injured.
			Can we transport him out of there?
			Transporters are still off-line.
			Captain, warp power is dropping.
			We're losing speed.
			Bridge to engineering. What's
			going on, Geordi?
			We lost four warp transfer
			conduits, Commander.
			The wave is gaining on us, we need
			more speed.
			I doubt I can keep this speed up
			much longer, Commander. You
			better fire those torpedoes while
			we're still in front of the wave.
			Data, how long until the wave
			overtakes us?
			At our current speed... four
			minutes, thirty seconds.
			Captain, permission to leave the
			bridge.
			Granted. Number One, accompany
			Mister Worf to biolab four.
			Sir, biolab four is in one of the
			areas that will be flooded with
			ion radiation.
			Commander.
			I can't let the soliton wave hit
			the colony. You have three
			minutes... not one second more.
			Primary control's shorted out.
			Stand clear.
			Alexander!
			Alexander!
			Alexander, can you hear me?
			The soliton wave has closed to
			ten kilometers, Captain.
			Stand by to fire torpedoes on my
			command.
			I've found him, Commander!
			Worf!
			Over here!
			It's too heavy. We need
			something to help us.
			Father?
			Be still, I am here.
			My leg hurts. I'm scared.
			The Gilvos! Don't leave them
			here!
			There's no time.
			They'll die! Please!
			The wave has closed to one
			kilometer, Captain.
			Picard to Commander Riker.
			Bridge to Lieutenant Worf,
			acknowledge.
			The wave is about to overtake us,
			sir.
			Commander Riker, acknowledge!
			Fire torpedoes.
			The wave has been disrupted,
			Captain.
			Picard to Riker.
			Riker here, Captain.
			We made it, sir. The boy's going
			to be all right.
			You're a very lucky little boy...
			just some minor smoke inhalation
			and a hairline fracture of the
			tibia.
			That's a bone in your leg.
			I'd like to keep him overnight,
			but he should be fine by
			tomorrow.
			Thank you, Doctor.
			Are you going to get in trouble
			because of me?
			Do not concern yourself with that.
			Am I in trouble?
			Yes... but we will discuss that
			at a later time.
			I'm sorry.
			I promise I'll be good at the
			Klingon school. I'll make you
			proud of me.
			Klingon schools are designed to
			be difficult.
			The physical and mental hardships
			faced by the students are meant
			to build strength and character.
			However, if you wish to face a
			greater challenge... you may stay
			here with me.
			It will not be easy... for either
			one of us... but, perhaps we can
			face the challenge together.
			I accept your challenge, Father.
			I will stay.
			I believe your... mother would
			be pleased.
