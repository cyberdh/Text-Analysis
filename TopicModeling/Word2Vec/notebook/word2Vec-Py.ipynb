Lemmatization is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item, and identified by the word's lemma, or dictionary form. In computational linguistics, lemmatisation is the algorithmic process of determining the lemma of a word based on its intended meaning. Unlike stemming, lemmatisation depends on correctly identifying the intended part of speech and meaning of a word in a sentence, where as stemming does not take the context of the word into account. For example, if we lemmatize the word \"running\" or \"ran\" it will become the word \"run\". If we stem the word \"running\" most stemmers will convert it to \"runn\" only removing the \"ing\" and leaving the second \"n\". Stemming will also change \"police\" and \"policy\" both to \"polic\" and they will be considered the same word by the LDA script. The lemmatizer will leave both words as \"police\" and \"policy\". This is useful and recommended for topic modeling as it allows the algorithm to just consider \"walk\" instead of \"walking\", \"walked\", and \"walk\" and thereby can increase the accuracy of your results. To use the spacy lemmatizer set `spacyLem` equal to **True**. If you do not wish to use the lemmatizer set `spacyLem` equal to **False**.\n",

    "### Find Bigrams and Trigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will most likely not need to be adjusted. It creates a model of bigrams and trigrams in your dataset that occur frequently and then connects them with an underscore so the LDA algorithm will later consider them as one word. This is a good idea for items like 'new york' or 'new zealand' or 'Ho Chi Minh'. If we do not combine these frequently occuring phrases then 'new' and 'york' will be considered independently and give us less accurate results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Right now we have a `min_count` of 5 and a `threshold` of 100. The `min_count` is simply the minimum number of times the bigram or trigram needs to occur in order to be combined with an underscore. The `threshold` is a score that the bigram or trigram needs to exceed in order to be combined with an underscore. The score is determined by using this formula: (bigram_count - min_count)\\*vocab_count/(wordA_count \\* wordB_count). So let's say we have the bigram \"good_lord\" and it appears 30 times in a text of 10,000 words where \"good\" appears 60 times total and \"lord\" appears 40. With our `min_count` set to 5 we get the following: (30 - 5)\\*10000/(60 \\* 40) = 104.167 which means since our `threshold` is set to 100 \"good_lord\" will be combined with an underscore and made into a bigram. If the resulting score is above your `threshold` then the ngram is considered important enough to combine with an underscore and will be viewed as one word for the LDA scoring later. Therefore, if you increase the `threshold`, you will get fewer bigrams and trigrams. If our threshold was set to 110, then \"good\" and \"lord\" would not be combined into \"good_lord\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The Phraser function takes the model you built with the Phrases function and cuts down memory consumption of Phrases, by discarding model state not strictly needed for the bigram detection task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we take a look at the ngrams created from the first item in our dataset only, so the results are for only one chunk, not the whole dataset. We do this by counting the number of words that contain an underscore as this is used to connect the words in the ngram together. **NOTE:** The output is only to test if the ngrams work so you will probably see ngrams containing stopwords. We will create a few functions next and then apply them to remove stopwords, create bigrams, and lemmatize the chunk."
